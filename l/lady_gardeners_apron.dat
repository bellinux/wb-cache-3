40|$|The Post-Industrial era {{in which}} we live reveals how the media {{institutions}} have changed in regard to children. The number of software applications directed and vehiculated towards them, essentially by new media, createan impact on educators who interact with children and with parents who respond to a child’s decision-making capacities and influential abilities. It is fascinating to verify how adults are pleased and willing to learn from children. It should be noted that in Portugal 61 % of households with children have two or more computers, 39 % of Portuguese children between the ages 4 and 5 use the internet regularly, 67 % of children between the ages 6 and 7 use computers on a daily basis and 78 % of children ages 8 or 9 and up, use the computer on a regular basis. One of these software applications, available for free, is called Scratch, created by Mitchel Resnick, Professor at MIT, who recognizes the new children’s status, regarding the process of communicative, reflective, creative and playful child co-participation. This application was translated into Portuguese and made available in Portugal by Portal SAPO Kids, which belongs to the company Portugal Telecom. In the sphere of action of the project "Scratch'ando com o Sapo", from the Sapo Laboratory at the University of Aveiro, tutorials were built – action guides to promote and develop play, work and study activities for various segments of Scratch users. The "Scratch'ando com o Sapo" guardians are the characters that guide the children through the choices available. In terms of design, the creation of these characters were based on a set of data collected from the observation of participants and the gathering of guidelines of children from different project groups. Separated into three age groups – 3 - 6 years, 7 - 9 years and 10 - 12 years – the guardians represent the child’s visual universe and can therefore be easily identified by each of the referring age groups to which they belong. This equally applies to the accessories that characterize each of the characters, contributing to the understanding of both their visual and verbal recognition. Thus Pópia and Pópio guide the actions of {{children between the ages of}} 3 and 6 and have as attire a doll, a ball, a book and tools. Argus and Sylla with ages between 7 and 9 years are attired with super hero costumes, stars, an ipod, hair adornment and a karaoke microphone. Bicuda and Bilóca, between the ages of 10 and 12, show off a wallet, rings, a <b>gardener’s</b> <b>apron,</b> tools for nature care and a fruit basket. Also in regard to illustration options that were taken, is important to note the use of strong and bright flat colours, simple strokes with little texture and minimal visual noise, not exaggerating with details, not only due to the fact that the guardians are to be viewed primarily in small format on the computer screen, but, also, to be able to maintain the user’s focus of attention towards what is essential...|$|R
40|$|Garden developments: {{success of}} his {{recently}} constructed mushroom house, adapted from [Isaac] Oldacre's [(fl 1810 s- 1852), <b>Lady</b> Banks' <b>gardener</b> at Spring Grove, Isleworth, Middlesex] engraved plan but with flue above ground; explains benefits with small ink sketch. New peach house: Oldacre recommends "noblesse" and "Galande" as those which force best, but [James] Lee prefers the "Buckingham mignon"; details of the building. Regrets missing the recent show of fruits at the Horticultural Society. Intends to try Lee's recommendation of Verdeltro grapes; reported to be very hardy {{and one of the}} grapes Madeira wine is made from. His daughter and Lady George Murray prefer the green Egyptian melon to any other. One of [Erik] Pontoppidan's [(1698 - 1764), Danish bishop] sea serpents "seems to have got down the American coast - to gobble up herrings!". Recently received 'Linnaea' specimen from [James] Brodie. Praises botanical zeal of Miss Murray, Lady George's unmarried daughter; she began with mosses and would walk five miles to find a 'Phuscum' and brought many mosses from Isle of Man; compares her beginning and Joseph Dalton's with 'Carex' to beginning music with thoroughbass. Has an ear of 'Talavera' wheat from near Cirencester, [Gloucestershire], and two from Gordon Castle, [Moray]. Ate last green melon yesterday, small but excellent. Prices of apples: abundance of French apples at York imported to Hull, [Yorkshire], at 16 / per bushel; recently given 20 / for natives and 24 / at Thirsk, [Yorkshire], his gardener thinks the French "most like cur Hawthorn Dean"...|$|R
