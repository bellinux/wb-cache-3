5000|$|KiXtart (.kix) — {{developed}} by a Microsoft employee in 1991, specifically to meet the need for commands useful in a network <b>logon</b> <b>script</b> while retaining the simple 'feel' of a [...]cmd file.|$|E
5000|$|KiXtart is {{a closed}} source free-format {{scripting}} language for Windows. It {{is described as}} a <b>logon</b> <b>script</b> processor and enhanced batch scripting language by the official website. Its name is a portmanteau of [...] "kick start".|$|E
50|$|Ignition uses an {{implementation}} of Python version 2.5 called Jython. Python script {{is used for}} component Event Handling. An example {{of this would be}} opening a popup window when a user clicks on a graphic object. Another common use are event scripts such as a timer that checks for alarms or a <b>logon</b> <b>script.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Development of KiXtart as a <b>logon</b> <b>scripting</b> {{language}} {{started in}} 1991. Later versions were released on these dates: ...|$|R
50|$|Samba {{configuration}} {{is achieved}} by editing a single file (typically installed as /etc/smb.conf or /etc/samba/smb.conf). Samba can also provide user <b>logon</b> <b>scripts</b> and group policy implementation through poledit.|$|R
50|$|Windows XP {{includes}} a Fast Logon Optimization feature that performs logon asynchronously {{without waiting for}} the network to be fully initialized if roaming user profiles are not set up. Use of cached credentials avoids delays when logging on to a domain. Group Policy is applied in the background, and startup or <b>logon</b> <b>scripts</b> execute asynchronously by default.|$|R
50|$|Network drives {{are often}} {{assigned}} letters {{towards the end}} of the alphabet. This is often done to differentiate them from local drives: by using letters towards the end, it reduces the risk of an assignment conflict. This is especially true when the assignment is done automatically across a network (usually by a <b>logon</b> <b>script).</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{white paper}} gives an {{overview}} of the scripting possibilities offered by the Windows Script Host (WSH) and Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI) components under Windows 2000. It explains the basic concepts and practices related to WSH and ADSI. After a WSH architectural overview, the document explains how to use this technology to access basic Windows system components. This paper also provides a general ADSI architectural overview and explains the basic access methods for the Active Directory. Through several simple examples, the reader will discover how to combine WSH functions with ADSI components in order to build a <b>Logon</b> <b>Script</b> under Windows 2000. Acknowledgments...|$|E
5000|$|Servers running Unix or Linux {{with the}} free Samba suite (or certain Windows Server {{products}} - Windows Home Server excluded) can provide domain control, custom <b>logon</b> <b>scripts,</b> and roaming profiles to users of certain versions of Windows. This allows a user to log on from any machine in the domain and have access to her or his [...] "My Documents" [...] and personalized Windows and application preferences - multiple accounts on each computer in the home are not needed.|$|R
25|$|By default, Microsoft Windows refreshes {{its policy}} {{settings}} every 90 minutes with a random 30 minutes offset. On Domain controllers, Microsoft Windows does so every five minutes. During the refresh, it discovers, fetches and applies all GPOs {{that apply to}} the machine and to logged-on users. Some settings - such as those for automated software installation, drive mappings, startup <b>scripts</b> or <b>logon</b> <b>scripts</b> - only apply during startup or user logon. Since Windows XP, users can manually initiate a refresh of the group policy by using the gpupdate command from a command prompt.|$|R
50|$|The Advanced Server is {{designed}} to manage the workstation computers. It can function as a Domain controller, where all users and {{groups as well as}} their rights are stored. This way, a user can log on from any computer in the network, and users can be managed centrally on the server. Trust relationships can be built to other domains to be able to exchange data cross-domain. Using the replication service, files like <b>logon</b> <b>scripts</b> can be synchronized across all computers on the network. The Advanced Server supports the AppleTalk protocol to allow connections to Macintosh computers. Hard drives can be combined to RAIDs in Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, the supported configurations are RAID 0, RAID 1 and RAID 5.|$|R
50|$|Windows 2000 {{introduced}} Windows Script Host 2.0 {{which included}} an expanded object model {{and support for}} <b>logon</b> and logoff <b>scripts.</b>|$|R
50|$|This also solves {{a problem}} related to User Account Control (UAC) on Windows Vista and newer. When an {{administrator}} is logged on and UAC is enabled, and {{they try to}} run a batch file as administrator from a network drive letter, using the right-click file context menu, the operation will unexpectedly fail. This is because the elevated UAC privileged account context does not have network drive letter assignments, {{and it is not}} possible to assign drive letters for the elevated context via the Explorer shell or <b>logon</b> <b>scripts.</b> However, by creating a shortcut to the batch file using the above PUSHD / POPD construct, and using the shortcut to run the batch file as administrator, the temporary drive letter will be created and removed in the elevated account context, and the batch file will function correctly.|$|R
50|$|Samba sets up network {{shares for}} chosen Unix {{directories}} (including all contained subdirectories). These appear to Microsoft Windows users as normal Windows folders accessible via the network. Unix users can either mount the shares directly {{as part of}} their file structure using the smbmount command or, alternatively, can use a utility, smbclient (libsmb) installed with Samba to read the shares with a similar interface to a standard command line FTP program. Each directory can have different access privileges overlaid on top of the normal Unix file protections. For example: home directories would have read/write access for all known users, allowing each to access their own files. However they would still not have access to the files of others unless that permission would normally exist. Note that the netlogon share, typically distributed as a read only share from /etc/samba/netlogon, is the logon directory for user <b>logon</b> <b>scripts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Established in 1991, Georgia SoftWorks [...] {{started as}} a custom {{software}} development company specializing in data communications and telecommunications applications. The company needed reliable Telnet connectivity on Windows NT with features such as: correctly displayed characters, proper function key operation and alt-key operation. At the time, Telnet was widely available on Unix but not frequently utilized on Windows in commercial environments. Georgia SoftWorks developed the GSW Telnet Server for Windows, and it named its foundation product the [...] "Universal Terminal Server". It was designed so that different protocols could be installed as requirements determined. GSW added features to its telnet server such as mouse operation and file transfer over a telnet connection. After successful in-house use, the UTS was commercialized. Georgia SoftWorks developed major features for its UTS such as Logon Scripts; this feature eventually evolved into global, per user, per IP Address and Certificate Based <b>Logon</b> <b>Scripts.</b> Other features included client device failure detection, Graceful Termination, Session Saver, Automatic Logon, Session Monitoring, Shadowing and Team Services technology.|$|R
30|$|Whilst not fitting {{directly}} into the MOOC model, the data capture, analysis, and reporting model that eRegister represents is easily extendable into many metrics. As mentioned earlier, the issue of data capture is not as nearly problematic than the analysis of that data. In this scenario, eRegister captures all forms of student attendance (i.e., lecture or lab). Various vectors were employed ranging from direct entry (via eRegister produced printouts), to RFID scanning to post <b>logon</b> Windows NT.x <b>scripts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Windows Script Host may be {{used for}} a variety of purposes, {{including}} <b>logon</b> <b>scripts,</b> administration and general automation. Microsoft describes it as an administration tool. WSH provides an environment for scripts to run - it invokes the appropriate script engine and provides a set of services and objects for the script to work with. These scripts may be run in either GUI mode (WScript.exe) or command line mode (CScript.exe) offering flexibility to the user for interactive or non-interactive scripts. WSH implements an object model which exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces. So in addition to ASP, IIS, Internet Explorer, CScript and WScript, the WSH can be used to automate and communicate with any Windows application with COM and other exposed objects, such as using PerlScript to query Microsoft Access by various means including various ODBC engines and SQL, ooRexxScript to create what are in effect Rexx macros in Excel, Quattro Pro, Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes and any of the like, the XLNT script to get environment variables and print them in a new TextPad document, The VBA functionality of Microsoft Office, Open Office(as well as Python and other installable macro languages) and Corel WordPerfect Office is separate from WSH engines although Outlook 97 uses VBScript rather than VBA as its macro language. Python in the form of ActiveState PythonScript can be used to automate and query the data in SecureCRT, as with other languages with installed engines, e.g. PerlScript, ooRexxScript, PHPScript, RubyScript, LuaScript, XLNT and so on. One notable exception is Paint Shop Pro, which can be automated in Python by means of a macro interpreter within the PSP programme itself rather than using the PythonScript WSH engine or an external Python implementation such as Python interpreters supplied with Unix emulation and integration software suites like MKS Toolkit, CygWin et al. as an intermediate and indeed can be programmed like this {{even in the absence of}} any third-party Python installation; the same goes for the Rexx-programmable terminal emulator Passport [...] The programmability of Take Command and 4NT in the latest implementations (by means of [...] "@REXX" [...] and so on) generally uses the WSH engine. The ZOC terminal emulator gets its ability to be programmed in Rexx by means of an external interpreter, one of which is supplied with the programme, and alternate Rexx interpreters can be specified in the configuration of the programme.|$|R
40|$|Interconnected {{collection}} of autonomous computers called computer network. Most {{of the computer}} users participated in internet or intranet users. Network technologies included the function of exchange the information, data, application, and files are stored, modified and deleted. This stage most important factor is to secure the information store by a user. Data’s safety is {{most important factor in}} the processes. So design and secure the policies to apply the environment of network are necessary. Network security involves all activities that organizations, enterprises, and institutions undertake to protect the value and ongoing usability of assets and the integrity and continuity of operations. Design the network configuration is essential thought of network security. At presently many organizations using attendance system in smart card or fingerprint system. Biometric system or smart card system use to create login <b>script</b> (<b>logon</b> process) and avoid unwanted unauthorized users. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} avoid unnecessary “unauthorized access ” to providing security through biometric system or token card system...|$|R
