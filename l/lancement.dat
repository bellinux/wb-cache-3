Following the retirement of the Ariane 4 in favour of the Ariane 5, ELA-2 was deactivated. In September 2011 the pad's mobile service tower was demolished using explosives.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment {{engaged in}} Operation Carbet (Opération Carbet), in Haiti. In 2008, the {{president}} of the republic launched Operation Harpie (Opération Harpie), with point to combat illegal activities in deep jungle (mainly illegal gold-mining activities). This mission became permanent and was also reinforced in 2010. The regiment was mainly in charge of sector Oyapock, at the Brazilian frontier, while supporting forces of the gendarmerie. At end of 2011, while the Ensemble de <b>Lancement</b> Soyouz became operational, the Regiment ensured protection around the area.|$|E
50|$|The Sylver (SYstème de <b>Lancement</b> VERtical) is a {{vertical}} launching system (VLS) designed by DCNS. The launcher comes in several variants, each distinguished by their height. A-35 and A-43 were developed for launching short range surface-to-air missiles, the A-50 for the long-range PAAMS air defense system, and the A-70 launcher for larger missiles {{such as the}} SCALP Naval land attack cruise missile. The numbers refer to the approximate length of the missile which can be accommodated, in decimetres, i.e. the A-43 can hold missiles which are up to 4.3 metres long whilst the A-70 can accommodate missiles up to 7 metres long.|$|E
50|$|Soyuz-2 rockets {{were first}} {{launched}} from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and Site 43 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived rockets including the Soyuz-U and Molniya. Commercial Soyuz-2 flights are contracted by Starsem, and have launched from Site 31 at Baikonur and ELS (l'Ensemble de <b>Lancement</b> Soyouz), {{which has been}} built at the Guiana Space Centre on the northern coast of South America. The Soyuz-2 version ST-B can deliver 3250 kg to geostationary transfer orbit from this equatorial site. In 2016 the new Vostochny Cosmodrome started operating Soyuz-2 flights as well, from its first launch pad called Site 1S.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{short period}} of {{practice}} with his father, the boy was enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent. His first painting, [...] "The pâtre" [...] is sold at the Triennale in Ghent. In 1888, when he was only 15 years old, he made his debut at the [...] "Salon des Champs-Elysées" [...] in Paris with his monumental work [...] "The <b>lancement</b> d'Argo." [...] The canvas 7.5 meters by 2.6, caused quite a stir for the nakedness of his characters. The boy, called to Paris, amazed viewers for his young age and, to everyone's surprise, he obtained a [...] "special mention". However, in order to expose the picture, his characters were [...] "covered" [...] with drapery.|$|E
50|$|The rocket {{was used}} {{in a number of}} {{variants}} - it could be fitted with two or four additional solid (PAP - Propulseurs d'appoint à poudre) or liquid fueled booster rockets (PAL - Propulseurs d'appoint à liquide). The launcher included a satellite payload carrier system called Spelda (Structure porteuse externe de <b>lancement</b> double Ariane, French for 'External carrying structure for Ariane double launches') for launching more than one satellite at a time. The rocket captured nearly 60% of the world’s commercial launch services market, serving both European and international clients. Atop the third stage was a vehicle equipment stage which housed a computer that performed various functions, including sequencing, guidance, control, tracking, telemetry and an explosive-based self-destruct.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} flight, {{designated}} as L-O1 (<b>Lancement</b> Launch 01), the payload consisted of an Aeritalia-built test instrumentation system, known as CAT (Capsule Ariane Technologique), {{for the purpose}} of measuring all key stages of the ascent in great detail, such as noise, stress, acceleration, temperature, and pressure; this unit was also designed to simulate a real satellite payload. CAT was successfully placed into an orbit of 202km by 35,753km; the successful deployment of this payload indicated the end of the American monopoly on commercial satellite launches. On 26 March 1980, almost immediately after the success of LO-1, CNES and ESA created a new company {{for the purpose of}} promoting, marketing, and managing Ariane operations, choosing to name the venture Arianespace.|$|E
50|$|When the Ariane 1 {{programme}} was started, {{to replace}} the failed ELDO programme, a new launch site {{was built on the}} site of the former CECLES pad. This was designated Ensemble de <b>Lancement</b> Ariane, or ELA for short. The first Ariane 1 launch occurred on 24 December 1979. ELA was also used by Ariane 2 and 3 rockets, which first flew on 31 May 1986 and 4 August 1984 respectively. ELA was redesignated ELA-1 when the Ariane 4 entered service in 1988, as this launched from a separate launch pad, designated ELA-2. The Ariane 1 was retired on 22 February 1986, the Ariane 2 on 2 April 1989, and the Ariane 3 on 12 July 1989. ELA was subsequently demolished.|$|E

50|$|The Arianespace Soyuz {{project was}} {{announced}} by the ESA in 2002. Cooperation with Russia began in two areas: construction of a launch site for Soyuz in CSG {{and development of the}} Soyuz launch vehicle modified for the Guiana Space Centre. A Programme Declaration was signed in 2003 and funding along with final approval was granted on 4 February 2005. Initial excavation for the Ensemble de <b>Lancement</b> Soyouz (ELS; Soyuz Launch Complex) began in 2005, construction started in 2007, and the launch complex was completed in early 2011, allowing Arianespace to offer launch services on the modified Soyuz ST-B to its clients. Two early flights, VS02 and VS04, used the Soyuz ST-A variant. Since 2011, Arianespace has ordered a total of 23 Soyuz rockets, enough to cover its needs until 2019 at a pace of three to four launches per year.|$|E
50|$|The Ariane 4 was the {{ultimate}} development from the preceding members of the Ariane rocket family. Compared with the Ariane 2 and 3, the Ariane 4 featured a stretched first (by 61 per cent) and third stages, a strengthened structure, new propulsion bay layouts, new avionics, and the SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe de <b>Lancement</b> Double Ariane) dual-payload carrier. The basic 40 version did not employ any strap-on motors, while the Ariane 42L, 44L, 42P, 44P, and 44LP variants all used various combinations of solid and liquid boosters. Originally designed to place 2-4.2 tonne payloads in geostationary orbit, the six Ariane 4 variants, aided by strap-on boosters, enabled the launch of payloads in excess of 4.9 tonnes on several occasions. According to Harvey, the Ariane 4 launcher had reduced the launch costs per kilo by 55 per cent {{in comparison to the}} original Ariane 1.|$|E
