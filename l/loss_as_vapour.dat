40|$|Metabolic {{studies were}} {{performed}} on men exposed to nitrobenzene vapour under experimental condi-tions. Absorption was estimated by the analysis of urine for p-nitrophenol. About half <b>as</b> much <b>vapour</b> was absorbed through the skin as through the lungs. In inhalation studies the accumulation of nitrobenzene {{in the course of}} repeated exposures was investi-gated. It was found that p-nitrophenol was excreted in the urine in increasing amounts on successive days of exposure, reaching, by the end of a week, levels approximately {{two and a half times}} as high as on the first day. The specificity of the p-nitrophenol test on urine was studied using rats. Of all nitro-compounds investigated only chloronitrobenzenes, especially the ortho-isomer, gave interfering compounds in the urine. o-Chloronitrobenzene gave lower results than nitrobenzene by a factor of 3. There are three important ways in which nitro-benzene may be absorbed under industrial condi-tions: <b>as</b> <b>vapour</b> through the lungs; as liquid through the skin; and <b>as</b> <b>vapour</b> through the skin.

40|$|Pesticides can {{be present}} in the {{atmosphere}} either <b>as</b> <b>vapours</b> and/or in association with suspended particles. High-volume air sampling, in which air is aspirated first through a glass fibre filter to capture pesticides associated with atmospheric particulates and then polyurethane foam (PUF), often in combination with an adsorbent resin such as XAD- 2, to capture pesticides present <b>as</b> <b>vapours,</b> is generally employed during atmospheric monitoring for pesticides. However, the particulate fraction may be underestimated because some pesticides may be stripped or desorbed from captured particulates due to the pressure drop created by the high flow of air through the filter. This possibility was investigated with ten herbicide active ingredients commonly used on the Canadian prairies (dimethylamine salts of 2, 4 -D, MCPA and dicamba, 2, 4 -D 2 -ethylhexyl ester, bromoxynil octanoate, diclofop methyl ester, fenoxaprop ethyl ester, trifluralin, triallate and ethalfluralin) and seven hydrolysis products (2, 4 -D, MCPA, dicamba, bromoxynil, diclofop, clopyralid and mecoprop). Finely ground heavy clay soil fortified with active ingredients/hydrolysis products was evenly distributed on the glass fibre filters of high-volume air samplers and air aspirated through the samplers at a flow rate of 12. 5 m 3 /h for a 7 -day period. The proportion desorbed <b>as</b> <b>vapour</b> from the fortified soil was determined by analysis of the PUF/XAD- 2 resin composite cartridges. The extent of desorption from the fortified soil applied to the filters varied from 0 % for each of the dimethylamine salts of 2, 4 -D, MCPA and dicamba to approximately 50 % for trifluralin, triallate and ethalfluralin...|$|R

As the links are complex between actual inputs of mercury to society (consumption for intended use and mobilisation of mercury-impurities via industrial processes) and the final release sources, all types of measures addressing any phase in the life-cycle of mercury which may ultimately lead to atmospheric mercury emissions are included here. Due to its volatility, most forms of mercury released or discarded as waste - <b>as</b> <b>vapour,</b> <b>as</b> liquid elemental mercury, as compounds, as integrated in products, consumer waste or flue-gas cleaning residues - may lead to emissions to air. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of nanowire structures from poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) in solution {{is of great}} interest in fields such <b>as</b> <b>vapour</b> sensing and organic solar cells. Being able to control formation, deposition and characterise these nanowires is therefore {{of great interest to}} maximise the potential of these devices. To this end this research investigates the growth of these nanowires in solution via small angle neutron scattering, and ultra-violet visible spectroscopy. The ability to align these nanowires on a solid substrate is also of interest, as well as obtaining large quantities of aligned and densely packed nanowires. Therefore this thesis has investigated optimal processing conditions, deposition methods and post processing methods to get the optimal P 3 HT nanowires and nanowire alignment. Various methods of characterising the nanowires, such as ultra-violet visible spectroscopy, small angle neutron scattering, atomic force microscopy etc. have been used to characterise the nanowires that were created. These nanowires were also tested for use in applications such <b>as</b> <b>vapour</b> sensing, by use in water-gated transistors and the effects of using nanowires, rather than a thin film of P 3 HT was also investigated. In summary, various techniques for the production and optimisation of P 3 HT nanowire thin films were investigated, the growth of which was also carefully studied. Finally the nanowire films were characterised using various methods and applications tested to determine how to use nanowires to optimise these applications, namely for the purpose of vapour sensing...|$|R
