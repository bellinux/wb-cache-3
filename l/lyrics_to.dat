5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> every song the group {{performed}} {{until his death}} on April 17, 2008. In writing the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to empathize with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E

5|$|The album {{maintains}} the ska punk and reggae influences of the band's previous work, but with slower, more ballad-like songs. The <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> {{many of the}} songs describe singer Gwen Stefani's pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with her commitment to a music career.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> realistic subject matter most could relate to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the city}} was the {{production}} site of the 1991 Romanian drama Undeva în Est ("Somewhere in the East"), and the 1995 Hungarian language film A Részleg ("Outpost"). Moreover, the Romanian-language film Cartier ("Neighbourhood", 2001) and its sequel Înapoi în cartier ("Back to the Neighbourhood", 2006) both feature a story replete with violence and rude language, behind the blocks in the city's Mănăștur district. This district is also mentioned in the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the song Înapoi în cartier by La Familia member Puya, featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture.|$|E

5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly {{fill in for}} a show or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't {{know any of the}} <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the tracks}} {{appeared}} in studio form on the band's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, albeit with different <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the performance here. The band's set has since been released on CD, with some bonus material. Recalling the event, Fripp remembers {{the sense of community}} at the event and the good weather, particularly noting a sense of goodwill backstage.|$|E

5|$|Tommy was {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with artwork designed by McInnerney, {{which included a}} booklet including lyrics and images to illustrate parts of the story. The cover is presented {{as part of a}} triptych-style fold-out cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme being prepared for shows, that carried a detailed synopsis.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Shaw {{returned}} to the Embassy Theatre to direct Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Gambler.

In 1956, he played the title role in the first British production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Everyman. That same year, he wrote the <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> his father's ballad-opera, All at Sea, which played at the Royal College of Music. In 1957, he played Lucifer in Brother Lucifer in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and a sinister Venetian agent in Jonathan Griffin's The Hidden King in Edinburgh.|$|E

When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) {{is going to the}} hunting trip with Mark, April offers to give him a hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{started writing}} songs for Channel Orange in February 2011 with {{songwriter}} and producer Malay, {{his friend and}} creative partner since their start {{in the music industry}} as songwriters. They originally met in Atlanta and worked for the same publishing company, through which they reconnected after Malay moved to Los Angeles. Ocean more spent time with Malay, introducing him to his Odd Future collective, while connecting creatively through their respective songwriting, which led to their partnership for Channel Orange. For the album, Ocean wrote his <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> complement Malay's ideas for the music. Occasionally, they wrote songs together by improvising musical ideas from Malay's keyboard and guitar playing. Channel Orange was written in two weeks, according to the singer.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable <b>lyrics</b> <b>to</b> be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
