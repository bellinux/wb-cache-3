25|$|The six {{undergraduate}} residential {{colleges have}} separate, unique housing facilities for their students. First-year students are usually {{housed in the}} residence halls while upperclassmen live in the college apartments. Transfer students are housed in separate facilities from the residential colleges, in an area adjacent to Eleanor Roosevelt College called The Village at Torrey Pines. The housing facilities vary in design, though {{nearly all of them}} are of modern or brutalist style. The vast majority of entering freshmen and about 40 percent of all undergraduates in Fall 2012 chose to live in campus residence halls or apartments, with roughly 70 percent of all incoming freshman living in triple occupancy rooms. Graduate students can choose to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of six apartment complexes apart from undergraduate housing. Three of these facilities are several minutes away from UC San Diego while the remaining are located on university grounds.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{believes}} that the Plan of Action formulated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 will influence forestry development throughout {{the world in the}} years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new knowledge, new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly {{believes that}}, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of forest land tenure, governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the forest, ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the forests are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time. Since we <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> world, and since the forest resources of the world are unevenly distributed, national policies and plans must take account of the international context.|$|E
25|$|The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (O.S.A.), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, {{they pray}} the Liturgy of the Hours {{throughout}} the day. This Latin Rite Order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic Orders in three ways: 1) They {{do not take}} vows of stability, meaning that they can <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the Order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission work, education, prison ministries, etc. The Order is {{under the supervision of}} a Prior General in Rome, and as an international Order they are divided into various Provinces throughout the world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial; (3) As an Order, they have a special commitment to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated {{as it was in the}} origins of the Order, this is to be a distinguishing mark of their lives as a community.|$|E
