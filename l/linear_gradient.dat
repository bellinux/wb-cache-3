40|$|High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) {{has been}} a {{versatile}} separation method for polymers for many years. Analysis of different polymers by HPLC is typically done by utilizing the differential solubility of the polymers by mixing a good solvent and an anti-solvent in various compositions. This method is called Gradient Polymer Elution Chromatography (GPEC). While GPEC has been used extensively, it commonly uses a <b>linear</b> <b>gradient</b> to separate components. Linear solvent gradients consume a lot of solvent and take a relatively long time (3 ̆e 30 minutes) to complete. The goal {{of this study is}} to develop a step gradient from a <b>linear</b> <b>gradient</b> in order to allow quick separation while retaining high resolution of the individual polymers. In this study, 6 different polymers are dissolved separately in a strong solvent. The polymers are then analyzed using a <b>linear</b> <b>gradient.</b> Using the results from the <b>linear</b> <b>gradient,</b> a step gradient is constructed and a known mixture of the pure polymers is analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the step gradient. Two strong solvents and four anti-solvents were used to test the generality of the results. It was found that the step gradient could achieve the same resolution of polymers as the <b>linear</b> <b>gradient,</b> but with as little as half the solvent in some cases. This analytical method of changing a <b>linear</b> <b>gradient</b> into a step gradient can reduce both analysis time and solvent requirement to achieve the desired separation of polymers...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} comparing {{the properties of}} 45 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M 33 and the atomic hydrogen (HI) {{with which they are}} associated. High-resolution VLA observations are used to measure the properties of HI in the vicinity of GMCs and in regions where GMCs have not been detected. The majority of molecular clouds coincide with a local peak in the surface density of atomic gas, though 7 % of GMCs in the sample are not associated with high-surface density atomic gas. The mean HI surface density in the vicinity of GMCs is 10 M_sol/pc^ 2 and tends to increase with GMC mass as Sigma_HI ~ M_GMC^ 0. 27. 39 of the 45 HI regions surrounding GMCs have <b>linear</b> velocity <b>gradients</b> of ~ 0. 05 km/s/pc. If the <b>linear</b> <b>gradients</b> previously observed in the GMCs result from rotation, then 53 % are counterrotating with respect to the local HI. If the <b>linear</b> <b>gradients</b> in these local HI regions are also from rotation, 62 % are counterrotating with respect to the galaxy. If magnetic braking reduced the angular momentum of GMCs early in their evolution, the angular velocity of GMCs would be roughly one order of magnitude lower than what is observed. Based on our observations, we consider the possibility that GMCs may not be rotating. Atomic gas not associated with GMCs has gradients closer to 0. 03 km/s/pc, suggesting that events occur during the course of GMC evolution that may increase the shear in the atomic gas.
