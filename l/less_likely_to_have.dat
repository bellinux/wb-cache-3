5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it {{was believed to be}} a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E

40|$|Sexual regret was {{investigated}} across two disparate cultures: Norway (N = 853), a highly secular and sexually liberal culture, and the United States (N = 466), a more religious and more sexually conservative culture. Sex differences, {{individual differences in}} preferred mating strategy, religiosity, and cultural differences in sexual regret were analyzed. Men were significantly <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> regret <b>having</b> had casual sex than women and were significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> regret passing up casual sexual opportunities than women. Participants who were more religious regretted having had casual sex more and regretted passing up casual sex less.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Patient-physician race/ethnicity {{concordance}} {{can improve}} care for minority patients. However, {{its effect on}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) care and prevention is unknown. We examined associations of patient race/ethnicity and patient-physician race/ethnicity concordance on CVD risk factor levels and appropriate modification of treatment in response to high risk factor values (treatment intensification) in a large cohort of diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The study population included 108, 555 adult diabetic patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2005. Probit models assessed the effect of patient race/ethnicity on risk factor control and treatment intensification after adjusting for patient and physician-level characteristics. RESULTS — African American patients were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than whites <b>to</b> <b>have</b> A 1 C � 8. 0 % (64 vs. 69 %, P � 0. 0001), LDL cholesterol � 100 mg/dl (40 vs. 47 %, P � 0. 0001), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) � 140 mmHg (70 vs. 78 %, P � 0. 0001).

25|$|Another {{cross-country}} study compared {{access to care}} based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S. Findings showed that in both countries, immigrants had worse access to care than non-immigrants.

In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care {{than those in the}} U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} psychological characteristics as risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), {{as well as the}} reflux-mediated precursor pathway. METHODS: An all-Ireland population-based case-control study recruited 230 reflux oesophagitis (RO), 224 Barrett&#x 2019;s oesophagus (BO) and 227 OAC patients and 260 controls. Each case/control group completed measures of stress, depression, self-efficacy, self-esteem, repression and social support. A comparative analysis was undertaken using polytomous logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared to controls, OAC patients were almost half as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report high stress levels over their lifetime (P = 0. 010, OR 0. 51; 95 %CI: 0. 29 - 0. 90) and 36 % <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> experienced depression (OR 0. 64; 95 %CI: 0. 42 - 0. 98). RO patients reported significantly higher stress than controls particularly during middle- and senior-years (P for trends < 0. 001). RO patients were 37 % <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> been highly emotionally repressed (OR 0. 63; 95 %CI: 0. 41 - 0. 95). All case groups (OAC, RO and BO) were more <b>likely</b> than controls <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> had substantial amounts of social support (OR 2. 84; 95 %CI: 1. 63 - 4. 97; OR 1. 97; 95 %CI: 1. 13 - 3. 44 and OR 1. 83; 95 %CI: 1. 03 - 3. 24, respectively).

To determine the proportion of CRC patients presenting with bleeding-related symptoms, to compare bleeders and nonbleeders and to explore the role of anticoagulants in bleeders. This was a nationwide, population-based, retrospective study, investigating all patients diagnosed with CRC in Iceland from 2008 to 2011. Bleeding-related symptoms were defined as overt bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia or a positive faecal occult blood test. Obstructive symptoms were defined as a confirmed diagnosis of ileus or dilated intestines on imaging. Data were available for 472 / 496 (95 %) patients, males 51 %, mean age 69 (± 13) years. In all, 348 (74 %) patients had bleeding-related symptoms; of these 348 patients, 61 % had overt bleeding. Bleeders were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than nonbleeders <b>to</b> <b>have</b> metastases at diagnosis, 19 % vs. 34 % (P <  0. 001). Overt bleeders were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than nonbleeders <b>to</b> <b>have</b> obstructive symptoms, 2 % vs. 16 % respectively (P <  0. 0001).
