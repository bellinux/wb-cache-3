Roger Ebert gave The Rainmaker three stars out of four, remarking: [...] "I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected.

Understandings of assessment theory by pre-service teachers through to more experienced teachers, and opportunities for all to critically reflect and consider their judgements of student work, are vital.

This research is part of the Digital Songlines Project which is developing protocols, methodologies and a toolkit to facilitate the collection and sharing of Indigenous cultural heritage knowledge, using virtual reality. Within the context of this project most of the cultural activities relate to celebrating life and to the Australian Aboriginal people, land is the heart of life. Australian Indigenous art, stories, dances, songs and rituals celebrate country as its focus or basis. To the Aboriginal people the term “Country” means a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> place or a nation, rather “Country” is a living entity with a past a present and a future; they talk about it {{in the same way as}} they talk about their mother.

40|$|Migrating is a life-changing {{decision}} that academics might take because of career. But leaving a homeland is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> job issue. Many other factors and adjustment challenges {{are put in}} the line. This book tells the stories of a selected group of geographers who migrated to one side to another of the Canada-US border. The often emotional autobiographical testimonials of those academics {{go a long way}} toward capturing the full range of feelings and experiences related to migration and settlement decision-making, especially as personal processes play out within the larger context of North American mobility. Common themes, issues, and questions emerge from their texts: the push-pull factors influencing their migration decision-making; the role of the department or university’s reputation in their decision to relocate abroad; the potential attraction of the physical/environmental characteristics of their new site of residence; the career or personal impacts of relocation; their attachment to place, sense of belonging, or feelings of “otherness” after relocation; and other opportunities or challenges they may have faced living and teaching abroad. As these various authors remind us, becoming a migrant is about much more than finding the right job or ending up in a particular locale. Mobility is also about seeking and finding pathways that lead to personal growth and a deepened trust in oneself and one’s family. ...|$|E

40|$|Does money {{make people}} happy? The {{authors of the}} book un-der review pose this old but still popular question. They address it by {{choosing}} a quite unusual but from another perspective obvious stand: to study the lives of lottery-winning millionaires. For many people, a lottery win is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> ticket to economic independence. Conventional wisdom treats it rather as a symbol for unique happiness, as it stands as a synonym for the fulfilment of almost all dreams. It {{is also one of}} the basic axiomatic assumptions in classical and neoclassical economics that increasing wealth causes increased happiness. The crucial question of the book is whether this holds true. Do lottery win-ners really feel happier after hitting the jackpot? Furthermore, how do they function after such an extraordinary, status-boost-ing event? In the first chapter, Christoph Lau and Ludwig Kramer ini-tially provide the reader with a brief historical overview about the emergence of games of chance with a special focus on lotter-ies. One finds out for instance that the first known lottery in the modern sense took place in the Dutch county Flanders in 1445. In the next chapter, the authors consider the gaming behaviour of lottery players. The essential issue here concerns the questions of who plays these games and why do people play these games. We are, for example, informed that lotteries are very popular in most countries, and about 40 % of the adult population in Germany play the classical lottery ‘‘ 6 from 49 ’ ’ at least once...|$|E
