Coal resource calculation is done to {{determine the amount of}} existing coal resource in region Muara Wahau, East Kalimantan. Research in PT. Bumi Murau Coal aims to identify the coal spreading pattern based on geophysical log data and bore log; and also know about the amount of existing coal resource in research area, especially Seam Z. The research methods of this final project are survey method, descriptive method and extended with analyze method. Analyze method was done by several steps. The first steps is correlation construction between bore hole to determine subsurface lithology sequence also coal spreading and step of coal bed map construction. Continued with quantitative analyze method that is calculation of coal Seam Z resource by using the combination grid method and Circular USGS method. There are 16 bore holes in research area, divided to 5 drilling lines. Seam Z is not found at 2 bore holes. Seam Z has thickness about 23 – 37 meters. The pattern of coal Seam Z thickness is thicker to southwest side. The depth of Seam Z is about 18 – 77 meters above sea <b>level.</b> <b>Seam</b> Z is occurred in almost of entire research area that spreads from southeast to northwest well continuously. Based on the class of resource according to USGS classification, Seam Z in research area can be divided in 2 class, measured coal that has distance of circular radius 0 – 400 meters and indicated coal that has distance of circular radius 400 – 1200 meters. Whereas the amount of Seam Z resource that has been calculated by Circular USGS method, measured coal in the amount of 193. 556. 553, 77 ton and indicated coal in the amount of 130. 216. 320, 5 ton. ...|$|E

40|$|The tomato is an {{important}} crop worldwide, {{and in recent years}} it has received great attention due to its rich content of carotenoids, which in studies indicate to have health benefiting properties. Many studies have been done in this area of research and in how to optimize the carotenoid content in tomatoes and tomato products. The objectives of this essay were to summarize present data in this field. The results were as follows: There are nine different carotenoids identified in tomatoes. Lycopene and β-carotene are the ones that have been given the greatest attention. Lycopene is the carotenoid that seems to have the strongest effect in preventing cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The composition of tomatoes, in regard to carotenoids, is affectable by light, radiation, temperature and harvest, as is storage, geography and climate. It is possible to modify the bioavailability by different kinds of processing. Lycopene and lutein absorbance benefits from heating while β-carotene <b>levels</b> <b>seams</b> to decrease.

The difficulties associated with accurate predictions {{of the interaction between}} sewing parameters and fabrics properties. Traditional approach of matching variety of sewing parameters with unlimited fabric properties through personal experience has been a challenge in the apparel industry which increased the cost of production due to reprocess or rejection. Hence, in the present study, an alternative mathematical modeling known as Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was proposed to predict the seam puckering grading together with the usage of high end instrumentation for fabric known as Kawabata Evaluation System (KES-F). The KES-F determined 16 parameters related to handle properties of a fabric and SEM produced prediction equation based on a few selected important parameters. The results show that equation by SEM can be used to predict the <b>level</b> of <b>seam</b> puckering of different categories of fabric weights. Good comparisons with the experimental and previous studies demonstrate the ability of the model {{to be used as a}} predictive tool for textile materials particularly for seam puckering...|$|R

40|$|Gravitational {{rules are}} {{used as the basis}} for the {{prognosis}} of vertical stress distribution in exploited rock masses. A decrease in stress in a worked-out area (decrease between the initial stress and the stress acting on the floor of the outmined seam) results in an increase in stress in the surrounding unworked area. The size of load in the floor of the worked-out area is determined by the degree of disturbance in the overlying strata rocks. An overall additional load in the surrounding rocks of the unworked area is determined based on the difference between the initial geostatic stress and the load in the floor of the worked-out area. The additional load, which is determined from the force of relieving the stress in the worked-out area divided by the periphery of the worked-out area, decreases per unit of length of the periphery of the worked-out area. Furthermore, the behaviour of stress in the direction of the worked-out area is calculated mathematically. In this way, the stress in the grid of points on the <b>level</b> of <b>seams</b> being mined can be calculated, and isolines of acting stress can be determined. As an example, we show calculations for a specific situation in a mine before rigid overlying strata failure and after the failure.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} into mine ventilation systems currently in use within Australian modern coal Longwall (LW) extraction mines. It reviews systems and discusses evolving changes being adopted to address the more complex challenges. There is a strong move to longer panels, wider faces, greater extraction heights, increased production rates, more efficient ventilation and decreased personnel. In addition mine workings are moving deeper which results in increased ventilation control issues such as higher total and respirable dust <b>levels,</b> greater <b>seam</b> gas contents in parallel with lower in situ permeabilities, spontaneous combustion and heat management issues. Currently {{there are a variety}} of LW panel ventilation circuits used in Australian underground coal mines due to various combinations of seam characteristics, gas emission rates, spontaneous combustion, geological features and surface constraints. The main issues usually addressed in the designing and planning of ventilation circuits for LW panels are airway velocity, gas concentrations, LW cutting methods (e. g. Bi-di, Uni-di or half web), ventilation of control devices, pressure differentials and leakage paths and understanding gas concentrations across the length and width of the goaf. If the ventilation circuit can manage the applied contaminant load (gases, heat and dust) at an acceptable cost and circuit duty, then supplementary controls, such as gas drainage, refrigeration and dust sprays and scrubbers, may not be required.

40|$|The {{results of}} fused {{multilayer}} systems pre-tension level upon biaxial loading {{are presented in}} this research work. The values of initial pre-tension of fused multilayer systems in longitudinal and transverse directions were: 0. 0  %, 0. 4  %, 0. 8  %, 1. 2  %, 1. 7  % and 2. 1  %. The results of the investigations have shown that deformational characteristics (F, N and H max, mm) in longitudinal and transverse directions differ {{with the increase of}} pre-tension <b>level.</b> Thus, <b>seam</b> allowances can be defined more accurately in more deformable direction at the stage of product development. Cotton fabric (100  %) of plain weave was used as base material for fused systems. Biaxial tension testing was performed with three types of interlinings: woven, nonwoven and knitted, which differed not only in surface density, but in the density of adhesive layer, which was 52 and 76 dots/cm 2, as well. The samples of fused systems were punched {{from the side of the}} main cotton fabric in order to maintain the same friction force between the punch and the specimen. Obtained results have shown that different number of force peaks, i. e. breakings is characteristic for different fused systems. For initial pre-tension from 0. 0  % to 2. 1  % the first breaking always appears in longitudinal direction irrespectfully to longitudinal or transverse pre-tension direction. It means that at low levels of pre-tension, e. g. 2. 1  % it is possible to control the height of punching deformation, but not to change the location of critical stresses. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid <b>level</b> indicator, <b>seams,</b> and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
30|$|The ACG {{approach}} {{relies on}} the availability of seismic source locations obtained from high quality, three-dimensional seismic monitoring systems. Such systems have been employed in some burst-prone European coalfields. In Czechoslovakia, for example, researchers have been able to study the relationship between the magnitude and location of seismic events and the extent of damage underground. In one instance, extensive damage resulted from a seismic magnitude (M) event, where M =  2.8, that was located more than 100  m away from the workings (Holub et al. 2011). On the other hand, even very large events may have little impact on the mine if they occur well above the workings. During one 5 -year period in Poland, there were 15 large mining-induced events with M ranging from 2.2 to 4.0 (Mutke and Stec 1997). Only 6 of these had any significant effect underground. <b>Seam</b> <b>level</b> “mining tremors”, on the other hand, are often too small to register on a regional seismic network, but they can result in serious injury if a miner is in the vicinity (Mutke and Stec 1997).|$|R
40|$|Fraunhofer IZFP in Dresden is {{developing}} technologies for monitoring major components of wind turbines operating off- and onshore. Different structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques {{have been developed}} for monitoring rotor blades by acoustic methods, drive trains by operational modal analysis and welding seams in the foundation of offshore wind turbines by guided ultrasonic waves. Rotor blade monitoring technologies have been realized and tested at full scale under fatigue loading on a ground test bed and on a rotating wind turbine. The SHM-based techniques were compared to results obtained from conventional NDT techniques such as ultrasonics and thermography where validations have been made at damage critical locations of the different components considered. After completion of the full scale test selected damage critical parts were cut out of the rotor blade to allow for further inspection based on X-ray tomography and microwave technology. Acoustic emission monitoring results performed on an SHM basis showed comparatively good correlation when compared to the results obtained by conventional NDT. Drive train monitoring was realized through operational modal analysis. Generated through the excitation of the rotating blades the drive train started to resonate in its eigenfrequencies resulting from the eigenfrequencies of the drive train components such as bearings and gears. These oscillations caused by the different eigenmodes had to be determined through clear separation. Monitoring of foundation structures is a dedicated issue in offshore applications. In the range between low and high water <b>levels</b> welding <b>seams</b> become specifically prone to corrosion and cracking. In such cases a guided wave based monitoring system turns out to be valuable. Such a system is based on piezoelectric transducer arrays where the acoustic beam can be focused on the welding seam.

The vitrinite maceral group composition of the investigated coal seams ranges from 62. 50 – 83. 15 %, whereas the inertinite content varies from 14. 93 – 36. 81 %. The liptinite content varies from 0. 66 % to 3. 09 %. The maximum micro-pores are confined within the vitrinite group of macerals. The coal seams exhibit vitrinite reflectance values (Ro % calculated) from 0. 94 % (sample CG- 97) to 1. 21 % (sample CG- 119). Proximate analyses of the investigated coal samples reveal that the moisture content (M%) ranges from 1. 28 % to 2. 98 %, whereas, volatile matter (VM%) content is placed in the range of 27. 01 % to 33. 86 %. The ash content (A%) ranges from 10. 92 % to 30. 01 %. Fixed carbon (FC%) content varies from 41. 53 % to 55. 93 %. Fuel ratio variation shows a restricted range from 1. 53 to 1. 97.

40|$|As part of {{the initial}} {{investigation}} and validation of a new boundary-element formulation for stress modeling in coal mines, the underground stresses and displacements at two multiple-seam coal mines with unique stress problems were modeled and predicted. The new program, LAMODEL, calculates stresses and displacements at the <b>seam</b> <b>level</b> and at requested locations in the overburden or at the surface. Both linear elastic and nonlinear seam materials can be used, and surface effects, multiple seams, and multiple mining steps can be simulated. In order to most efficiently use LAMODEL for accurate stress prediction, the program is first calibrated to the site-specific geomechanics based on previously observed stress conditions at the mine. For this calibration process, a previously mined area is "stress mapped" by quantifying the observed pillar and strata behavior using a numerical rating system. Then, the site-specific mechanical properties in the model are adjusted {{to provide the best}} correlation between the predicted stresses and the observed underground stress rating. Once calibrated, the model is then used to predict future stress problems ahead of mining.

40|$|Image-based object {{modeling}} {{has emerged}} as an important computer vision application. Typically, the process starts with the acquisition of the image views of an object. These views are registered within the global coordinate system using structure-and-motion techniques, while on the next step the geometric shape of an object is recovered using stereo and/or silhouette cues. This paper considers the final step, which creates the texture map for the recovered geometry model. The approach proposed in the paper naturally starts by backprojecting original views onto the obtained surface.

Finally, the residual seams between the mosaic components are removed via <b>seam</b> <b>levelling</b> procedure, which is similar to gradient-domain stitching techniques recently proposed for image editing. Unlike previous approaches to the same problem, intensity blending as well as image resampling are avoided on all stages of the process, which ensures that the resolution of the produced texture is essentially {{the same as that of}} the original views. Importantly, due to restriction to non-greedy energy optimization techniques, good results are produced even in the presence of significant errors on image registration and geometric estimation steps. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Act of Parliament {{allowing}} {{the building of}} the Bridgewater Canal was passed in 1759. The construction of the canal had already started when James Brindley became involved. Brindley took charge of the canal's construction. Several changes were made to the canal's course under Brindley's control and the canal was completed in 1764. Before and during the construction of the Bridgewater Canal the navigable level was begun and tunnelling progressed. A tunnel 8 ft high was cut northwards into the rock from the canal level at Worsley providing 4 ft of headroom and 4 ft of water. The first workable seam (the Worsley Four Foot mine) was reached in 1761, 770 yd from the tunnel's portal. The tunnel was not straight; it changed course in order to avoid trespassing under the land of neighbouring landlords. As new coal seams were intercepted branch <b>levels</b> into the <b>seams</b> were dug and extended as the coals were mined. The branch level along the Four Feet seam itself reached a length of 1.75 mi. Mine shafts were sunk and coal mined ahead of the intended line of the main navigable level, which was continually lengthened for many years reaching a length of 4 mi. In order to ease the congestion resulting from the large number of boats using the level a second entrance tunnel was dug, 500 yd long, and a one-way system introduced.|$|R
40|$|This practice-led {{research}} {{examines the}} paradox of seamlessness in fashion, drawing on the similarities found between {{the process of making}} garments, the process of their embodiment and process of research. Integrating practical and theoretical methods, it suggests that the process of making and using garments can be a transitional experience, as well as a device that creates ambiguity of subjectivity, which in turn promotes the subject’s reflexive re-adjustment. This analysis informed and was informed by making a series of seamless woven garments which reveal their own construction, showing themselves to be forms in process, representing the ambiguity of modern subjects. Inconsistency and contradiction are intrinsic to fashion: it is both matter and meaning, both cover and display, both imitation and differentiation, but it is always difficult to locate clear demarcation. As a garment-maker, I metaphorically placed this ambiguity at the material <b>level</b> of <b>seams,</b> openings and edges of garments, from which emerged the research question: What is the meaning and function of the seam and seamlessness? My investigation through making garments via hand-woven seaming methods, and my search for an adequate theoretical rendering of the reflections arising from the making, led me beyond the discipline of fashion, to the fields of psychoanalysis, anthropology, sociology and art, literary and cultural theory, from which a series of perspectives are derived. Articulated in this thesis and the accompanying exhibition are thus the process and result of my explorations through making, writing, and theory. The making process involving contact with material is a displacing experience that generates a reflexive value. This demonstrates the ability of garments to test and reset the essential boundary of corporeal subjectivity through the experience of both illusion and reality. Dressing practice is thus the making of the self via repeated reality testing. The poetic function of making thus enables us to generate an authentic knowledge from the experience of oscillating between disparate states. Therefore, together, the seam and seamlessness represent the subject-in-process, and fashion as a particular way of being in this transitional passage. The estranging effect of my hand-woven seams demonstrate this poetic function of making. In the same way, the thesis reveals the seams between practice and theory, and between diverse references, but also their mutually informing relationship...|$|R
40|$|Examples of {{subsidence}} {{monitoring of}} multi-seam mining in Australian conditions are relatively limited {{compared to the}} extensive database of monitoring from single seam mining. The subsidence monitoring data now available from the mining of longwall panels in two seams at the Ashton Underground Mine (Ashton) provides an opportunity to significantly advance the understanding of subsidence behaviour in response to multi-seam mining in a regular offset geometry. This paper presents an analysis and interpretation of the multi-seam subsidence monitoring data from the first five panels in the second seam at the Ashton Underground Mine. The methods used to estimate subsidence effects for the planned third seam of mining are also presented. Observations {{of the characteristics of}} multi-seam subsidence indicate that although more complex than single seam mining, the subsidence movements are regular and reasonably predictable. Movements are constrained within the general footprint of the active panel. They are however sensitive to the relative panel geometries in each seam and to the direction of mining. In an offset geometry, tilt and strain levels are observed to remain at single <b>seam</b> <b>levels</b> despite the greater vertical displacement. At stacked goaf edges tilt and strain levels are up to four times greater. Latent subsidence recovered from the overlying seam has been identified as a key contributor to the subsidence outcomes.

50|$|The largest {{change to}} {{industrial}} Glamorgan was the opening {{up of the}} South Wales coalfield, the largest continuous coalfield in Britain, which occupied {{the greater part of}} Glamorgan, mostly north of the Vale. The coalfield provided a vast range in quality and type, but prior to 1750 the only real access to the seams was through bell pits or digging horizontally into a <b>level</b> where the <b>seam</b> was exposed at a river bank or mountainside. Although initially excavated for export, coal was soon also needed for the smelting process in Britain's expanding metallurgical industries. Developments in coal mining began in the north-eastern rim of Glamorgan around the ironworks of Merthyr and in the south-west around the copper plants of Swansea. In 1828 the South Wales coalfield was producing an estimated 3 million tons of coal, by 1840 that had risen to 4.5 million, with about 70 percent consumed by local commercial and domestic usage.The 1840s saw the start of a dramatic increase in the amount of coal excavated within Glamorgan. Several events took place to precipitate the growth in coal mining, including the discovery of steam coal in the Cynon Valley, the building of a large masonry dock at Cardiff and the construction of the Taff Vale Railway. In 1845, after trials by the British Admiralty, Welsh steam coal replaced coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne as the preferred fuel for the ships of the Royal Navy. Glamorgan steam coal quickly became a sought-after commodity for navies {{all over the world and}} its production increased to meet the demand.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of clean, affordable energy {{is essential for}} the prosperity and security of the United States and the world in the 21 st century. Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions to the atmosphere are an inherent part of energy-related activities, such as electricity generation, transportation, and building systems. These energy-related activities are responsible for roughly 85 % of the U. S. greenhouse gas emissions, and 95 % of these emissions are dominated by CO{sub 2 }. Over the last few decades, an increased concentration of CO{sub 2 } in the earth's atmosphere has been observed. Many scientists believe greenhouse gases, particularly CO{sub 2 }, trap heat in the earth's atmosphere. Carbon sequestration technology offers an approach to redirect CO{sub 2 } emissions into sinks (e. g., geologic formations, oceans, soils, and vegetation) and potentially stabilize future atmospheric CO{sub 2 } <b>levels.</b> Coal <b>seams</b> are attractive CO{sub 2 } sequestration sinks, due to their abundance and proximity to electricity-generation facilities. The recovery of marketable coal bed methane (CBM) provides a value-added stream, reducing the cost to sequester CO{sub 2 } gas. Much research is needed to evaluate this technology in terms of CO{sub 2 } storage capacity, sequestration stability, commercial feasibility and overall economics. CONSOL Energy, with support from the U. S. DOE, is conducting a seven-year program to construct and operate a coal bed sequestration site composed of a series of horizontally drilled wells that originate at the surface and extend through overlying coal seams in the subsurface. Once completed, the wells will be used to initially drain CBM from both the upper (mineable) and lower (unmineable) coal seams. After sufficient depletion of the reservoir, centrally located wells in the lower coal seam will be converted from CBM drainage wells to CO{sub 2 } injection ports. CO{sub 2 } will be measured and injected into the lower unmineable coal seam while CBM continues to drain from both seams. In addition to metering all injected CO{sub 2 } and CBM produced, the program includes a plan to monitor horizontal migration of CO{sub 2 } within the lower seam. This is the second Technical Progress report for the project. Progress to date has been focused on pre-construction activities; in particular, attaining site approvals and securing property rights for the project.

The subdivisions of the coal measures include the Burngrove Formation, Middle Main Seam and Fair Hill Formation in the northern Bowen Basin. To {{the south of the}} basin, the Middle Main Seam is interpreted as the stratigraphic equivalent of Black Alley Shale Formation. The Yarrabee Tuff forms the top boundary of the coal measures and is distributed basin-wide except over the southern Denison and southern Taroom troughs. Accessory tuffs beneath the Yarrabee Tuff aided <b>seam</b> <b>level</b> correlation. The geometries of coal seams have been analysed for each morphotectonic zone of the Bowen Basin using gravity data, which highlight high and low topographic sites. The Collinsville Shelf in northwest of the Bowen Basin comprises thick and merged Burngrove and Fair Hill formation coals that split towards northeast in the Nebo Synclinorium and southeast in Taroom Trough. Coal seams split into daughter seams from north to south and are named as first, second or third order, {{based on the number of}} splits that occurred. First- and second-order splitting occurs at the boundary of the Nebo Synclinorium and Collinsville Shelf, at the Narrows of Nebo Synclinorium and Comet Ridge. Further, third- and fourth-order splitting occurs at the boundary of the Comet Ridge and Taroom Trough. Splitting zones found at the junction of morphotectonic zones are related to a change in subsidence. In addition, the association of split seams with coarse grain-dominated interburden reflects increased accommodation in low-lying areas such as the Nebo Synclinorium and the troughs. Thick and coalesced coal seams are associated with shelves and ridges of the basin reflecting low accommodation sites. Hence, the variation in the coal seam architecture of FCCM responds to the subsidence associated with different morphotectonic zones of the basin...|$|R

Except coal pits dug for mining, the area isvegetated, and only scattered outcrops occur along the rivers making it difficult to establish acomplete facies succession; however some sections are good enough to provide new valuableinformation regarding this key African units which can be combined with existing published datato provide an overview of the whole series. First, at the base of the Karoo succession and overlying the basement superimposedconglomerates and sandy deposits belonging to the Vúzi Fm. occur. They are time equivalent ofSouth Africa Dwyka tillites. Numerous upward fining cycles are recognized grading fromconglomerates to silts and shales. The lower cycle, including striated and faceted pebbles is mostlikely to be basal tillites of the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation; the overlying cycles includeimbricated clasts conglomerates grading to sandy turbidites and silts, with imbricated clasts aswell as gravel bars suggesting a subaerial origin of the conglomerates, possibly deposited in a proglacialsetting, grading to shallow lake. The next sequences shows matrix supportedconglomerates interpreted as debris flows interbedded with sandy turbidites suggesting a lakedeepening. On top of the succession, permanent lake conditions occur, with conglomerates debrisflows but occurrence of stromatolites suggest a lake warming related to the final stage of the iceretreat. The overlying Moatize Fm includes 6 main coal seams belonging to 5 depositionalsequences. About half of the coal beds appear to be time transgressive whilst the rest are developedon top of the most regressive part of deltaic sequences. These later are often thinner and are partlyeroded by fluvial channels of the overlying depositional sequence. Most of the coals beds seem tobe deltaic swampy coal, however the lowermost <b>level</b> Sousa Pinto <b>Seam</b> which is seated at thebase of a lacustrine series could have a slightly deeper origin even if it is also time transgressive. As in other lacustrine series, when the lake dried out, deep fluvial incision occurs leadingto develop sequences juxtaposition rather than superimposition. A spectacular example of suchrelationships occurs between Upper Chipanga and Lower Banareinas seams. The ultimate André Seam is eroded by the base of a thick fluvial channel belonging to thebase of Matinde Fm. Within Matinde Fm, thick fluvial units including meandering channelsalternate with lacustrine shales and wave dominated sandy deposits, but again outcrops arediscontinuous making difficult to have a complete overview of this unit. In conclusion, some good sections of the Lower Karoo Supergroup have been analyzeddemonstrating a wide range of fluvio-lacustrine environments...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{assisted}} {{cold cracking}} (HACC) represents a significant {{threat to the}} integrity of welded steel constructions. HACC occurs at near ambient or lower temperatures and may be delayed for several hours, or even days, after welding is completed. Significant advances in developing thermomechanically controlled processed steels, with reduced carbon and alloy content, resulted in steels that are more resistant to HACC in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This has enabled the use of lower preheat temperatures during fabrication of welded structures. However, the improvement in the resistance of the HAZ to HACC has shifted the problem of cold cracking to the weld metal. The objective of this current work was to establish the effect of flux cored arc welding(FCAW) welding parameters, such as welding current, contact-tip toworkpiece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type, on diffusible hydrogen (HD) content for single run, bead-onplate welds using low strength seamed and seamless gas shielded rutile wires of E 71 T- 1 classification. The work has shown that under most conditions investigated, the weld metal HD <b>levels</b> for the <b>seamed</b> rutile wire were above the 10 ml/ 100 g specified by the consumable’s classification (H 10). The measured range of diffusible hydrogen for the H 10 wire was 8. 3 to 17. 0 ml/ 100 g, with the highest hydrogen content being obtained at the lowest welding current of 280 A, shortest CTWD of 15 mm and deposited using 75 Ar- 25 CO 2 shielding gas. In contrast, the seamless wire met requirements of the H 5 classification (HD ≤ 5 ml/ 100 g) for all welding conditions investigated, with a range of HD levels of 0. 9 to 3. 5 ml/ 100 g. In general, lower HD levels were achieved when using CO 2 shielding gas, although the effect is less significant with the H 5 seamless rutile wire. The work included an investigation of arc characteristics under typical welding conditions, using high speed digital imaging and laser backlighting, in order to provide information on metal transfer and arc length. Several tests were carried out using the H 10 consumable. It was established that the amount of heat generated by resistive heating of the wire prior to melting can exert a strong influence on the weld metal HD content and is more pronounced in welds deposited using 75 Ar- 25 CO 2. The measured arc length was reduced significantly when welding under CO 2 shielding gas. Despite suggestions in the literature {{there was no evidence of}} a change in metal transfer mode to spray transfer on increasing the welding current from 280 to 320 A, transfer mode was globular for all conditions used. Following the weld metal diffusible hydrogen testing and welding arc imaging work, the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking was assessed using the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test at different preheat temperatures. For this part of the work, identical welding parameters those used for the diffusible hydrogen testing were selected. It was found that the H 5 wire weld deposits did not reveal any cracking at ambient temperature, whereas all the welds deposited using the H 10 wire exhibited cold cracking with no preheat. Weld metal deposited using 75 Ar- 25 CO 2 shielding gas resulted in higher susceptibility to cold cracking than with CO 2, which correlated to lower HD levels the CO 2 tests. Besides the higher hydrogen content, it was also found that higher weld metal hardness corresponded to the greater crack susceptibility in the welds deposited using 75 Ar- 25 CO 2 shielding gas. These factors are considered to contribute to higher susceptibility to transverse cold cracking compared with CO 2 shielding gas. Although the overall results indicate that the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking corresponds to the relevant levels of HD, this relationship was found to be ambiguous in welds deposited at the shortest CTWD of 15 mm, using CO 2 shielding gas at all welding currents investigated. While the amount of diffusible hydrogen was marginally increased from 11. 7 to 12. 8 ml/ 100 g, resulting from the welding current increase from 280 to 320 A, the amount of cold cracking at room temperature was significantly decreased from 89 to 25 %RTC. This is explained by a significant difference in the cross section of the weld beads, suggesting a need to more closely evaluate the G-BOP testing, particularly examining the effects of weld bead profiles on the weld susceptibility to HACC. Preheat was found to decrease the amount of cold cracking in the H 10 welds and it was concluded that preheat significantly reduces the main contributor to decrease the HD in the weld metal. Although the cracking susceptibility of welds using 75 Ar- 25 CO 2 shielding gas decreased more slowly with an increasing preheat temperature, compare to those deposited using CO 2, no cracking was observed at 120 °C in welds under both shielding gases. This indicates that the same welding consumable (H 10) deposited using different shielding gases can result in a different response to preheat temperature. Based on the results of this work, a number of changes are proposed to hydrogen testing standards AS 3752 - 1996 and ISO 3690 - 2000, particularly with respect to the effects of CTWD and shielding gases on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux-cored wire...|$|R
