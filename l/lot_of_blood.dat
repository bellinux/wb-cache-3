[...] However, a different reason was given by the Armenians' most successful commander of the conflict, Monte Melkonian. [...] According to Melkonian, the commander of the southern front in Martuni (Khojavend), the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice.

It would be nice if the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's yours, and that's that."

A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade.

It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!"

Facing {{a choice of}} whether to rejoin the University of Denver, or to join the Oilers, Anderson chose the latter. [...] Making his professional debut with the Oilers, Anderson recorded 30 goals, 23 assists, and 53 points in 58 games in his first season. The Oilers made the playoffs that year and defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the preliminary round, three games to none. This was deemed a huge upset since the Canadiens had finished eleven spots higher than the Oilers in the overall standings. The Oilers {{moved on to the}} quarter-finals where they were defeated in six games by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, New York Islanders. During the playoff run, Anderson scored 12 points in 9 games, establishing himself as a [...] "fierce" [...] playoff performer. Anderson's sophomore season saw him record career highs in both assists and points with 67 and 105, respectively. His team jumped from fourth place to first place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Oilers were the victims of one of the biggest upsets in hockey history. Facing the Los Angeles Kings, a team they had finished 48 points ahead in the regular season, the Oilers were defeated in five games stemming from a lack of calling a high sticking penalty which drew a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> by the Great one, Wayne Gretzky.|$|E

Janssen said that at first the initial appeal was just money, but she quickly took a liking of the script and of Wirkola personally. She also thought the idea of playing an [...] "evil to the core" [...] witch [...] "was appealing and different", saying, [...] "I hadn't done anything like it…A character like a witch feels like you would have so much freedom, because there are no restrictions as to what you can do." [...] Later, however, she was constantly being distracted by the special effects work and felt that she [...] "really understood the character" [...] only {{in one part of the}} film. She found the time-consuming process of applying such makeup (taking three hours to apply and one hour to remove) [...] "very strange" [...] and also felt restricted and afraid of acting over-the-top in her witch role.

[...] Janssen said the film might appeal to women and girls, too: [...] "There's a brother and a sister story. And there's a romance in it too - but obviously not with the witch.

5000|$|Heroic bloodshed is a {{genre of}} Hong Kong action cinema {{revolving}} around stylized action sequences and dramatic themes such as brotherhood, duty, honour, redemption and violence.

2500|$|He {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "One Man Army".

After taking out the emplacements, he was knocked to the ground twice by exploding enemy grenades. Nevertheless, {{he got up and}} attacked three more times, each time destroying an enemy emplacement until he was wounded. On October 19, 2002, during a ceremony honoring the 65th Infantry, when he was asked about the battle, Cartagena responded that he just hurled back at the Chinese the grenades thrown at him.

Cartagena, who had lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> was sent to Taibu in a helicopter and then to Japan to the 128th Marines Hospital where he was hospitalized for 62 days.

2500|$|During this period, he {{is known}} to have resorted to extreme {{measures}} of sense control which involve self-abnegation methods like fasting for months together (having just a cup of tea a day) while taking huge quantities of food at other times.

He did not allow very many people in his room during this period. Whole room and his bed used to be covered with a lot of dust and one could find cobwebs and spiders around the room but he wouldn't bother cleaning it or let anyone else clean it. A rat is said to have nibbled a hole into one of his heels during this time though he {{is said to have been}} oblivious to its pain. His only constant companion in the room besides the burning lamp was his pipe. During this time he would take intoxicants like opium and sometimes vomit a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> His whole body had swollen and had become weak. On one occasion his sister reminded him of the financial difficulties they were going through but he is said to have responded by saying (translated here into English) [...] "our boat is in the middle of ocean right now, either we would reach ashore safe or drown". Some religious writers think he might have practised some form of tantric spiritual practice like pranabhasya during this time. After seven such years of his spiritual practice, his devotees affirm that he had become, what they call in Hinduism, a siddha purusha (one who attains spiritual powers) as it was right after this period that people started flocking him to get their worldly problems solved.|$|E
