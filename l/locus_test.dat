50|$|Bill Russell (1951) {{created a}} {{landmark}} {{in the field}} of mouse genetics by creating a specifically designed mouse strain, the T (test) stock that was used in genetic screens for testing mutagens such as radiations and chemicals. The T-stock mouse harbors 7 recessive, viable mutations affecting easily recognizable traits. At the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Russell's initial goal was to determine the rate of inheritable gene mutations in the germ line induced by radiations. Thus he decided to use T-stock mice in order to define how often a set of loci could be mutated with radiations. Since the mutations in the T-stock mouse were recessive, the progeny would have a wild type phenotype (as a result of crossing a mutant mutant male to a wild type female +/+). Thus with any progeny carrying a mutation induced by radiation at one of the 7 loci, would exhibit the mutant phenotype in the first generation itself. This approach, the specific <b>locus</b> <b>test</b> (SLT) allowed Russell to study a wide range of specific mutations and to calculate the mutation rates induced by radiations.|$|E

40|$|Eighteen {{variants}} {{recovered from}} specific locus mutation rate experiments involving the mutagen chlorambucil {{were subjected to}} several genetic and molecular analyses. Most mutations {{were found to be}} homozygous lethal. Because lethality is often presumptive evidence for multilocus-deletion events, 10 mutations were analyzed by Southern blot analysis with probes at, or closely linked to, several of the specific <b>locus</b> <b>test</b> markers, namely, albino (c), brown (b), and dilute (d). All eight mutations (two c; three b; two d; and one dilute-short ear [Df(d se) ]) that arose in post-spermatogonial germ cells were deleted for DNA sequences. No evidence for deletion of two d-se region probes was obtained for the remaining two d mutations that arose in stem-cell spermatogonia. Six of the primary mutants also produced low litter sizes ("semisterility"). Karyotypic analysis has, to date, confirmed the presence of reciprocal translocations in four of the six. The high frequency of deletions and translocations among the mutations induced in post-spermatogonial stages by chlorambucil, combined with its overall high efficiency in inducing mutations in these stages, should make chlorambucil mutagenesis useful for generating experimentally valuable germ-line deletions throughout the mouse genome...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{mutation}} spectra {{induced by}} iV-ethyl-A'-nitrosou-rea {{have been obtained}} in several organisms and test systems, frequently showing different results. In Drosophila melanogaster this spectrum has been analyzed in post-meiotic stages, resulting in good agreement between the adduct spectrum and mutational events, the majority being GC-»AT transitions (61 %). However, when collecting data about in vivo ENU-induced mutations in mouse germ cell stages mostly damage at A:T sites (89 %) was observed. In this work we analyze the molecular spectrum induced with ENU in pre-meiotic repair-active male germ cells of D. melanogaster, using the specific <b>locus</b> <b>test</b> (SLT) with the vermilion locus as target Results show that the most mutagenic sites in spermatogonial stem cells of Drosophila are A:T pairs (85 %), with AT->TA transversions (50 %) and AT—»GC transitions (35 %) as the most frequent mutations. Differences from the post-meiotic spectrum {{may be explained by}} the active repair of some adducts, such as (^-ethylguanine and /V-alkyl-induced abasic sites. In addition, these results show the relevance of the minor lesions O^-ethylthymine and 6 ^-ethylthymine in the produc-tion of mutations, as a consequence of their poor repair. Finally, since there is a striking similarity to the ENU-induced mutation spectrum in mouse, these results reveal that Drosophila continues to be an excellent model system...|$|E

In this work we pro-duced a didactical material about Monera kingdom to allow the knowledge accessibility by all students including those with blindness or visual impairments.

In this study, we analysed {{the involvement of the}} HLA region in susceptibility for SLE in a stable founder, Caucasian population of SLE patients. Methods: We performed an extensive screen of the entire HLA region on 103 SLE patients and family-based controls. Both single locus association analysis and haplotype sharing analysis were performed. The Additional Disease <b>Locus</b> <b>Test</b> (ADLT) was applied to examine the nature of the observed associations and to distinguish true causal associations from associations due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results: Significant associations were observed at markers in the HLA class I, class II, and class III regions using both haplotype sharing and single locus methods. The haplotype sharing methods revealed the most significant difference at marker D 6 S 1666 in the HLA class II region (p(HSS) = 0. 00037, p(CROSS) = 1. 7 x 10 (- 5)). The most significant result for single locus association was shown at marker D 6 S 265 in the HLA class I region (p = 0. 00019). The ADLT demonstrated that these markers represent independent associations.

40|$|Germ cell {{mutagenesis}} was {{studied in}} male λlacZ transgenic mice {{in such a}} way that the data can be compared with literature data for germ cell mutagenesis obtained with the specific-locus test. This comparison is of interest for validation of the transgenic mouse model. We studied mutagenesis induced by ethylnitrosourea (ENU) in mature spermatozoa isolated from epididymis and vas deferens. In order to investigate mutagenesis in different phases of spermatogenesis, animals were killed at various time points after treatment. After an ENU dose of 150 mg/kg, an increase of the mutant frequency (MF) occurred only in stem cells (9 -fold; 100 days post-treatment) but not in post-stem cells (0. 1 and 7 days post-treatment). Specific <b>locus</b> <b>test</b> data from literature showed a larger induction of mutations in stem cells (44 -fold; > 42 days post-treatment). Although spermatogenesis in mice normally takes ~ 42 days, we found only a limited increase of the MF at 50 days post-treatment. This may be due to a delay of spermatogenesis, which was confirmed by the observation that O 6 -ethylguanine levels in spermatozoan DNA remained approximately the same between 0. 1 and 50 days and were reduced to background levels at 100 days. Dose-response studies with the 3 ilacZ mice indicated a threshold for mutation induction in stem cells at low ENU dosages, which is in accordance with the specific-locus test data. In summary, our experiments suggest that 1 lacZ transgenic mice are a suitable model to study germ cell mutagenesis in spermatogonial stem cells...|$|E

A linear deletion map of the [Myodl, Ldh 31 - [Snrpn, Znf 127] region has been constructed from the molecular analyses of the plocus deletions. The utility of these deletions as tools for the isolation and characterization of the genes specifylng the neurological, reproductive, and developmental phenotypes genetically mapped to this region will grow as more detailed molecular analyses continue.

40|$|We {{currently}} know a {{great deal}} about the mouse genome, including sequence, genomic location and expression patterns for many genes. However, the function of individual genes is unknown in many cases. Understanding gene function is critical to assess a gene’s relationship to human health and disease. Forward genetic screens are a classic strategy to evaluate animals for phenotypes of interest and link a gene to a biological function. The piebald deletion complex is a set of overlapping chromosomal deficiencies on distal mouse chromosome 14 created during the specific <b>locus</b> <b>test.</b> We have surveyed the functional genetic content of the piebald deletion region in an essential gene mutagenesis screen of 952 genomes to recover seven lethal mutants. The screen uses the deletion resource and the spotted coat color of the piebald mouse to identify developmentally critical genes within an ~ 19 Mb interval of the distal region of mouse chromosome 14. The ENU-induced mutations were mapped to defined genetic intervals using the piebald deletion panel. Lethal mutations identified included a loss-of-function allele of Phr 1 resulting in respiratory distress at birth and a locus required for establishment of the left-right embryonic axis. We further characterized the ENU-induced mutation disrupting left-right patterning as an allele of Progesterone induced blocking factor 1 (Pibf 1) by positional cloning and the characterization of a second allele. We show that the phenotype of Pibf 1 -deficient embryos is consistent with disrupted Hedgehog signaling. We also find that PIBF 1 localizes to the ciliary axoneme and that loss of Pibf 1 disrupts the formation of both cilia and microvilli suggesting a role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Thus, our studies identify Pibf 1 as a gene important for cytoskeletal organization, ciliogenesis and signal transduction. A functional map of the piebald region integrates experimental genetic data from the deletion panel, mutagenesis screen, and the targeted disruption of specific genes. A comparison of several genomic intervals targeted in regional mutagenesis screens suggests that the piebald region is characterized by a low gene density and high essential gene density with a distinct genomic content and organization that supports complex regulatory interactions and promotes evolutionary stability...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{methods are}} {{described}} to detect clastogenic and aneugenic effects of chemical agents in {{male and female}} germ cells in vivo. The knowledge of stages of germ cell development and their duration for a given test animal is essential for these experiments. Commonly, mice or rats are employed. Structural chromosome aberrations can be analyzed microscopically in mitotic cell divisions of differentiating spermatogonia, zygotes, or early embryos {{as well as in}} first meiotic cell divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. Numerical chromosome aberrations are scorable during second meiotic divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. The micronucleus test is applicable to early round spermatids and to first cleavage embryos, and as in somatic cells, it assesses structural as well as numerical chromosome aberrations. In contrast to the somatic micronucleus assay, the timing of cell sampling determines whether the micronuclei scored in round spermatids were formed from structural or numerical aberrations, i. e. with short treatment sampling intervals the micronuclei are formed by exposed meiotic divisions and represent induced non-disjunction. On the contrary, after longer intervals of 12 – 14 days micronuclei are formed from induced unstable structural aberrations in differentiating spermatogonia or during the last round of DNA synthesis in early spermatocytes. Furthermore, labelling with fluorescent DNA-probes can be used to confirm these theoretical expectations. The mouse sperm-FISH assay is totally based on scoring colour spots from individual chromosomes (e. g. X, Y, and 8) hybridized with specific DNA-probes. The most animal demanding assay described here is the dominant lethal test. It is commonly performed with treated male laboratory rodents and allows the determination of the most sensitive developmental stage of spermatogenesis to a particular chemical under test. Theoretically, unstable structural chromosome aberrations in sperm will lead to foetal deaths after fertilization at around the time of implantation in the uterus wall. These can be scored as deciduomata or early dead foetuses in the uterus wall of the females at mid-pregnancy. None of the tests described in this chapter provide data for a quantitative estimate of the genetic risk to progeny from exposed germ cells.
