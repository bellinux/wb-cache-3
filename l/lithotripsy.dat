25|$|Treatment for LNS is symptomatic. Gout can {{be treated}} with {{allopurinol}} to control excessive amounts of uric acid. Kidney stones may be treated with <b>lithotripsy,</b> a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. There is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of LNS. Some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{maintaining}} {{a healthy weight}} and eating a diet high in fiber and low in simple carbohydrates. If there are no symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks, surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be either done through several small incisions or through a single larger incision. Surgery is typically done under general anesthesia. In those {{who are unable to}} have surgery, medication to try to dissolve the stones or shock wave <b>lithotripsy</b> may be tried.|$|E
500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave <b>lithotripsy.</b> This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic <b>lithotripsy,</b> where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E

2500|$|Cholesterol gallstones can {{sometimes}} be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth, {{but it may be}} necessary for the person to take this medication for years. Gallstones may recur, however, once the drug is stopped. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones {{can sometimes}} be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Gallstones can be broken up using a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave <b>lithotripsy</b> (often simply called [...] "lithotripsy"), which is a method of concentrating ultrasonic shock waves onto the stones to break them into tiny pieces. They are then passed safely in the feces. However, this form of treatment is suitable only when there is a small number of gallstones.|$|E
2500|$|Gallstones {{form when}} the bile is saturated, usually with either {{cholesterol}} or bilirubin. Most gallstones do not cause symptoms, with stones either {{remaining in the}} gallbladder or passed along the biliary system. When symptoms occur, severe [...] "colicky" [...] pain in the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt. If the stone blocks the gallbladder, inflammation known as cholecystitis may result. If the stone lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; and if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct, then pancreatitis may occur. Gallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound. When a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting it to be passed naturally. Given the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery to remove the gallbladder is often considered. Some medication, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, may be used; and <b>lithotripsy,</b> a procedure used {{to break down the}} stones, may also be used.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose we}} are all willing to let a public censor like P.V. run amuck {{whenever}} he likes,--so it be not down our street. I confess to {{a good deal of}} tolerance in this respect, and, when I live in No. 21, have plenty of stoicism to spare for the griefs of the dwellers in No. 23. Indeed, I agreed with our young Cato heartily in what he said about Statues. We must have an Act for the Suppression, either of Great Men, or else of Sculptors. I have not quite made up my mind which are the greater nuisances; but I am sure of this, that there are too many of both. They used to be rare (to use a Yankeeism omitted by Bartlett), but nowadays they are overdone. I am half inclined to think that the sculptors club together to write folks up during their lives in the newspapers, quieting their consciences with the hope of some day making them look so mean in bronze or marble as to make all square again. Or do we really have so many? Can't they help growing twelve feet high in this new soil, any more than our maize? I suspect that Posterity will not thank us for the hereditary disease of Carrara we are entailing on him, and will try some heroic remedy, perhaps <b>lithotripsy.</b>|$|E
