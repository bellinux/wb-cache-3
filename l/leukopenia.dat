5|$|Two of the {{patients}} at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other {{was admitted to the}} medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing <b>leukopenia</b> (low white blood cell count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including <b>leukopenia</b> later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then {{thought of as a}} rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (<b>leukopenia).</b> While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, <b>leukopenia</b> or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (<b>leukopenia),</b> lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leukopenia</b> and {{neutropenia}} – due to splenomegaly with splenic margination.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine {{has been}} {{associated}} with a decrease in white blood cell count (<b>leukopenia).</b> Lamotrigine does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects.|$|E
25|$|Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, {{the rapid}} and {{premature}} destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, <b>leukopenia,</b> and thrombocytopenia (with {{an increased risk}} of infection and bleeding).|$|E
25|$|<b>Leukopenia</b> and liver-damage of the cholostatic type with {{or without}} {{jaundice}} (icterus) have additionally been seen; the original manufacturer Roche recommends regular laboratory examinations to be performed routinely.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis, erythema multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, <b>leukopenia,</b> tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} of other causes of cytopenias, {{along with a}} dysplastic bone marrow, is required to diagnose a myelodysplastic syndrome, so differentiating MDS from anemia, thrombocytopenia, and <b>leukopenia</b> is important.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and <b>leukopenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complete Blood Count (CBC): {{a test of}} {{the white}} blood cells, red blood cells and {{platelets}} used to assess the presence of various disorders such as leukocytosis, <b>leukopenia,</b> thrombocytosis and anemia which may result from malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{treatment}} {{may lead to}} rare but life-threatening side effects. The rare side effects include <b>leukopenia</b> or pancreatitis. There may also be {{an increased risk of}} lymphoma that is associated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine treatment.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} virus {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, photophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. Children, in particular, may develop a hemorrhagic disease. <b>Leukopenia</b> with both {{lymphocytes}} and neutrophils is very common for Colorado tick fever virus. In either case, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects include: {{hepatotoxicity}} (liver damage), ulcerative stomatitis, <b>leukopenia</b> and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute pneumonitis, rarely pulmonary fibrosis, and kidney failure. Methotrexate is teratogenic and hence is not advised {{for either the}} prospective father to take it before or for the mother to take it before or during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and for a period after birth.|$|E
25|$|Cases of <b>leukopenia,</b> neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and {{pancytopenia}} (some fatal) {{have been}} reported with infliximab. The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of infliximab instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. The FDA issued a warning to doctors {{that there is an}} increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers {{associated with the use of}} infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{also carries}} five black box warnings, {{including}} warnings for agranulocytosis, {{central nervous system}} depression, <b>leukopenia,</b> neutropenia, seizure disorder, bone marrow suppression, dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, orthostatic hypotension (with or without syncope) and seizures. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.|$|E
25|$|Coltivirus is a genus {{of viruses}} (belonging to the Reoviridae family) that infects vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. It {{includes}} the causative agent of Colorado tick fever. Colorado tick fever virus {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, photophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. Children, in particular, may develop a hemorrhagic disease. <b>Leukopenia</b> with both lymphocytes and neutrophils is very common for Colorado tick fever virus. In either case, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Antiproliferative {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, <b>leukopenia,</b> pancytopenia, or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, duodenal ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, <b>leukopenia,</b> crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|GD type I (non-neuropathic) is {{the most}} common and least severe form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or in {{adulthood}} and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together hepatosplenomegaly) are common; the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and <b>leukopenia.</b> The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically, but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} leukocytes {{in the blood}} is often an {{indicator}} of disease, and thus the WBC count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 × 109/L and 11 × 109/L. In the US this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult, making them substantially less numerous than the RBCs at 40% to 45%. However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because immunity depends on it. An {{increase in the number}} of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called <b>leukopenia.</b> It weakens the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced <b>leukopenia</b> through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.|$|E

2500|$|Rarely {{and very}} rarely: taste disturbance, liver dysfunction, {{peripheral}} oedema, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, urinary, angioedema, anaphylaxis), photosensitivity, fever, sweating, depression, interstitial nephritis, blood disorders (including <b>leukopenia,</b> leukocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia), arthralgia, myalgia, skin reactions including (erythroderma Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous eruption) ...|$|E
2500|$|Blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia (low {{red blood}} cell count), <b>leukopenia</b> (white blood cell count<4000/µl), {{lymphopenia}} (<1500/µl), or low platelet count (<100000/µl) {{in the absence of}} offending drug; sensitivity = 59%; specificity = 89%. [...] Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 and C4 by immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency, which may predispose to SLE.|$|E
2500|$|Agranulocytosis, {{also known}} as agranulosis or granulopenia, is an acute {{condition}} involving a severe and dangerous <b>leukopenia</b> (lowered white blood cell count), most commonly of neutrophils causing a neutropenia in the circulating blood. [...] It is a severe lack of one major class of infection-fighting white blood cells. [...] People with this condition are at very high risk of serious infections due to their suppressed immune system.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{high risk}} that {{thalidomide}} can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, <b>leukopenia,</b> and lymphopenia, and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. [...] There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. [...] The drug can also damage nerves, causing peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible.|$|E
50|$|Medications {{that can}} cause <b>leukopenia</b> include clozapine, an {{antipsychotic}} medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). The antidepressant and smoking addiction treatment drug bupropion HCl (Wellbutrin) can also cause <b>leukopenia</b> with long-term use. Minocycline, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, is another drug known to cause <b>leukopenia.</b> There are also reports of <b>leukopenia</b> caused by divalproex sodium or valproic acid (Depakote), a drug used for epilepsy (seizures), mania (with bipolar disorder) and migraine.|$|E
50|$|Low {{white blood}} cell count: <b>leukopenia</b> or {{neutropenia}} (because neutrophils make up {{at least half of}} all white cells, they are almost always low in <b>leukopenia).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, ciclosporin, {{leflunomide}} and TNF inhibitors, have <b>leukopenia</b> as a known complication. [...] Interferons used {{to treat}} multiple sclerosis, such as interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b, can also cause <b>leukopenia.</b>|$|E
