Using empirical {{evidence from the}} <b>labour</b> <b>scheduling</b> process at one supermarket chain, the paper demonstrates that the longer-term negative effects of adopting a purely quantitative approach to <b>labour</b> <b>scheduling</b> and the resultant staff shortages can lead to decreased employee well-being, increased absenteeism and staff turnover levels. In turn, this not only pushes up costs of employment, but results in reduced customer service levels. Concludes that for many retailers a tension exists between espoused company thinking and organisational reality. For retailers with a commitment to a total customer service strategy such a quantitative approach to staffing issues is ineffective in the longer term...|$|E

The {{objective is to}} determine the optimum schedule to satisfy growing maintenance labour requirements with minimum cost and highest efficiency. Three alternative maintenance workforce schedules are compared. The first alternative is to continue with the traditional five-day workweek schedule currently being practiced by Afam power station maintenance line. The second alternative is to switch to a seven-day workweek schedule for the morning shift only. The third alternative is to use a seven-day workweek schedule for all three work shifts. The third alternative is chosen, as it is expected to save 11 % of the maintenance labour cost. Keywords: Power Station, Maintenance, Optimization, <b>Labour</b> <b>Scheduling.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|Recently, in {{the field}} of project {{scheduling}} problems the concept of partially renewable resources has been introduced. Theoretically, it is a generalization of both renewable and non-renewable resources. From an applied point of view, partially renewable resources allow us to model a large variety of situations that do not fit into classical models, but can be found in real problems in timetabling and <b>labour</b> <b>scheduling.</b> When modelling real problems, the problem of project scheduling with partially renewable resources, as many other combinatorial problems, gets such large dimensions that it is quite difficult to apply solution procedures.

40|$|MBA 2013 Abstract Introduction: Short-term layover {{maintenance}} activities at an airline base generally involve {{the execution of}} significant numbers of high-frequency, short-duration routine inspections in between flights on aircraft that are deployed to ongoing flight operations. The problem of scheduling labour supplies {{for this type of}} maintenance activity requires an operations manager to consider issues such as the number of scheduled flights each day, the timing constraints for the tasks that must be implemented on aircraft that are departing from or arriving at the base of operations, the employee skills and certifications that are needed to implement the required maintenance actions, as well as the potential for the planned flight schedule and associated maintenance schedule to be disrupted by unforeseen events such as flight delays. Published literature in the operations research subject area of ‘personnel scheduling’ covers a range of computational and mathematical techniques that can be adapted to solve or optimise this type of scheduling problem. This study has explored whether there is a significant knowledge gap between state-of-the-art developments in published research in this subject area and practical application at aircraft maintenance organisations on the African continent. Furthermore, the study has sought to establish whether computational models for the optimisation of an airline’s short-term layover maintenance labour resources that are based on a fixed flight schedule and thus a fixed task demand profile are sufficiently robust to the effects of flight schedule disruptions (e. g. delays) that occur routinely in real-life operations to support their practical application. Methods: A case study method has been employed in this study. In this regard, a case airline company based in Johannesburg, South Africa (with an in-house maintenance division) has been used for data collection purposes and for the implementation and testing of an experimental <b>labour</b> <b>scheduling</b> model for the short-term layover maintenance staffing problem. This <b>labour</b> <b>scheduling</b> model has been developed by adapting modelling concepts and techniques from contemporary operations research literature to the case setting.

40|$|An {{outcome of}} {{increased}} competition among businesses operating within logistic services {{is a trend}} towards allowing shorter cut-off {{time in order to}} achieve competitiveness. Reduced cut-off times result in greater fluctuations in labour demand for logistic companies. Fluctuations in demand limit the ability to operate efficient, which is essential for logistics services, as it is a low margin business. Three variables, size, complexity and cut-off time will be analysed regarding their impact on waste time, in order to increase efficiency. Findings indicated that low volume of transactions, in the number of order and order lines, correlate with increased waste time. A correlation between reduced cut-off time and increased waste time was also established. Furthermore, analysis indicated a weak correlation between increased complexity and waste time. The findings concluded that both volume and cut-off time are important factors and should be taken into consideration when designing an inventory solution. A calculation tool was developed in order to support estimating of labour demand for new customers and assessments. Leveling smoothens the demand and allows accurate <b>labour</b> <b>schedules.</b> This method can be used for inventory processes by merging several customers’ inventory processes in order to create larger and more stable demand. A merged inventory can be established by an automated inventory solution, which is in line with the trends toward automated environments.

40|$|Does {{an income}} tax harm {{economic}} efficiency more the more progressive it is? Public economics provides {{a strong case for}} a definite "yes. " But at least three forces may pull in the other direction. First, low-wage workers may on average have more elastic <b>labour</b> supply <b>schedules</b> than high-wage workers, in which case progressive taxes contribute to a more efficient allocation of the total tax burden. Second, in non-competitive labour markets, progressive taxes may encourage wage moderation, and hence reduce the equilibrium level of unemployment. And third, if wage setters have egalitarian objectives, progressive taxes may reduce the need for redistribution in pre-tax wages, and hence increase the demand for low-skilled workers. This paper surveys the theoretical, as well as the empirical literature about labour supply, taxes and wage setting. We conclude that in a second best world, the trade-off between equality and efficiency is not always inevitable. Copyright 2002 by Blackwell Publishers Ltd...|$|R

Over an extensive test data set, the target-staffing approach using problem-specific cost information outperformed all other procedures. Specifically, it generated schedules costing less than 87 % of those developed using the approach most commonly found in the literature. Its schedules were also almost 5 % cheaper than those of its closest competitor.

Multiskilling decreases the number of workers hired for a project and can improve productivity. Additional benefits include higher income and increased employability of the workforce. To take full advantage of these benefits, the workforce strategy and the planning and scheduling processes of a construction project must be adapted to use multiskilling effectively and efficiently. The multiskilled workforce should be scheduled and organized to maximize the duration of employment for workers, reduce the overall labour requirements and cover the skills combinations required by the project.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a {{consumer price index}} and two real wages series for Germany c. 1500 – 1850. Consumer price indices (CPI) based on eleven goods can be developed for ten towns; {{one of the two}} real wage series includes another six towns. Since German bullion markets were little integrated far into the early modern period it is difficult to establish a reliable national CPI. Preference should therefore be given to wage series that can be deflated by local CPIs. The analysis of the aggregate real wage series produces the following insights: First, there was a strong negative feedback between population and the real wage until the middle of the seventeenth century. While the Thirty Years War benefited the material welfare of the survivors through a huge decline in population size, the real wage was probably lower than extrapolated {{on the basis of the}} <b>labour</b> productivity <b>schedule,</b> suggesting a net loss in welfare. Second, the relationship between the real wage and population size was much weaker in the eighteenth than in the sixteenth century, which points to a continuous growth of labour productivity. Third, already between the 1810 s and 1820 s the Malthusian relationship between the real wage and population size prevailing in the eighteenth century was broken. The reasons for this structural rupture remain obscure and require further study. Consumer Prices, Germany, 1500...|$|R

This article uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey 2006 to explore the relationship between parents’ non-standard work hours, and the time they and their spouse spend in paid work, housework, childcare (subdivided into routine tasks and talk-based interaction) and in their children's company. Parents who work non-standard hours spend significantly longer in paid work and less time on housework and childcare than those who work standard hours. Spouses’ schedules impact much more on mothers’ than on fathers’ time. When fathers work non-standard hours, mothers do more housework and routine childcare, so the gendered division of household labour intensifies. Mothers’ non-standard hours allow them to schedule their own paid work and family responsibilities around each other, with little effect upon fathers’ unpaid work. childcare, gender division of <b>labour,</b> non-standard work <b>schedules,</b> time use, work-family balance...|$|R
40|$|Information on wage {{levels is}} {{essential}} in evaluating the living standards and conditions of work and life of the workers. Since nominal wage fails to explain the purchasing power of employees, real wage is considered as a major indicator of employees purchasing power {{and can be used}} as proxy for their level of income. Any fluctuations in the real wage rate {{have a significant impact on}} poverty and the distribution of income. When used in relation with other economic variables, for instance employment or output they are valuable indicators in the analysis of business cycles. There has been a long debate regarding the relationship between real wages and the employment (output). Despite the apparent simplicity, the relationship between real wages and output has remained deceptive both theoretically and empirically. Keynes (1936) viewed cyclical movements in employment along a stable <b>labour</b> demand <b>schedule</b> thus indicating counter cyclical real wages. His deduction is in line with sticky wages and sticky expectations, which augments models like Phillips curve. In these models real wages behaved as counter-cyclical as nominal wages are slow to adjust during recession (decrease in aggregate demand and associated slowdown in price growth). Stickiness of wages or expectations shifts the labour supply over the business cycles [Abraham and Haltiwanger (1995) ]. Barro (1990) and Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992) have associated these labour supply shifts with intertemporal labour-leisure substitution. This in response to temporary changes in real interest rates (fiscal policy shocks) could yield counter-cyclical real wages. However, Long and Plosser (1983) and Kydland and Prescott (1982) while studying the real business cycle models highlight on the technology shocks which leads to pro-cyclical real wages. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} pursuit of redistributional {{objectives}} may provide a rationale for origin-based taxation in small open economies. The analysis is developed in a simple two-class economy where consumers are classified according {{to the type of}} labour they supply. As world prices are given for a small open economy, the full burden of origin-based commodity taxes falls on the two types of labour. When a non-linear tax is levied on labour income, origin-based taxes cannot directly improve income distribution as the two types of labour face different marginal tax rates. However, the government can exploit the differential incidence of these origin-based taxes and increase social welfare by relaxing the self-selection constraints that bind the non-linear tax. Rather surprisingly, the value judgements embedded in the social welfare functional do not affect the structure of optimal origin-based commodity taxation. The paper also shows that the optimal structure of origin-based commodity taxation does not change when the <b>labour</b> income tax <b>schedule</b> is constrained to be linear, and that a positive source-based tax on capital income may be optimal if it results in a differential burden on the two types of labour. ...|$|R

An increase in construction time and cost is usually related to inefficiency or low productivity, which can be reduced by employing effective planning and monitoring. Schedule compression or work acceleration whether it is planned or unplanned, is normally required to recover projects from delay and inefficient works. It {{is not easy to}} perform schedule compression for people who do not have good knowledge and experience on construction processes. The situation can become very difficult and discouraging for many small contractors, especially during economic downturns. There is a need for a simple way to assess productivity and apply schedule compression by using simplified tools such as an index. This paper discusses an on-going research, which objective is to produce a project assessment tool called the Productivity Assessment and Schedule Compression Index (PASCI). This index utilizes a combination of weighted scores from key elements that affect <b>labour</b> productivity and <b>schedule</b> compression methods. It predicts the capability of completing a construction project by comparing the index score to its given contract period at a certain stage of a project. Using the index as a guide, further actions can be taken by contractors and clients, which could produce savings in terms of time and cost...|$|R
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child <b>labour</b> belonging to <b>Scheduled</b> Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made.

40|$|A quota-based {{integrated}} {{commercial fishery}} owns fishing trawlers, processing plants, and fish quotas. Such a fishery must {{decide how to}} schedule trawlers for fishing and landing, how to schedule processing of products, how to <b>schedule</b> <b>labour</b> for processing, and how to plan inventory of raw materials and products. This problem is of great economic significance to New Zealand, whose economy depends {{to a large extent}} on the fishery industry. To assist the fishery manager, we develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for optimal scheduling of fishing trawlers, production planning (processing) and labour allocation for a quota-based integrated fishery of New Zealand. The model decides when and where each trawler should go for fishing, how much fish each trawler should land, and how much product to produce in each period. Since the fishery is a private farm, its main objective will be profit maximization (or cost minimization if its demand is on contract). The government manages the conservation of fish through the quota allocation. In this thesis the objective of the fishery model is to maximise the total profit. We demonstrate our model with examples based on data from a major New Zealand fishery. We investigate ways to manage the uncertainties involved in trawler scheduling and production planning of the fishery. To manage end-of-planning-horizon effects in the fishery, we develop a simple safety stock approach. We also analyse the workability of a rolling horizon approach to solve the longer planning horizon models and to deal with the end-of-planning horizon effects. We investigate the effect of initial and final position of the trawlers on the profit. We also investigated many different challenging data sets to observe the impact on the effectiveness of our IFPM. The second objective of this thesis is to develop an efficient solution procedure for the MILP, named integrated fishery planning model (IFPM). The IFPM consists of a fishing subproblem, a processing subproblem, and complicating side constraints. We have tried techniques including LP relaxation, Lagrangean relaxation (LR), Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) and decomposition-based pricing (DBP). We develop a new DBP method to solve the IFPM. It gives excellent computation times. We also develop a decomposition-based O'Neill pricing (DBONP) method to improve the solution obtained from DBP procedure. It improves the DBP solutions but takes longer time to solve the IFPM. Finally, we develop a simple and efficient reduced cost-based pricing (RCBP) method. It takes less time to solve the IFPM and yields excellent results. The initial formulations for several planning horizons are solved using the AMPL modelling language and CPLEX with branch and bound.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to clarify the}} {{specific}} difference in bionomic characters of the five Japanese Vespa species, V. simillima xanthoptera CAMERON, V. analis insularis DALLA TORRE, V. crabro flavofasciata CAMERON, V. mandarinia japonica RADOSZKOWSKI and V. tropica pulchra BUYSSON, which coexist in low mountain areas of southwestJapan. The life history, nesting habits, feeding habits, division of labour and population dynamics, are described primarily by comparing them with each other. The field work was mainly carried out in and near Kibi-Cho, Wakayama, suthern Japan {{during the period from}} 1964 to 1975. A total of 622 nests was observed in and near the study area, and consisted of 288 nests of V. simillimm, 164 of V. analis, 80 of V. crabro, 56 of V. mandarinia and 34 of V. tropica. Results obtained are as follows : 1) The annual life cycle of the five Vespa species consists of the following six periods, though a little variation in details of the cycle occurs among them : （ 1 ）pre-nesting, （ 2 ）solitary, （ 3 ）cooperative, （ 4 ）polyethic, （ 5 ）reproductive and （ 6 ）hibernating period. Hibernated queens come out from their hibernacula during the period from early April to early June in the following order : simillima - mandarinia = crabro - analis - tropica. All of the species found their colonies with a single queen which constructs an average of 35 - 40 cells and rears 10 - 15 larvae up to the pupal stage by herself. The first workers emerge from June to July in the following order with a difference of 5 ～ 6 weeks in peak dates between V. simillima and V. tropica : siillima - crabro - analis - mandarinia - tropica. The queens are still iuvolved with both extranidal and intranidal activities for a while after worker emergence. This cooperative period lasts for 2 ～ 8 weeks and its length is inversely related to the typical colony size. As the number of workers increases, the queens of all species, other than V. tropica become restricted to oviposition, leaving all the other tasks to the workers. This expansive stage lasted until the time when sexuals are produced and the duration of the reproductive period lasts about a month in each species. The disintegration of the colony ordinarily takes place from early September to late November in the following order : trapica - crabro - analis - mandarinia = simillima. The queens hibernates singly in hibernating spaces within the soil or rotten wood. 2 ） Nest site preference is classified into the open place and concealed place types. V. analis and V. simillima belong to the former and V. tropica, and V. mandarinia to the latter. The queens of V. simillima and V crabro tend to initiate their nests in narrow, covered places or underground cavities. When the nest become too large after the emergence of workers, the whole colony moves a new, more spacious site. 3 ）The shape of the completed queen nest was divided into the three types : bowl - shaped （V. tropica and V. mandarinia）, ball - shaped （V. crabro and V. simillima) and flask-shaped (V. analis). The general shape of mature nests varies between the species of the open preference and those of the concealed place preference. In the former group （V. simillima and V. analis） the envelope is usually thick, covering the combs completely. In developed nests of these species the envelopes consist of multilayered shell - like sheets enclosing many air chambers among them. In the latter group （V. crabro, V. tropica and V. mandarinia）, the envelope consists of only a few plate - like sheets with imperfect air chambers, and the lowest comb is always exposed. 4 ）The foods of Vespa consist of two well difined classes, carbohydrate and protein. The former are obtained from tree sap, honew -dew of aphids and psyllids, flower nectar, mushroom and syrup juice. The most important source for all the Vespa species was the tree sap exduing from apertures of living trees. Both intra - and interspecifically a distinct linear dominance order is recognized among the hornets visiting tree sap. Interspecific relationships among both queens and workers at food sources are as follows : mandarinia - analis - crabro - simillima - tropica. 5 ）Prey preftrence of Vespa differed characteristically with species. V. simillima and V. analis hunt a wide range of insects and spiders. V. crabro is regarded as a semi - specialist, preferring various kinds of cicadas, and is highly specialized behaviourally for capturing cicadas. V. tropica is a typical specialist, being almost exclusively dependent on the brood of polistine wasps for their protein food and the life cycle was synchronized with that of the prey wasps. V. mandarinia attacks in mass the colonies of other social wasps and honeybees, possessing an ability to hunt a wide variety of large insects and spiders. Group predation consists of three phases, hunting, slaughter and nest occupation. 6 ）The queen of Vespa hornets do not engage in cell initiation after worke remergence, though she still participate in intranidal activities for a while. 7 ）Any Vespa worker would perform any task within a few days after emergence without a <b>labour</b> <b>schedule</b> depending on age distinction as known in the honeybee. 8 ）In the case of V. analis worker oviposited {{a few days after the}} death of the queen. This 'substitution queen' was characterized by the following points; （ 1 ）acting as the primary or sole egg-layer, （ 2 ）loss of hairs on the gena and mandibular base and polished head as in the queen, （ 3 ）cessation of all extranidal activities, （ 4 ）superior dominance, （ 5 ）receiving a great deal of food from the other workers, and （ 6 ）remarkable prolongation of life span. 9 ）Total duration of brood development from egg to adult varis on the average from 30. 8 days in V. simillima to 40. 1 days in V. mandarinia. There is a tendency for the larger the body size in adult hornets, the longer the duration became among the five species. 10 ）The survivorship curve during the polyethic period is of a convex type in each species; remarkably low mortality during the immature stages and high mortality after the commencement of foraging activities in the adult stage. 11 ）After the emergence of sexuals, high mortality was observed throughout all developmental stages, particularly egg and 5 th instar, which was probably caused by a decrease in attention given to the brood. 12 ）The general pattern of seasonal colony development in the five Vespa species is characterized by slow development in the early stage, followed by explosive development in the later stage and then the rapid and terminal decline after sexuals have been produced. The colonial life of V. tropica is about 3. 5 to 4 months, while that of V. simillima 7 to 7. 5 months. The other three species occupy intermediate positions between the two extremes, in the following order : simillima - mandarinia - analis - crabro - tropica. 13) Comparing the colony size at peak, the maximum number of cells was ca. 300 in V. tropica, ca 900 in V. analis, ca 4, 500 in V. mandarinia and V. crabro and ca. 10, 000 in V. simillima. 14 ）New queens emerged during the period ftom early September to late November in the following order : tropica - arabro - analis - simillima - mandarinia. Just prior to the production of new queens, the larva : worker ratio is reduced to its lowest level, below about 2. 0, in each Vespa species. 15 ）The minimum number of workers in a mature colony which is considered as necessary to succeed in producing new queens varies with the species. In V. tropica they can be produced in a colony with more than ca. 20 workers, while in V. simillima colonies the number of workers present needs to reach at least ca. 300 workers. 16 ）The maximum number of sexuals present per colony varied from 56 new queens and 27 males in a V. tropica colony 1, 692 new queens and 1, 123 males in a V. simillima colony and is ranked as simillima > mandarinia > crabro > analis > tropica. In general it is recognized that the larger the colony, the more sexuals are produced not only in the same species but also among the five species. 17 ）Mortality factors working mainly at the nest level are divided into five main causes, （ 1 ）disappearance of queen, （ 2 ）natural enemies, （ 3 ）human interference, （ 4 ）climatic factors and （ 5 ）unknown causes. The end of Vespa colonies occurs very frequently during the solitary period and following cooperalive period when the queen continues to forage outside the nest, which is attributable to the disappearance of the queen. The heavy predation by V. mandarina results in the greatest proportion of all the unsuccessful nests at mature stage in each Vespa species except for V. mandarinia. In the case of V. mandarinia, destruction by beekeepers plays an important role in colony mortality of mature nests. 18 ） Annual fluctuations in the number of V. simillima colonies surveyed in four adjacent areas covering ca. 300 ha. gave a nest density of 0. 01 ～ 0. 03 nests per ha. during 12 years, and the total number of nests varied from 3 ～ 10 per year. 19 ） A mechanism to explain the coexistence of the five Vespa species in southwestern Japan is discussed from the view point of the occupation of different ecological niches including nest site, food preference and colony cycle. 本論文では，日本の西南暖地の低山地から平地に同所的に生息する 5 種のスズメバチ属のハチ類，すなわち，キイロスズメバチ Vespa simillima xanthoptera CAMERON（以下キイロ），コガタスズメバチ Vespa analis insularis DALLA TORRE（以下コガタ），モンスズメバチ Vespa crabro flavofasciata CAMERON（以下モン），オオスズメバチ Vespa mandarinia japonica RADOSZKOWSKl（以下オオ），ヒメスズノバチ Vespa ｔropica pulchra BUYSSON（以下ヒメ）について，各種の生活史，営巣習性，採餌習性，分業，個体群の動態などを明らかにし，これらの種の共存の機構を考察したものである。 調査は 1964 年より 1975 年までの 12 年間にわたって和歌山県有田郡吉備町とその周辺の地域で行なわれ，総計 622 巣のスズメパチ属の巣を観察の対象としている。 1. 生活史 生活史の質的変化を成虫の社会関係を中心に区分するとつぎの 6 段階，すなわち，（ 1 ）前営巣期（ 2 ）女王の単独営巣期（ 3 〉女王と働きばちの共同営巣期，（ 4 ）分業期，（ 5 〉繁殖カスト産出期，（ 6 〉越冬期となる。越冬後の女王は 4 月上旬より 6 月上旬の間に，キイロ-オオ=モン-コガタ-ヒメの順に出現する。各種とも単雌創設で，受精したメス（=女王）のみが創巣し，単独営巣期に 35 ～ 40 房をつくり，そのうち 10 ～ 15 頭の幼虫を単独で育てあげる。最初の働きばちは 6 ～ 7 月に，キイロ-モン-コガタ-オオ-ヒメの順に羽化する。共同常巣期は 2 ～ 8 週間で，その長さは一般にそれぞれの種のコロニーサイズと関連があり，キイロのような大規模営巣型の種では短かく，コガタやヒメのような小規模営巣型の種では長い。働きばちの個体数の増加にともない，ヒメを除く他の 4 種では，女王は産卵活動に専念し，分業期の後半にほ，働きばちが女王をとりまくローヤルコートが出現する。オスと新女王はコロニーの働きばちの個体数が最多状態に達した時より約 1 ケ月以上にわたって産出され 交尾は巣外で行なわれる。営巣活動の終息は 9 月上旬より 11 月下旬までで，ヒメ-モン-コガタ-オオ-キイロの順となっている。 2. 営巣習性 営巣場所は開放空間型（コガタ），遮蔽空間型（モン，ヒメ，オオ），両空間型（キイロ）に区別される。キイロとモンは造巣当初は狭い遮蔽空間を選好する傾向があるが，働きばちの羽化後の 7 - 8 月に，より広い遮蔽空間（モン）および開放空間（キイロ）へコロニーが移住したのち新女王の産出を行なうことが多く，営巣末期の巣ではキイロ 88. 6 %，モン 53. 5 %が引越巣であった。巣の構造は，女王巣の場合，外被の形状により 3 型，すなわち，皿型（ヒメ，オオ），椀型（モン，キイロ），徳利型（コガタ）に区別される。成熟巣では，開放空間選好種のコガタとキイロでは，外被は貝殻状をした多数の空気室で構成され，ただ 1 個の側部の出入口を残して巣盤全体な完全に被護するが，遮蔽空間選好種のモン，ヒメ，オオでは，外被は不完全な空気室をもった数枚のシートで構成され，最下段の巣盤が常に露出して出入口を兼ねる。 3. 採餌習性 炭水化物源は 5 種ともに共通し，樹液，半翅目昆虫の甘露，花蜜，熱果，キノコ（シラタマタケ），空罐や空びん内に残されたジュースなどで，最も重要なものは樹液とキノコである。蛋白源となる獲物とその狩猟行動に顕著な種間差がみられる。キイロとコガタは「何でも屋」で，前者は 8 目 44 種以上の昆虫やクモな狩り，そのうちの 60 %は双翅目の成虫で占められたが，後者は 8 目 53 種以上でそのうち双翅目成虫 37. 9 %についで膜翅目の有剣類成虫も 32. 2 %を占め，アシナガバチ亜料やスズメバチ亜料の種も含まれる。モンは獲物の 95 %以上がセミ類によって占められるが，大型のトンボ，バッタなども捕らえる能力をもち「準専門家」とみなされる。ヒメは典型的な「専門家」で，アシナガバチ亜科の各種の巣を襲って，その幼虫と蛹の体液のみを摂取する。オオは単独ではドウガネブイブイなどの中型のコガネムシ類を中心に，多肉で動きの鈍い昆虫やクモを狩る「準専門家」であるが，同じ巣の働きばち集団が，同属他種のスズメバチ，クロスズメバチ属，ミツバチ属などの社会性ハチの巣を襲い，相手を全滅させたのち幼虫や蛸を掠奪する習性を発達させている。これが，明治以降にわが国へ導入されたセイヨウミツバチに対する集団攻撃の起源とみなされ，単独捕食期，集団殺戮期，占領掠奪期に区別して解析した。 4. 分業 女王は働きばちの羽化後は，外役，ついで内役の順に引退したのち産卵に尊念する。モンの女王の場合，巣づくり行動には，働きばちの出現後も約 40 日にわたって参加したが，この間に（ 1 ）育房の新設，（ 2 ）みずから野外で集めた巣材による外被や房壁の伸長，外被をかじりとって得た巣材による房璧の伸長，（ 4 巣材を集めずに，働きばちが伸ばした直後の湿った房壁の再加工（薄く伸ばす）の順に停止とする。働きばちの日齢と仕事に関しては， 5 種ともに羽化後 2 日目巨より各種の内役を行ない， 3 ～ 4 日目にほ定位飛行ののち，すぐに巣材，食物，水などの採集活動に従事し，老齢化しても，巣の内外のあらゆる仕事をこなす能力をもつ。女王の亡失巣では，数日後に働きばちの一部の卵巣が発達し，女王の代位となる個体が出現する。コガタの場合，「代位女王」は次の特性をもつ。（ 1 ）唯一の，または最優位の産卵者としてオスを産出する，（ 2 〉分業期の女王にみられるような体毛の脱落，および体表面が油じみた光沢なもつ，（ 3 ）あらゆる外役への不参加，（ 4 ）他の働きばちに対する優位行動，（ 5 ）他の働きばちからの頻繁な食物摂取，（ 6 ）寿命の著しい延長。 5. 個体群の動態 働きばちの卵から羽化までの発育所要日数は種によって異なり，分業期ではキイロの 30. 8 日からオオの 40. 11 日までの幅があり，大型種ほどその期間が長くなる傾向がある。働きばちの生存曲線は， 5 種ともに典型的な凸型を示し，卵から羽化後 2 - 3 日目までの非外役期では非常に死亡率が低いが，外役活動の開始とともに死亡が一定の割合で起こり，小型種ほど成虫の寿命が短い傾向を示した。また，新女王の羽化の始まったコロニーでは，働きばちの給餌対象が幼虫から新女王成虫へと転換し，そのため幼虫の餓死や非成虫個体に対する共食いが急増して，営巣活動の崩壊を促進した。営巣期間は種によって異なり，短期営巣型のヒメほ 3. 5 ～ 4 ケ月に過ぎないが，長期営巣型のキイロほ 7 ～ 7 ． 5 ケ月で，他の 3 種はキイロ-オオ-コガタ-モン-ヒメの順に両種の中間に位置する。営巣規模は顕著な種間差があり，小規模営巣型のヒメは最多育房数で 300 房であるが，大規模営巣型のキイロでは 10, 000 房に達する。オオとモンは中規模営巣型とみなされ最多育房数で 4, 500 房となるが，コガタは 1, 000 房以下で小規模営巣型とみなされる。新女王の羽化期も種によって異なり．ヒメ-モン-コガタ-キイロ-オオの順に， 9 月上旬より 11 月下旬までの幅がある。新女王の産出にさきがけ，幼虫 : 働きばちの割合（L／W比）は各種とも全営巣期を通じて最低値に下降し，その値は 2. 0 前後となっている。新女王の産出のために必要な働きばちの個体数は種によって著しく異なり，ヒメでは約 20 頭以上であるが，キイロでは少くとも 300 頭以上とみなされ，他種は両者の間に位置する。コロニーあた りの新女王とオスの産出数は，一般にコロニーサイズが大きくなるほどその数も多くなり，その最大値はキイロで新女王 1, 692 頭，オス 1, 123 頭，最少値はヒメで新女王 56 頭，オス 27 頭であり， 5 種ではキイロ＞オオ＞モン＞コガタ＞ヒメの順になっている。廃巣要因は，女王の亡失，天敵（オオスズメバチ，ハチクマ ，スズメバチネジレバネなど），人の干渉，気象，不明などで， 5 種ともに単独営巣期から共同営巣期の段階こおいて，女王の亡失による廃巣が最も多くなっている。巣の年次変動に関しては，キイロの場合， 300 haにおける 12 年間の成熟巣の数をみると 3 ～ 10 巣/年と低密度の安定型を示した。巣あたりの新女王の生産数の多さに比べ，巣の密度が非常に低いので，本種は強力な密度の自己調節能力をもつとみなされるが，他の 4 種もその可能性をもつ。以上の結果から，これら 5 種のスズメバチは，営巣習性，採餌習性，新女王の生産期などの生態的地位をそれぞれ異にすることによって相互の競争的関係を少なくして，同所的に生息を可能にしているものと推論した...|$|R
