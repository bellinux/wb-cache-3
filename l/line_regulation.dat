50|$|An LDO is {{characterized}} by its drop-out voltage, quiescent current, load regulation, <b>line</b> <b>regulation,</b> maximum current (which is decided {{by the size of}} the pass transistor), speed (how fast it can respond as the load varies), voltage variations in the output because of sudden transients in the load current, output capacitor and its equivalent series resistance. Speed is indicated by the rise time of the current at the output as it varies from 0 mA load current (no load) to the maximum load current. This is basically decided by the bandwidth of the error amplifier. It is also expected from an LDO to provide a quiet and stable output in all circumstances (example of possible perturbation could be: sudden change of the input voltage or output current). Stability analysis put in place some performance metrics to get such a behaviour and involve placing poles and zeros appropriately. Most of the time, there is a dominant pole that arise at low frequencies while other poles and zeros are pushed at high frequencies.|$|E

The {{pros and cons of}} several control methods suitable for very high frequency resonant converters are described and compared to outphasing modulation.

Finally a design example is given for a converter consisting of two class E inverters with a lossless combiner and a common half bridge rectifier. It is shown how outphasing modulation can be used for <b>line</b> <b>regulation</b> while insuring equal and purely resistive loading of the inverters. Combined with a proper design of the inverters that, insures they can achieve zero voltage switching across a wide load range, and gallium nitride FETs for the switching devices, this makes it possible to achieve more than 90 % efficiency across most of the input voltage range with good <b>line</b> <b>regulation.</b> Danish National Advanced Technology Foundatio...|$|E
