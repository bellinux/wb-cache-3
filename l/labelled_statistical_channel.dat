40|$|Abstract—As UWB {{channels}} for BANs behave as linear systems, an alternative form of channel modeling is by linear prediction of the channel’s transfer function obtained from measurements. The main reason {{of this is}} a more accurate reproduction of the channel transfer function with less parameters than conventional <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> models. In contrast to conventional <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> models, where channel impulse responses are constructed from a statistical characterization of multipath amplitudes, phases and delays arriving in clusters, etc., the channel impulse response derived from an ARMA channel model is more accurate than a <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> model. Indeed, as this ARMA channel model is derived directly from measured channel transfer functions. So, it is expected that this channel impulse response is more accurate. Recall, a <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> model has some degree of error depending how precise the statistical characterization was performed. Moreover, the whole propagation phenomena (large scale and small scale fading) are embedded in a simple model.

As introduced in our previous work the RSSD localization is assisted with one Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation. The use of directional receiving antennas and an omni-directional transmitting antenna is assumed. Localization is performed in 2 D.

40|$|In {{molecular}} communication (MC) systems, {{the expected}} number of molecules observed at the receiver over {{time after the}} instantaneous release of molecules by the transmitter {{is referred to as}} the channel impulse response (CIR). Knowledge of the CIR is needed for the design of detection and equalization schemes. In this paper, we present a training-based CIR estimation framework for MC systems which aims at estimating the CIR based on the observed number of molecules at the receiver due to emission of a sequence of known numbers of molecules by the transmitter. Thereby, we distinguish two scenarios depending on whether or not <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> knowledge is available. In particular, we derive maximum likelihood (ML) and least sum of square errors (LSSE) estimators which do not require any knowledge of the channel statistics. For the case, when <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> knowledge is available, the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators are provided. As performance bound, we derive the classical Cramer Rao (CR) lower bound, valid for any unbiased estimator, which does not exploit <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> knowledge, and the Bayesian CR lower bound, valid for any unbiased estimator, which exploits <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> knowledge. Finally, we propose optimal and suboptimal training sequence designs for the considered MC system. Simulation results confirm the analysis and compare the performance of the proposed estimation techniques with the respective CR lower bounds.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the channel modelling and relay techniques in powerline communications (PLC) {{which is considered}} as a promising technology for the Smart Grid communications, Internet access and home area network (HAN). In this thesis, the <b>statistical</b> PLC <b>channel</b> characteristics are investigated, a new <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> modelling method is proposed for the in-door PLC. Then a series of the relay protocols are suggested for the broadband communications over power grid. The <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> modelling method is proposed to surmount {{the limits of the}} traditional deterministic PLC channel models such as multipath model and transmission line model. To develop the channel model, the properties of the multipath magnitudes, interval between the paths, cable loss and the channel classification are investigated in detail. Then, each property is described by statistical distribution or formula. The simulation results show that the statistical model can describe the PLC channels as accurate as deterministic models without the topology information which is a time-consuming work for collecting. The relay transmission is proposed to help PLC adapting the diverse application scenarios. The protocols covers the main relay aspects which include decode/amplify forwarding, single/ multiple relay nodes, full/half duplex relay working mode. The capacity performance of each protocol is given and compared. A series of the facts which improve the performance of the PLC networks are figured out according to simulation results. The facts include that the decode-and-forward is more suitable for the PLC environment, deviation or transforming station is better location for placing relay node and full duplex relay working mode help exploiting the capacity potential of the PLC networks.

In [10], a dynamic resource allocation algorithm aiming to maximize the delay-limited capacity of a cooperative communication with <b>statistical</b> <b>channel</b> information is developed.

Finally, we apply our results to channel measurements at 2. 53 GHz.
