5|$|The JBL D44000 Paragon is {{an iconic}} {{one-piece}} stereo <b>loudspeaker</b> created by JBL that {{was introduced in}} 1957 and discontinued in 1983; its production run was the longest of any JBL speaker. At its launch, the Paragon was the most expensive domestic <b>loudspeaker</b> on the market.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic <b>Loudspeaker</b> (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic <b>loudspeaker,</b> {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co.

5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of <b>loudspeaker</b> output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive <b>Loudspeaker</b> (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} <b>loudspeaker</b> {{driven by the}} need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small <b>loudspeaker</b> that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|Horn <b>loudspeakers</b> {{are used}} in many audio applications. The drivers in horn <b>loudspeakers</b> can be very small, even for bass {{frequencies}} where conventional <b>loudspeakers</b> {{would need to be}} very large for equivalent performance. Horn <b>loudspeakers</b> can be designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies using a single, small driver; to some extent these can be designed without requiring a crossover. Lowther, Fostex, and Goodmans are firms which have produced such designs.|$|R

5|$|The {{authorized}} <b>loudspeaker</b> enclosure to {{use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
50|$|October and November found The Corrs {{wheeling}} through 18 arena {{dates in}} seven European countries with a substantial Meyer Sound system provided by England's Canegreen Ltd.

5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a <b>loudspeaker</b> array.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} <b>loudspeaker</b> system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Robert Jackson (3 June 1949 – 29 January 2011) was an Australian audio {{engineer}} who co-founded JANDS, an Australian audio, lighting and staging company. He joined American touring audio engineer Roy Clair and mixed concert stage monitors for Elvis Presley in the 1970s. With Clair Brothers, a concert sound company, Jackson designed audio electronics including a custom mixing console. Beginning in 1978, Jackson toured as Bruce Springsteen's band engineer for a decade, using Clair Brothers sound systems. A business interest in Fairlight CMI in Sydney introduced Jackson to digital audio, and he subsequently founded the digital audio company Apogee Electronics in Santa Monica, California, {{where he lived}} at the time. After selling his share of Apogee, Jackson co-founded with Roy and Gene Clair a joint venture which produced the Clair iO, a <b>loudspeaker</b> management system for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson turned the venture commercial {{with the help of}} Dave McGrath's Lake Technology. Dolby Laboratories bought the technology and formed Dolby Lake with Jackson as vice president, then in 2009 Lab.gruppen acquired the brand. Jackson was honoured with the Parnelli Innovator Award in 2005 for his inventive <b>loudspeaker</b> controller.|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} {{takes the}} artistic {{use of the}} devices that bring sound waves into electricity and back as its central focus point; they are commonly called microphones and <b>loudspeakers.</b> These devices have become essential for many forms of music making. Through the same pair of <b>loudspeakers,</b> people listen to diverse music and sound, such as violin sonatas, rock songs or simply the latest news. Accordingly, microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> are often designed to remain transparent; that is, "inaudible" in the final sound result. From the 1950 s on, microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> started to {{play a crucial role}} not only in the mere reproduction of sound, but also in the creation of music. Composers and musicians often described these new possibilities of using microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> as musical instruments. This resulted not only in many pieces and performances that used microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> in unusual ways but also in many new possibilities for musical composition. Confronted with microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> through my own practice as a composer using electro-acoustic media, I investigated how microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> could become musical instruments. This resulted in 28 compositions and a text about historical, theoretical, and practical aspects of the subject. To obtain a clear picture of the possibilities of microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> in music, I develop four approaches in my dissertation. Three of them focus on the transparent use (reproducing, supporting and generating). The fourth approach focuses on the use of microphone and <b>loudspeakers</b> in an opaque way; that is, as musical instruments. I call this the interacting approach, since the music should, in contrast to the other approaches, not be transmitted through microphones and <b>loudspeakers,</b> but formed, coloured, and changed by these devices. The fourth approach was the starting point for 28 compositions, in which I investigate in what ways one could interact or "play" microphones and <b>loudspeakers.</b> This resulted in a categorisation of three interaction parameters: movement, material and space. I looked at how these interaction parameters might be recognised in the work of other musicians and composers, as well as how the interaction with microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> influenced compositional form, the performance situation, and the relationship between musician and musical instrument. This resulted in a theory and praxis in which I elaborate upon unique features of music, composed with microphones and loudspeakersPromotores: Frans de Ruiter, Richard Barrett, Co-promotor: Marcel CobussenWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
50|$|Acoustic {{enhancement}} systems use microphones, amplifiers, and <b>loudspeakers</b> interconnected {{with some}} form of processing. The number, type, and placement of microphones and <b>loudspeakers</b> varies according to both the application, {{as well as the}} physics limitations that are imposed by the inherent operating principles associated with each manufacturer's equipment. In most instances, however, these systems employ at least one array of <b>loudspeakers</b> that are distributed throughout the venue.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1970s, Community {{became one}} of the first {{companies}} to meticulously test and document the performance of both its own <b>loudspeakers</b> and competitors’ <b>loudspeakers.</b> Community based its test measurement philosophy on the underlying principles of “free field” and “far field,” believing that far more dependable and relevant data can be obtained by testing <b>loudspeakers</b> at measurement distances that correspond to actual listening distances.|$|R

5|$|Guardian {{operates}} {{with five}} trains, each containing two cars that were manufactured by Art Engineering. Each car seats four riders back-to-back in seated rows; each train can seat eight riders. Every seat has a lap-bar restraint, a light gun, and a <b>loudspeaker</b> that provides sound during the ride. This configuration allows {{the ride to}} theoretically carry 650 riders per hour. The cars can rotate 90 degrees in both directions. The trains' light guns are programmed to display a unique colour on the ride's screens to indicate where each rider is shooting and to distinguish between shooters.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn {{to develop the}} <b>loudspeaker</b> system of the 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT). Arriving in the marketplace in 1945, it offered better coherence and clarity at high power levels. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the movie theater industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Summing localization: {{for time}} delays below 2 ms, {{listeners}} only perceive one sound; its direction {{is between the}} locations of the lead and lag sounds. An application for summing localization is the intensity stereophony, where two <b>loudspeakers</b> emit the same signal with different levels, resulting in the localized sound direction between both <b>loudspeakers.</b> The localized direction depends on the level difference between the <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{professional}} audio applications, small <b>loudspeakers</b> {{are often}} mounted {{on or near}} (within the <b>loudspeaker’s</b> near field region) large solid surfaces, such as mixing consoles, desktops and work surfaces. In approximately two-thirds of <b>loudspeakers</b> mounted in such a fashion, the magnitude response is compromised in a predictable and systematic way. An upward deviation of peak value 5. 0 dB ± 1. 5 dB centred on 141 Hz ± 31 Hz was observable in approximately 80 % of the cases studied. An additional Room Response Control in active <b>loudspeakers</b> is proposed to compensate for this aberration.

5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a <b>loudspeaker</b> enclosure—often made of wood—capable of {{withstanding}} air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} <b>loudspeaker.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—People {{prefer to}} be able to enjoy spatial audio without wearing a headphone. Such a {{tethered}} device is anyway inconve-nient and undesirable, if not cumbersome. Alternatively, 3 -D sound can be delivered to a listener with <b>loudspeakers.</b> However, crosstalk arises, and the rendered binaural signals are distorted by room re-verberation when arriving at the listener’s two ears, which lead to the need for a crosstalk cancellation and equalization (CTCE) system. Classical CTCE systems employ only two <b>loudspeakers,</b> and their performance is usually unsatisfactory in practice. While the idea of using more <b>loudspeakers</b> has been investigated, it was never shown why using more <b>loudspeakers</b> is theoretically more advantageous for CTCE. In this letter, we will study this problem and demonstrate that with two <b>loudspeakers,</b> only a least-squares (LS) solution can be obtained, while using multiple <b>loudspeakers,</b> we have more options: either an LS solution or an exact solution for perfect CTCE.
