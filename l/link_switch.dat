30|$|The main {{advantage}} of soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> over hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> {{is a better}} guarantee in data transmission, which originates from the significantly smaller <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay.

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{presented}} a novel hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme, which overcomes the drawbacks of conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, for VLC networks. The proposed scheme uses pre-scanning and predictive RSS methods {{to reduce the}} <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay and the unnecessary <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> ratio. In addition, the SINR and the outage probability are analyzed {{with respect to the}} <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> situation in a VLC environment. The proposed scheme achieves a lower outage probability compared to the conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. To utilize our proposed scheme, {{there is no need to}} change the hardware of the user devices and the IEEE 802.15. 7 MAC operation. Therefore, the proposed scheme is expected to be a possible approach for a practical <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> implementation.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} device technologies is enabling seamless mobility, {{but there are still}} major concerns related to the performance of security. The handoff performance correlates with inter-wireless <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> latency and network layer latency, with security being required at both levels. Authentication latency has a significant impact, especially on the <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> phase, in the case of cross-domain mobility because of the requirement of remote contact with a home authentication server. Providing a solution to minimize the latency impact without degrading the level of security is a major challenge. In this thesis, we propose a high-performance authentication architecture to tackle the latency problem in fast inter-domain handoffs. The architecture consists of three contributions. First, we present a decentralized authentication scheme by introducing a deputy agent in control of a group of access points. The collaborating deputy agents considerably reduce long-distance traffic of authentication messages. Then, we propose a mobility-adjusted authentication protocol (MAP) dedicated to cross-domain handoffs, cooperating with the deputy agents. The protocol leverages the concept of security context to achieve minimum handshakes so that one can significantly reduce the authentication latency. Finally, we design a security context router (SCR) that extends the deputy agent to manage security contexts. The SCR realizes seamless cross-domain mobility with the predictive forwarding of security context that is characterized by approximate pattern matching and statistical estimation. The contributions made by this thesis have transparently led to significant improvements in the performance of handoff processes without compromising high-level security.

30|$|An energy {{efficiency}} and load balancing optimization algorithm called as Green-Load-balancing Algorithm (GLA) based on existing <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> off techniques is introduced in [51]. By optimizing the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) link weights of a network, energy saving gains are obtained by using the link sleeping and load balancing jointly. The algorithm aims to put more links to sleep without affecting the load balancing requirements. In simulations, the GEANT is used. The GLA is compared with Interior Gateway Protocol Weight Optimization (IGP-WO), and it is obtained that GLA shows slightly better performance than IGP-WO in terms of load balancing and results in energy savings at the same time. According to several experiment scenarios, the proposed algorithm improves the {{energy efficiency}} and enhances the performance of existing switch off algorithms in terms of energy efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Visible light {{communication}} (VLC) {{is gaining}} increasing attention {{and is considered}} as a promising technology for future wireless indoor communications. Because movable users expect a seamless connectivity experience when switching among transmitters (i.e., VLC access points) in the VLC system, fast <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> operations must be supported by the networks. This paper presents a novel hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme for VLC networks {{with the use of}} pre-scanning and received signal strength (RSS) prediction. Our proposed scheme achieves the advantages of both conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes without changing device hardware or the IEEE 802.15. 7 medium access control (MAC) protocol. To help compare our proposed scheme with conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the outage probability regarding the <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> situation, and the queuing models for <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes are taken into account.

30|$|During a hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> procedure, {{user devices}} cannot receive the {{signal from the}} serving transmitter, {{which leads to a}} data {{interruption}} problem and then QoS degradation. Thus, the process duration of a hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme (i.e., <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay), which mainly originates from the scanning period, is an important problem in terms of guaranteeing a seamless data transmission. This problem can be solved effectively in soft <b>link</b> <b>switching.</b> In soft <b>link</b> <b>switching,</b> a user device can simultaneously communicate with two or more transmitters, including its current serving transmitter. The link between the user device and its current serving transmitter is disconnected only after it has successfully connected to the target transmitter.|$|R
30|$|A {{table lookup}} bypass (TLB) {{approach}} is proposed in [49]. Under suitable traffic conditions, the table lookup (TL) {{operation of a}} line card (LC) is bypassed and the received packets are deterministically forwarded through the next-hop router. Forwarding engine (FE) functionalities are frozen, and power dissipation is significantly reduced. By this way, the forwarding operation is independently achieved by each LC in core IP routers. The proposed approach also combines TLB and <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> off (LSO) approaches. There are two alternatives: to switch a whole link off or freeze out only the FE of LC. Especially in high traffic conditions, the proposed approach promises a lower energy consumption. It is pointed out that TLB is very suitable when LSO cannot be fulfilled; in other words, traffic load does not allow switching off of other links when the network is highly meshed.|$|E
30|$|A {{distributed}} energy-aware {{traffic engineering}} analysis DAISIES is proposed in [52]. DAISIES uses routing-based approach where the <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> off process is handled individually by each node. The switching off process is managed {{with respect to}} the traffic variations. A definite load-dependent link-weight function is proposed to perform DAISIES more efficiently. The proposed scheme is different from other studies in two important aspects: there is no off-line centralized component, and it searches for the best path for each traffic demand rather than search for the best set of links to switch off. It takes advantage of traffic engineering of the existing routers and modifies the path computation strategy, and it does not require significant changes in current routers. The event-driven simulation packet is used for simulations. For different traffic conditions, DAISIES performance is tested and it is observed that the proposed scheme provides significant energy gains.|$|E

In this paper, we present SNAP, a scalable network-application profiler that guides developers in identifying and fixing performance problems. SNAP passively collects TCP statistics and socket-call logs with low computation and storage overhead, and correlates across shared resources (e. g., host, <b>link,</b> <b>switch)</b> and connections to pinpoint {{the location of the}} problem (e. g., send buffer mismanagement, TCP/application conflicts, application-generated microbursts, or network congestion).

In the context of this thesis, we focus on the case study of a water utility company as these entities are under increasing economic and environmental pressures to optimise their infrastructure, in order to save energy, mitigate extreme weather events, and prevent water pollution. One promising approach consists in using smart systems. However, a smart infrastructure requires reliable communication links which are difficult to provide. In particular, communication links that are distributed and geographically located in rural areas are highly affected by changing weather conditions, hence efficient control of these distributed hosts requires robust communications. Multiple communication transceivers are used to mitigate this issue and to enable nodes to switch to reliable links. Short-term link quality estimators are used to decide which link to use which often leads to the situation where a <b>link</b> <b>switch</b> is initiated which does not prove helpful in the long term. It is not beneficial to switch a link and associated routing for only a brief duration hence we conduct test bed experiments to better understand the relationships between the radio links and weather factors and use this body of data to devise a LQE that can use this data and then make a smart choice based on this data which reduces switching costs...|$|E

The hand is fast and accurate, {{but it is just}} turning a volume control. When the input signal reaches a level set by the Threshold control, the compressor begins to turn the signal down by an amount determined by the Ratio control. The DC 22 S, like most compressors, operates by making the loud signals quieter, but does not make the quiet parts louder. However, by keeping the loud signals under control, the entire system may be turned up when necessary to make the quiet parts louder. There {{is more than just a}} stereo compressor working here. The adjustable Gate is a downward expander, acting like a com-pressor running in reverse, making the quiet parts quieter. This is valuable in reducing system background noise. The Ratio is fixed at 2 : 1. When the signal drops below the set Threshold, the Gate Threshold indicator lights and the output level is reduced by 2 dB for every 1 dB the input signal level drops.
