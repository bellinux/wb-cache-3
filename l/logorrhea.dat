5000|$|<b>Logorrhea</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with pressure of speech, which is characterized by the [...] "flighty" [...] alternation from topic to topic by tenuous links such as rhyming or punning. <b>Logorrhea</b> is a symptom of an underlying illness, and should be treated by a medical professional.

5000|$|In psychology, <b>logorrhea</b> or {{logorrhoea}} (from Ancient Greek λόγος logos [...] "word" [...] and ῥέω rheo [...] "to flow") is {{a communication}} disorder, expressed by excessive wordiness with minor or sometimes incoherent talkativeness. <b>Logorrhea</b> is sometimes {{classified as a}} mental illness, resulting {{from a variety of}} psychiatric and neurological disorders including aphasia, localized cortical lesions in the thalamus, mania, or most typically in catatonic schizophrenia.|$|E

50|$|Examples of <b>logorrhea</b> {{might include}} talking or mumbling monotonously, either to others, {{or more likely}} to oneself. This may include the {{repetition}} of particular words or phrases, often incoherently. The causes of <b>logorrhea</b> remain poorly understood, but appear to be localized to frontal lobe structures known {{to be associated with}} language. As is the case, for example, in emotional lability {{in a wide variety of}} neurological conditions, other symptoms take priority in clinical management and research efforts. Other symptoms include excessive talking, words that avoid any logic or reason, words that may offend other people and random words which hearers may ascribe unintended meaning to.|$|E
50|$|Synonyms for verbosity, {{of varying}} flavors of the meaning, include wordiness, verbiage, prolixity, grandiloquence, garrulousness, expatiation, <b>logorrhea,</b> and sesquipedalianism. Corresponding {{adjectival}} forms are verbose, wordy, prolix, grandiloquent, garrulous, and logorrheic. Slang {{terms such as}} verbal diarrhea also refer to the practice.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{what these}} same critics {{acknowledged}} {{as the greatest}} achievement of the two novels was Franciss [...] "stylistics of mockery" [...] (retórica da esculhambação): his grammatically incorrect phrasing, polyglot vocabulary and confused mix between the erudite and the downright vulgar. In a pithy description, his was [...] "a messy (avacalhada), aggressive rhetoric, in itself {{a critique of the}} pompous <b>logorrhea</b> and mystification to Brazilian ruling elites". In a late critique, the scholar João Manuel dos Santos Cunha would say that it was Francis own <b>logorrhea</b> in these novels which functioned as a [...] "rape" [...] of journalistic language that made clear his forswearing of any pretense at objectivity in order to allow him to build [...] "a dirty language for a dirty time".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Logorrhea</b> or {{logorrhoea}} (from Greek λογόρροια, logorrhoia, [...] "word-flux") is {{an excessive}} flow of words. It {{is often used}} pejoratively to describe prose {{that is hard to}} understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.|$|E
5000|$|Circumstantial {{speech is}} more direct than {{tangential}} {{speech in which}} the speaker wanders and drifts (in order to add more thought vectors in unrelated hyperplanes) and usually never returns to the original topic, and is far less severe than <b>logorrhea.</b> A helpful metaphor is traveling to a destination. If someone is thinking and speaking linearly, then they will {{go directly to the}} point. Circumstantial speech is more like taking [...] "unnecessary" [...] detours, according to some, but the speaker eventually arrives at the intended destination. In tangential speech, the speaker simply gets lost along the way, never returning to the original topic of conversation. With <b>logorrhea,</b> which is closer to word salad, it may not even be clear that the speaker had a particular idea or point in the first place.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{psychopathology}} he conducted studies of delusions, hallucinations and pseudohallucinations, providing a detailed nosology of these phenomena. He did extensive research of language {{and its relationship to}} mental illness. Here, he described linguistic traits such as <b>logorrhea,</b> embolalia, near-mutism, automatic speech, alexia, agraphia, et al.; and how these behaviors take shape and interact in various psychiatric disorders.|$|E
50|$|Tangential {{speech is}} a {{communication}} disorder {{in which the}} train of thought of the speaker wanders and shows a lack of focus, never returning to the initial topic of the conversation. It is less severe than <b>logorrhea</b> and {{may be associated with}} the middle stage in dementia. It is, however, more severe than circumstantial speech in which the speaker wanders, but eventually returns to the topic.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Klima {{edited the}} {{anthology}} <b>Logorrhea,</b> {{an anthology of}} twenty-one short stories, each of {{which was based on}} a different winning word from the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The anthology was nominated for a World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology. Theodora Goss's story from the anthology [...] "The Singing of Mount Abora" [...] won the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction. He also edited a reprint anthology of fairy tale retellings called Happily Ever After that was published by Night Shade Books in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Great Bores of Today was {{a long-running}} series in Private Eye. Each {{has a single}} frame, in which some {{immediately}} recognizable species of modern cultural bore is seen {{in his or her}} natural environs, haranguing bystanders, reporters, the viewer, or imagined listeners. Underneath is a lengthy chunk of the <b>logorrhea</b> that the bore utters distinguished in particular by the bland inconsistency of the bore's opinions. (The text is contributed by other Private Eye regulars.) The series has been resurrected in Richard Ingram's monthly magazine, The Oldie, with illustrations again by Heath.|$|E
50|$|The Québécois {{stand up}} comic Louis-José Houde has a minor {{supporting}} {{role in the}} film, playing Jeff, the coroner in charge of explaining {{the causes of the}} death of the first victim. In a truculent monologue very typical of his type of swift verbal humour, Houde delivers his diagnosis. Martin Ward understands only half of this verbal <b>logorrhea,</b> partly delivered in joual, but is reassured when Bouchard tells him that he too understood only half of it (due in his case to the technical jargon) and that hopefully their halves are not the same half.|$|E
50|$|One {{morning a}} doctor takes his son—an idealistic student {{of science and}} rationality—on his daily rounds through the grim mountainous Austrian countryside. They observe the rural grotesques they encounter—from an innkeeper whose wife has been murdered to a {{crippled}} musical prodigy kept in a cage—coping with physical misery, madness, and the brutality of the austere landscape. But when they meet the insomniac Prince Saurau in his castle at Hochgobernitz, his solitary, stationary mind takes {{over the rest of}} the novel in an uninterrupted obsessive paragraph. It's a hundred-page monologue by an eccentric, paranoid man, a relentlessly flowing cascade of words that is classic Bernhard: the furious <b>logorrhea</b> is a mesmeric rant, completing the stylistic formation of his art of exaggeration, where he uses metaphors of physical and mental illness to explore the decay of his homeland.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. Bennet is {{distinguished}} primarily by her propensity to <b>logorrhea,</b> a defect that Thomas Gisborne considers specifically feminine. She does {{not listen to}} any advice, especially if it comes from Elizabeth (who she does not like), makes redundant and repetitive speeches, annoying chattering, full of absurdities and inconsistencies, which she accompanies, when she is thwarted, with complaints back loop and continual cantankerous remarks that her interlocutors are careful not to interrupt, knowing that it would only serve to prolong them. Even the ever-patient Jane finds her mother's complaints hard to bear, when Mrs. Bennet manifests [...] "a longer irritation than usual" [...] about the absence of Mr. Bingley, confessing to Elizabeth how much the lack of self-control of her mother revives her suffering ("Oh that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can {{have no idea of}} the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him").|$|E
5000|$|Worm Quartet is {{a one-man}} (Timothy F. Crist, A.K.A. -=ShoEboX=-) Comedy Synth Punk band portrayed on album covers {{as a group}} of four worms. The [...] "band" [...] has a growing cult {{following}} thanks to exposure on the Dr. Demento show. Worm Quartet's music, all written by Crist, is characterized by wild <b>logorrhea,</b> taking words that might never have been in the same sentence before and forming odd images that flash past the listener's ears but remain imprinted on their engrams. His sophomoric sense of humor is occasionally tempered by outrage or satirical criticism. Worm Quartet had the #1 Most Requested Song of the Year on the Dr. Demento Show in 2004 (Great Idea For A Song) and 2005 (Inner Voice with Sudden Death). He has additionally collaborated with Rob Balder under the name [...] "Baldbox" [...] to release one CD ("The Dumb Album") and several follow-up songs, which have also been played frequently by Dr. Demento and other terrestrial radio shows.|$|E

40|$|A common {{assumption}} regarding fluency is {{that the}} difference between a fluent and non-fluent speaker can be easily stated (Poeck, 1989; Gordon, 1998). However, there is no objective and valid measure to determinate the level of a person with aphasia on the fluency continuum. Traditionally, people with aphasia have been classified as fluent or non-fluent following the cognitive criteria. In ecologycal data we find that 7, 3 words-per-turn value is a valid measure in Spanish and Catalan to delimit fluent and non-fluent speakers. These results emphasize the importance of the quantitative analysis of fluency in speech in its natural environment. As well, the measure of 7, 3 words-per-turn not only can determinate the difference between fluent and non-fluent speaker, but allows the diagnosis of severe fluency deficits as <b>logorrhea</b> or mutism...|$|E
40|$|Background: Psychosis has various causes, {{including}} mania and schizophrenia. Since {{the differential}} diagnosis of psychosis is exclusively based on subjective assessments of oral interviews with patients, an objective quantification of the speech disturbances that characterize mania and schizophrenia is in order. In principle, such quantification could be achieved by the analysis of speech graphs. A graph represents a network with nodes connected by edges; in speech graphs, nodes correspond to words and edges correspond to semantic and grammatical relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings: To quantify speech differences related to psychosis, interviews with schizophrenics, manics and normal subjects were recorded and represented as graphs. Manics {{scored significantly higher than}} schizophrenics in ten graph measures. Psychopathological symptoms such as <b>logorrhea,</b> poor speech, and flight of thoughts were grasped by the analysis even when verbosity differences were discounted. Binary classifiers based on speech graph measures sorted schizophrenics from manics with up to 93. 8 % of sensitivity and 93. 7 % of specificity. In contrast, sorting based on the scores of two standard psychiatric scales (BPRS and PANSS) reached only 62. 5 % of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrate that alterations of the thought process manifested in the speech o...|$|E
40|$|I {{completed}} this dissertation with the substantial contribution of many outstanding people. Richard Burt, my committee chair, was an ideal example of academic generosity. When I needed help {{after a series}} of personal and medical crises, he provided understanding and encouragement. Richard also profoundly transformed my understanding of the relationship between literature, politics, and film. I can only hope that if literary studies is truly ruined, its post-apocalyptic fallout won’t prevent me from impacting my students in the way Richard has inspired me. My cochair, Donald Ault, was the primary reason I came to the University of Florida. His work on William Blake and his courage to promote the academic study of comic books made my scholarly career possible. He has also infected me, perhaps fatally, with a love of <b>logorrhea</b> that will always be a hallmark of my teaching and scholarship. John Leavey provided both theoretical rigor and critique and, as a consequence, made me a better scholar and thinker. Robert Hatch contributed a nuanced approach to historicism and an interest in the fictional appropriation of historical figures that proved essential to the project. Terry Harpold, Kenneth Kidd, Ron Broglio, and Judith Paige all provided insightful suggestions for this project. I {{would also like to thank}} the members of the NASSR-L listserv who introduced me t...|$|E
