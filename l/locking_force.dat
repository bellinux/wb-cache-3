The drivers can select from three different driving modes, [...] "Tarmac", [...] "Gravel" [...] and [...] "Snow", and the car's computer system relatively promotes the active center differential to change the differential locking which, despite popular belief, {{does not change the}} torque split. The differential is geared at 50:50 and cannot be changed by the push of a button. What this switch actually does is quite simple. Each setting determines how long the ACD will delay in freeing the center differential after a steering input is made. In addition, it will determine how much <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> the ACD will exhibit on the clutch pack and center differential.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of pressure distribution within the fluid film in the clearance between spool and sleeve of hydraulic components, in order to predict {{the value of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> induced by unbalanced pressure acting on tapered geometries. Particular care is devoted to the investigation of the lateral force dependency on clearance and eccentricity of the spool. Some theoretical results are presented, obtained solving (by the finite difference method) the two dimensional Reynolds equation for the fluid film. These results are then compared to those deriving from a generally adopted predictive formula. Results show remarkable differences, up to 70 %, in presence of high values of eccentricity. Moreover, an analogous Reynolds' based solution is performed for a tapered geometry of the spool with one balancing groove, with particular attention to the influence of its length and position on resulting <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> and leakage flow. Also the <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> reducing effect of a balancing groove is characterized, and a saturated behavior when the groove is placed very close to the high pressure spool side has been found...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Steering {{mechanism}} {{is an important}} part of car driving system and the <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> is a key parameter to protect driver in the case of a frontal impact. But it is difficult to predict the range of <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> during impact since the material properties and friction of the system are variable in a certain range. Based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and monomial cubature rules (MCRs), an efficient robust design method is presented to predict the <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> of a steering mechanism and select appropriate parameters for structure design. The advantage of the method is to reduce the intensive computational demand of uncertainty propagation by construction of PCE using points of MCRs, and the accuracy is enough for engineering problems...|$|R

Summaries of key findings, with reference to focus area, methods and results, are included in this abstractMagnetic <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> 28 physical tests were performed with the intention to investigate the magnetic <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> connection between the magnetic sled and PIG using two PIG concepts. This resulted in an axial magnetic <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> of 1719 N for the passive PIG, and 2655 N for the active PIG concept. The results of the analysis study performed in the Project Thesis, written the autumn of 2012 [1], showed that the passive- and active PIG potentially produce a <b>lock</b> <b>force</b> of 1801 N and 3938 N respectively. The result of the analysis study and the physical tests {{were found to be}} especially similar for the passive PIG concept. Wax layer removal 32 physical tests were performed with the intention to investigate the cleaning efficiency and scraper resistance of the seven tested scraper designs. A 1 mm paraffin-wax-based deposition layer was added to all test pipes. The scraper resistance results were found to be in the range of 90 N ? 1200 N with equally large variations in cleaning efficiency. Compared to the magnitude of the magnetic <b>lock</b> <b>forces,</b> the scraper resistance was not considered to be an issue. Full system testingA flow loop was designed and built in order to directly investigate if a 1 mm wax deposition layer could be removed using only the magnetic connection between the magnetic sled and PIG.

40|$|Screw {{fasteners}} {{are undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most important machine elements due to their outstanding characteristic to provide a high clamping force just with a simplified design. However, the loosen vibration is their inherent and inevitable fault. The friction locking approach is one of the basic locking fastener categories by enhancing the bearing load on the contact surface of thread by applying a <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> on an antiloosening nut. This <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> may cause more severe deformation in the nut. The contact stress distribution on the nut would be changed and that can cause the variation of the friction torque for the bolt joint. However, there exists no established design calculation procedure that accounts for the rotation deformation and its stiffness of the antiloosening nut under the <b>locking</b> <b>force.</b> The main objective of the work is to develop an analytical solution to the rotation deformation problem encountered in the antiloosening nut. The proposed model is supported by comparison with numerical finite element analysis of different sizes of joint elements and different applied forces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} on the inuence of geometrical characteristics on the <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> acting on spools in tapered clearances exposed to decentralizing pressure drops. An estimation is presented of the diVerent results in <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> prediction deriving from the comparison of the ‘classical ’ one-dimensional approach of ow and a more complex description represented by the Reynolds equation. A sensitivity analysis on the inuence of clearance geometrical parameters is performed, showing the limits of application of the one-dimensional approach. Two non-dimensional geometric variables are identied, which can be adopted to dene some polynomial corrective func-tions correlating one-dimensional results with more reliable two-dimensional solutions. The determi-nation of the <b>locking</b> <b>force</b> can therefore be performed by an analytical process, involving the ‘classical’ one-dimensional solution and a polynomial correction which is a simple two-variable function of the clearance geometry. In comparison with results coming from the direct solution of the Reynolds equation, the process leads to errors conned {{within the range of}} a few per cent, considering clearances in a wide dimensional range representing a large amount of couplings actually encountered in hydraulic spool valves...|$|E

The monitoring results showed the high sensitivity and high reliability of this monitoring system. This application provides a long-term and on-line detecting method which could meet railway switch condition monitoring demands of more than 100, 000 switch machines in the country.|$|E
40|$|A new {{nonlinear}} beam-column element {{capable of}} considering the shear deformation is proposed under {{the concept of}} consistent deformation. For the traditional displacement interpolation function, the beam-column element produces membrane locking under large deformation and shear locking when the element becomes slender. To eliminate the membrane and shear <b>locking,</b> <b>force</b> equilibrium equations are employed to derive the displacement function. Numerical examples herein show that membrane locking in the traditional nonlinear beam-column element could cause a considerable error. Comparison of the present improved formulae based on the Timoshenko beam theory with that based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory indicates that the present approach requires several additional parameters to consider shear deformation and it is suitable for computer analysis readily for incorporation into the frames analysis software using the co-rotational approach for large translations and rotations. The examples confirm that the proposed element has higher accuracy and numerical efficiency. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
