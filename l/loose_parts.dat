2500|$|In addition, if a {{baseball}} batter is struck with a pitch, he is awarded first base; [...] "hitting" [...] the batter includes hitting <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> of his uniform without hitting his body (baseball rules specify that a player's person includes his uniform and equipment {{except for his}} bat). Pitchers may throw close to the batters, and a [...] "brushback" [...] is often used as an intimidation tactic. Deliberately hitting a batter is fairly uncommon, however, chiefly because it is punished severely. If the umpire believes a batter was intentionally hit, the umpire has his discretion on a first offence to warn both benches that the pitcher for either team will be expelled from the game {{if there are any}} further hit batsmen (the one baseball term in which [...] "batsman" [...] is used). The warning—and the power to expel if it is contravened—is intended not only to protect batters but to avert fighting; being hit by a fastball is taken seriously by batters, and bench-clearing brawls occasionally result when one team decides the other is deliberately throwing at its batters. Amazingly, {{in the history of the}} major league game, only one player has ever been killed by a pitched ball striking him in the head (Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians in 1920). This occurred before the invention of the batting helmet and was the principal cause for introducing this piece of equipment into the game as well as replacing dirty balls and outlawing the spitball.|$|E
60|$|The near {{relation}} {{that there}} is between SPECIES, ESSENCES, and their GENERAL NAME, at least in mixed modes, will further appear when we consider, {{that it is the}} name that seems to preserve those essences, and give them their lasting duration. For, the connexion between the <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> of those complex ideas being made by the mind, this union, which has no particular foundation in nature, would cease again, were there not something that did, as it were, hold it together, and keep the parts from scattering. Though therefore it be the mind that makes the collection, it is the name which is as it were the knot that ties them fast together. What a vast variety of different ideas does the word TRIUMPHUS hold together, and deliver to us as one species! Had this name been never made, or quite lost, we might, no doubt, have had descriptions of what passed in that solemnity: but yet, I think, that which holds those different parts together, in the unity of one complex idea, is that very word annexed to it; without which the several parts of that would no more be thought to make one thing, than any other show, which having never been made but once, had never been united into one complex idea, under one denomination. How much, therefore, in mixed modes, the unity necessary to any essence depends on the mind; and how much the continuation and fixing of that unity depends on the name in common use annexed to it, I leave to be considered by those who look upon essences and species as real established things in nature.|$|E

40|$|Loosening of a {{rotating}} part from its fixed {{position on the}} shaft or {{a part of the}} stator which comes loose and begins to turn with the rotor very frequently represents machinery malfunction. The <b>loose</b> <b>part</b> becomes involved in rotative motion mostly due to dry or fluid friction, and thus its motion is very erratic. The <b>loose</b> <b>part</b> can also move axially along the shaft. Detachment of the rotating part causes changes in the rotor balance state. Most often this results in higher unbalance. During steady-state operation the effect of a <b>loose</b> rotating <b>part</b> can manifest itself through heat vibration. It can be diagnosed by observing periodic changes of amplitude and phase of the synchronous response. During start-up (or shutdown) a <b>loose</b> rotating <b>part</b> carrying some amount of unbalance may manifest its dynamic action in the form of subsynchronous vibrations, very similar to those of other instabilities. The objective of this demonstration is to observe the effect of a <b>loose</b> rotating <b>part</b> (fixed, however, in the axial direction) under both steady-state (rotor constant speed) and transient (rotor start-up or shutdown) operation. The dynamic response depends very much on the amount of damping in the system: lubrication of the loose part/shaft surfaces and addition/elimination of aerodynamic drag blades, mounted on the loose disk, significantly change the rotor response...|$|R
