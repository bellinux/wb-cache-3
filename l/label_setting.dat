40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptation}} of the recently proposed graph-shifts algorithm for labeling MRF problems from low-level vision. Graph-shifts is an energy minimization algorithm that does labeling by dynamically manipulating, or shifting, the parent-child relationships in a hierarchical decomposition of the image. Graph-shifts was originally proposed for labeling using relatively small <b>label</b> <b>sets</b> (e. g., 9) for problems in high-level vision. In the low-level vision problems we consider, there are much larger <b>label</b> <b>sets</b> (e. g., 256).

We propose four improvements to the graph-shifts representation and algorithm that make it suitable for doing labeling on these large <b>label</b> <b>sets.</b> We implement and test the algorithm on two low-level vision problems: image restoration and stereo. Our results demonstrate the potential for such a hierarchical energy minimization algorithm on low-level vision problems with large <b>label</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceMulti-objective Shortest Path problem {{consists}} in finding Pareto-optimal paths between two given nodes in a graph where each edge has several associated costs, while minimizing several objectives. To solve this multi-objective problem, we {{develop a new}} exact method called <b>Label</b> <b>Setting</b> algorithm with Dynamic update of Pareto Front (LSDPF), which aims to find all non-dominated solutions of the problem.

40|$|<b>Label</b> <b>setting</b> {{techniques}} are {{all based on}} Dijkstra's condition of always scanning the node with the minimum label, which guarantees that each node will be scanned exactly once; while this condition is sufficient it is not necessary. In this paper, we discuss less restrictive conditions that allow the scanning of a node {{that does not have}} the minimum label, yet still maintaining sufficiency in scanning each node exactly once; various potential shortest path schemes are discussed, based on these conditions. Two approaches, a <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> and a flexible hybrid one are designed and implemented. The performance of the algorithms is assessed both theoretically and computationally. For comparative analysis purposes, three additional shortest path algorithms - the commonly cited in the literature - are coded and tested.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{labeling}} algorithm for the shortest path problem with time windows (SPPTW). It is generalized from the threshold algorithm for the unconstrained shortest path problem. Our computational experiments show that this generalized threshold algorithm outperforms a <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> algorithm for the SPPTW {{on a set of}} randomly generated test problems. The average running time of the new algorithm is about 40 % less than the <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> algorithm, which istoday the best algorithm based on published experimental evidence. 1 The shortest path problem with time windows (SPPTW) is a generalization of the classical (unconstrained) shortest path problem (SPP) involving the added complexity of time windows. The SPPTW can be described as follows. Let G =(V�A) be a directed graph where V = N [fp � qg is the set of nodes with source node p and sink node q, A is the set of arcs.

30|$|In general, {{there are}} mainly two {{algorithmic}} approaches {{to deal with}} the shortest path problem, namely <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> and label correcting algorithm [17]. Both approaches iteratively update the label cost of nodes at each step. The label cost of nodes is designated as permanent in the <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> algorithm at each iteration, while the label correcting algorithm can change the label cost of nodes at any step. This feature determines that <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> algorithm cannot solve the shortest path problem with negative arc costs, but the label correcting algorithm can deal with the shortest path problem with arbitrary arc costs. The static shortest path problem can be further extended to dynamic version with time-dependent arc costs c_i,j,t on link (i, j) for vehicles leaving at time t, and time-dependent link travel time TTi,j,t. Ziliaskopoulos and Mahmassani [18] proposed an efficient label correcting-based algorithm to find the time-dependent shortest paths from all nodes in the network to the single destination node. Chabini [19] aims to reduce the worst-case complexity in solving the time-dependent shortest path problem by adopting the dynamic programming approach. Recently, the shortest path problem in three-dimensional networks or hyper-networks has attracted significant interests in transportation optimization problems. Mahmoudi and Zhou [20] developed a time-dependent forward dynamic programming algorithm to reformulate the VRPPD as a special version of the shortest path problem with time-dependent and state-dependent arc costs where the state represents the number of passengers on the vehicle. Liu et al. [21] further considered an extended version of household activity scheduling problem by using a cumulative space–time–state representation {{to reduce the number of}} complex constraints. A space–time–speed hyper-network and the corresponding dynamic programming algorithm are introduced by Zhou et al. [22] with applications in joint optimization of train timetables and speed profiles. A resource-space–time network was adapted by Lu et al. [23] to consider time-dependent routing applications with energy resource considerations. As an alternative representation to the high-dimension network, a decomposition approach is considered by Tong et al. [14] and Ruan et al. [24] with two coupled subproblems, i.e., a space–time network-based shortest path problem and a general assignment problem, for customized bus applications. By extending the space–time network-based time-dependent shortest path algorithms, this VRPLite package aims to solve the time-dependent and state-dependent shortest path problem. As a particular note, the cumulative service state of passengers is presented as the “state” dimension in the VRPLite package.|$|E

First, we extend an algorithm of Bertsimas and Sim (2003) for the single-objective problem to multi-objective optimization.

Second, we introduce a deterministic multi-objective problem with sum and bottleneck functions, which provides a superset of the robust efficient solutions. Based on this, we develop a <b>label</b> <b>setting</b> algorithm to solve the multi-objective uncertain shortest path problem.
