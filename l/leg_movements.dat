25|$|The {{system is}} said by Rossy {{to be highly}} {{responsive}} and reactive in flight, {{to the point where}} he needs to closely control his head, arm and <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> to avoid an uncontrolled spin. The engines on the wing must be aligned precisely during set-up, also to prevent instability. An electronic starter system ensures that all four engines ignite simultaneously. In the event of a spin, the wing unit can be detached from the pilot, and pilot and wing unit descend to Earth separately, each with a parachute.|$|E
25|$|Polysomnography is {{performed}} in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably {{at his or her}} usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.|$|E
40|$|Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is {{associated}} with a ∼ 3 -fold increase in blood flow to the leg but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the role of nitric oxide (NO) for the hyperaemia observed during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>Leg</b> haemodynamics and metabolites of NO production (nitrite and nitrate; NOx) were measured in plasma and muscle interstitial fluid at rest and during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> with and without inhibition of NO formation in healthy young males. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and to ACh was also assessed in elderly subjects and patients with peripheral artery disease. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (60 r. p. m.) increased leg blood flow from 0. 3 ± 0. 1 to 0. 9 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 20 s and 0. 5 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 3 min (P < 0. 05). Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged during the trial. When passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> was performed during inhibition of NO formation (NG-mono-methyl-l-arginine; 29 – 52 mg min− 1), leg blood flow and vascular conductance were increased after 20 s (P < 0. 05) and then returned to baseline levels, despite an increase in arterial pressure (P < 0. 05). Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> increased the femoral venous NOx levels from 35 ± 5 at baseline to 62 ± 11 μmol l− 1 during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (P < 0. 05), whereas muscle interstitial NOx levels remained unchanged. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> were correlated with the vasodilatation induced by ACh (r 2 = 0. 704, P < 0. 001) and with age (r 2 = 0. 612, P < 0. 001). Leg blood flow did not increase during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in individuals with peripheral arterial disease. These results suggest that the hypaeremia induced by passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is NO dependent and that the source of NO is likely to be the endothelium. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> could therefore be used as a non-invasive tool to evaluate NO dependent endothelial function of the lower limb...|$|R

25|$|However, {{the desert}} tribes' {{relationship}} with the Romans was not exclusively hostile. The {{other side of the}} coin is that many volunteered to serve in the Roman army, in both the regular auxilia and irregular native foederati (allied) units (although conscription was still common at this time - and was another cause of discontent). The army provided the prospect of a well-paid career which gave scope for the tribesmen's martial nature, which was highly regarded by the Romans. Numidian cavalry (equites Numidarum or Maurorum), which had played a prominent role in Roman armies since the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), were regarded as the best light cavalry in the Roman world. A Numidian cavalryman rode his small but agile and resilient desert mount without bridle, saddle or stirrups, restraining it by a loose rope round its neck and directing it by <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and voice commands. Unarmoured, he was protected by just a small round leather shield. His weaponry consisted of several javelins. Exceptionally fast and manoeuvrable, Numidian cavalry would harass the enemy by hit-and-run attacks, riding up and loosing volleys of javelins, then scattering and retreating faster than any opposing cavalry could pursue. They were superbly suited to scouting, harassment, ambush and pursuit. Numidian foot soldiers were also predominantly light infantry, relying on speed and manoeuvrability. However, both Numidian foot and mounted warriors were vulnerable in close-order combat with Roman troops, who mainly wore metal armour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is {{an injury}} to the spinal cord that results in {{paralysis}} and loss of sensation. Successful recovery depends upon how well these chronic conditions are handled day to day. SCI people have very often periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and severe spasm. Both are serious problems in the SCI population which is not always managed effectively. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that the syndrome can have various presentations, each with their own specific etiology. Hence this paper presents the overview of analysis of spasm and periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in spinal cord injured persons using electro-myogram signals. There is a need for better understanding the syndrome of periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and spasticity in SCI persons. So, the main purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated source of information that reflects the most useful knowledge about the main problems of SCI like periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and severe spasm from different perspectives...|$|R

2500|$|Irish dance can broadly {{be divided}} into social dance and {{performance}} dance. Irish social dance can {{be divided into}} céilí and set dancing. Irish set dances are quadrilles, danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while céilí dances are danced by varied formations of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as stepdance. Irish stepdance, popularised by the show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in [...] "soft shoe" [...] or [...] "hard shoe".|$|E
2500|$|Yotoriyama has {{described}} the game's concept as expressing [...] "fun and diversity in weapon combat", citing the contrast in how one weapon would affect gameplay compared to another and how they would react to each other upon clashing.

He described the availability of movement in comparison to Tekken 3 as a large contrast between the two series and more tactical and emphasized how it interacted with the game's [...] "ring out" [...] feature. Each character in Soulcalibur was designed around the idea that they could be viewed as a real person could, and to this end, motion creator Masataka Ishiguro emphasized the arm and <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> for each character in relation to their weapon, wanting players to [...] "feel the individual motions and the realism within the game" ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that sleep bruxism is caused by mechanisms related to the central nervous system, involving sleep arousal and neurotransmitter abnormalities. Underlying these factors may be psychosocial factors including daytime stress which is disrupting peaceful sleep. Sleep bruxism is mainly characterized by [...] "rhythmic masticatory muscle activity" [...] (RMMA) at a frequency of about once per second, and also with occasional tooth grinding. It {{has been shown that}} the majority (86%) of sleep bruxism episodes occur during periods of sleep arousal. One study reported that sleep arousals which were experimentally induced with sensory stimulation in sleeping bruxists triggered episodes of sleep bruxism. Sleep arousals are a sudden change in the depth of the sleep stage, and may also be accompanied by increased heart rate, respiratory changes and muscular activity, such as <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Initial reports have suggested that episodes of sleep bruxism may be accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux, decreased esophageal pH (acidity), swallowing, and decreased salivary flow. Another report suggested a link between episodes of sleep bruxism and a supine sleeping position (lying face up).|$|E
50|$|Individuals with {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} have increased numbers of K-complexes and these are associated with (and often precede) <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Dopamine enhancing drugs such as L-DOPA that reduce <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> do not reduce the K-complex suggesting that they are primary and the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> secondary to them. Failure of such drugs to reduce K-complexes in spite of reducing the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> has been suggested to be why patients after such treatment still continue to complain of non-restorative sleep. Clonazepam is another treatment for RLS; like other benzodiazepines, it inhibits REM sleep by enhancing levels of GABA. This inhibition of REM sleep significantly decreases K-complex count, and unlike L-DOPA treatment, clonazepam studies report improvement in sleep restoration. Therefore, drugs that inhibit REM sleep also decrease K-complex count.|$|E
