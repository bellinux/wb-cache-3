6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] {{the officer}} who was {{standing}} by him answered. [...] "You were pretty near frozen to death. Luckily your <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> kept you from taking in any water, {{but it was a}} near squeak. Another three minutes in the water, and the doctor says it would have been all up with you." ...|$|E
60|$|Pleasant, was it not? It was not. I {{began to}} {{understand}} what a shipwrecked sailor must feel when he finds there's something gone wrong with the <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the horse}} <b>Life</b> <b>Belt</b> is disqualified {{for a drug}} violation, trainer Dan Morgan is {{suspended}} from horse racing. He goes {{to work in a}} lesser role for June and Jimmy Curtis at their stables and tends to Color Sergeant, an injured horse.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh get her out! Oh Di, DARLING! Oh get her out! Oh Daddy, Oh Daddy!' moaned the child's voice, in distraction. Somebody {{was in the}} water, with a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> Two boats paddled near, their {{lanterns}} swinging ineffectually, {{the boats}} nosing round.|$|R
60|$|Both boys now {{took off}} their coats and waistcoats, {{put on a}} warm flannel jersey over their flannel shirts, and then wound the {{bandages}} of India rubber round each other's bodies. They began under the arms; drawing the webbing tight, as they wound it round, so that its natural elasticity caused each turn to press tightly upon the turn above, which it overlapped. This bandage was continued down to {{the lower part of}} the body. Then they put on the <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> Over them they put their suits of white calico, white shoes with India rubber soles, the white caps, and swimming gloves.|$|E
60|$|Julian {{started on}} his {{adventure}} without any particular enthusiasm. He found the crossing, returned {{along the side}} of the bank, trudged along the cart track until he arrived at the gate, and climbed up on the dyke without misadventure. From here he made his way more cautiously, using his stick with his right hand, his torch, with his thumb upon the knob, in his left. The lull in the storm seemed to be at an end. Black, low-hanging clouds were closing in upon him. Away to the right, where the line of marshes was unbroken, the boom of the wind grew louder. A gust very nearly blew him down the bank. He was compelled to shelter for a moment on its lee side, whilst a scud of snow and sleet passed like an icy whirlwind. The roar of the sea was full in his ears now, and though he must still have been fully two hundred yards away from it, little ghostly specks of white spray were dashed, every now and then, into his face. From here he made his way with great care, almost crawling, until he came to the stile. In the marshes he was twice in salt water over his knees, but he scrambled out until he reached the grass-grown sand bank which Furley had indicated. Obeying orders, he lay down and listened intently for any fainter sounds mingled with the tumult of nature. After a few minutes, it was astonishing how his eyes found themselves able to penetrate the darkness which at first had seemed like a black wall. Some distance to the right he could make out the outline of a deserted barn, once used as a coast-guard station and now only a depository for the storing of <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> In front of him he could trace the bank of shingle and the line of the sea, and presently the outline of some dark object, lying just out of reach of the breaking waves, attracted his attention. He watched it steadily. For some time it was as motionless as the log he presumed it to be. Then, without any warning, it hunched itself up and drew a little farther back. There was no longer any doubt. It was a human being, lying on its stomach with its head turned to the sea.|$|E
50|$|Anti-flash gear may be {{accompanied}} by other protective gear, such as <b>life</b> <b>belts,</b> helmets, gas masks, etc. While it may be worn by first-response fire-fighting parties, regular shipboard fire-fighters will usually wear full protective gear similar to civilian fire fighters.|$|E
2500|$|A {{personal}} {{flotation device}} (abbreviated as PFD; {{also referred to}} as a life jacket, <b>life</b> preserver, <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> Mae West, <b>life</b> vest, life saver, cork jacket, buoyancy aid or [...] flotation suit) is a piece of equipment designed to assist a wearer to keep afloat in water. The wearer may be either conscious or unconscious.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of timing belts {{is the need}} for regular replacement of the <b>belt.</b> Recommended <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> varies between designs; belts made from neoprene for older vehicles might have a recommended life of around 20000 mi while newer designs with lower torque loading and made from hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) may have a recommended life of 60000 mi or more. By 2004, the range for timing <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> for new engine designs was 60000 - 100000 mi, with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection. Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce <b>belt</b> <b>life.</b> Timing <b>belts</b> are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the main}} focus of the {{galleries}} is on arts, craft and wares, including exhibits on: Irish coins and currency, silverware, furniture, folklife and costumes, ceramics, glassware, etc. Included are artefacts such as Etruscan vases, gauntlets worn by King William at Battle of the Boyne, a <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> and oar salvaged from the wreck of the RMS Lusitania and a pocket book carried by Wolfe Tone whilst imprisoned in the Barracks.

50|$|For World War II, {{the company}} was again called upon to supply vast {{quantities}} of wellington and thigh boots. 80% of production was for war materials - from ground sheets to <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and gas masks. In the Netherlands, forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and tight boots in vast supplies.|$|E

Also three life vests were sighted, two of them by Starlight and another one by Evelyn.|$|E
50|$|He started 1928 with {{wins over}} George Rose, Auguste Gyde, and another defeat of Hyams in a title eliminator, before facing Ernie Rice in September for the British {{lightweight}} title vacated by Harry Mason, with Steward's Sporting <b>Life</b> <b>belt</b> also at stake. Steward knocked Rice {{out in the}} twelfth round to become British champion. He rounded off the year with a draw against former French champion Lucien Vinez and a win over future Dutch champion Jan Scheffers.|$|R
60|$|There {{was just}} one moment, the moment in which, on {{going down to the}} junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was boisterously greeted by a {{vermilion}} bull terrier, when Mr. Downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. Glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 39 voyages between Adelaide and Melbourne {{there had}} never been cause for alarm aboard Admella. Never any need for life boats or <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> The vessel's only captain, Hugh McEwan was a {{cautious}} and capable master mariner. Admella had been built with watertight bulkheads, riveted to the hull. These were designed as a special safety feature, but were ultimately the cause of a catastrophic break up of the ship into three exposed sections in the first 15 minutes of the disaster.|$|E
50|$|While Wheeling {{had been}} engaged in hunting U-39 and in {{collecting}} the scattered convoy, UB-50 joined the fracas. At about 2016, the American warship witnessed a flash, then heard a report, to her port side, as UB-50s torpedo slammed into SS Mavisbrook. The gunboat stopped her engines and began rescue operations. Over the side went two Franklin life buoys, two balsam rafts, and a dozen <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> Just as she prepared to lower one of her boats to continue rescue duty, Surveyor appeared on the scene, assumed rescue duty, and released Wheeling to resume protection and collection of the convoy.|$|E
25|$|A nonprofessional {{performer}} named Richard Lacovara doubled for Basehart in long {{shots on}} the ledge, {{which had been}} enlarged to minimize risk of falling. Lacovara was protected by a canvas <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> hidden under his costume, connected to a lifeline, Even with the double, Basehart still had to endure over 300 hours of standing on the ledge with little movement during the 50 days of shooting in New York, {{even though he had}} a sprained ankle and his legs were ravaged by poison oak contracted on the grounds of his Coldwater Canyon home.|$|R
5000|$|A {{personal}} {{force field}} technology {{known as the}} <b>life</b> support <b>belt</b> was seen only in Star Trek: The Animated Series. In addition to supplying the wearer with the appropriate atmosphere and environmental protection, it permitted the animators to simply draw the belt and yellow glow around the existing characters, {{instead of having to}} redraw them with an environmental suit. A version of the <b>life</b> support <b>belt</b> later appeared in an early Star Trek: The Next Generation novel, The Peacekeepers, where they were referred to as [...] "field-effect suits".|$|R
5000|$|Zamyatin later recalled, [...] "In England, I built ships, {{looked at}} ruined castles, {{listened to the}} thud of bombs dropped by German zeppelins, and wrote The Islanders. I regret that I {{did not see the}} February Revolution, and know only the October Revolution (I {{returned}} to Petersburg, past German submarines, in a ship with lights out, wearing a <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> the whole time, just in time for October). This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so.." ...|$|R
50|$|The Corporation of Glasgow who had {{organised}} {{the tournament}} {{and provided the}} cup named after Glasgow's patron saint as their donation to the Festival of Britain were left red faced when the triumphant players and manager Jimmy McGrory discovered, on closer examination, that the cup was decorated with ornate <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and mermaids. It was revealed that the trophy was not in fact new but third hand. The cup {{had been made in}} 1894 as a yachting trophy. In 1912 it had been altered for a football competition between Provan Gasworks and a City of Glasgow Police team.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{hearing that}} Hood had sunk, Electra {{raced to the}} area, {{arriving}} about 2 hours after Hood went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 ratings aboard Hood, just three survivors were found. Electra rescued them, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in the search, and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.|$|E
50|$|According {{to his own}} account, all {{was smooth}} and quiet while he was {{sleeping}} in a bunk until one of the watchmen came down {{and said that they}} all had to put their <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> on and go up to the deck. Daniels then went up to deck and awaited orders along with other crew members. They received orders to get all the women and children up to the deck and into their lifeboats. When he finished his task, there was only one remaining lifeboat, which was a collapsible boat secured {{to the top of the}} wireless room and lashed down with varying lashings. Someone asked for a pocket knife and Daniels obliged.|$|E
25|$|Both cutters {{were kept}} swung out, {{hanging from the}} davits, ready for {{immediate}} use, while collapsible lifeboatsC and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters, on either side of number1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Huangpi, Hubei, {{he was the}} son of a Qing veteran of the Taiping Rebellion (黎朝相). He {{graduated}} from the Tianjin naval academy in 1889 and served as an engineer in the First Sino-Japanese war. His cruiser was sunk and he survived because of his <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> since he could not swim. He later joined the Hubei New Army and became senior military officer in Hankou. In 1910, he attempted to break up revolutionary rings that infiltrated his 21st Mixed Brigade. He did not arrest anyone caught in subversive activities, but simply dismissed them.|$|R
50|$|By stage 2 (day 1-2), {{penetration}} {{is complete}} and the flea has burrowed {{most of its}} body into the skin. Only the anus, the copulatory organs, and four rear air holes in fleas called stigmatas remain {{on the outside of}} the epidermis. The anus will excrete feces that is thought to attract male fleas for mating, described in a later section. The hypertrophic zone between tergites 2 and 3 in the abdominal region begins to expand a day or two after penetration and takes the appearance of a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> During this time, the flea begins to feed on the host’s blood.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{engineer}} advised the Captain that the Taiaroa was making water. <b>Life</b> <b>belts</b> were handed {{out to all}} the passengers and crew. An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a line ashore. The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait until light and then make for the beach. The boats were attached by lines astern but three soon capsized in the heavy sea. A rocket was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|E
50|$|Electra and {{the other}} destroyers were about 60 mi away at the time. Upon hearing that Hood had sunk, Electra raced to the area, {{arriving}} about two hours after Hood went under. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 enlisted men who were aboard Hood, only three survivors were found. Electra rescued these survivors, and continued searching.

After several hours searching, they left the area.|$|E
50|$|Once in New York, {{the couple}} was ordered {{to report to the}} Senate Board of Inquiry in Washington D.C. Helen Bishop testified first, stating that she was conversing with Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor prior to the ship's sinking, when Captain Smith came to speak to Mr. Astor. Astor told the group he was talking with to put on <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and go on deck. Once on deck, an officer took Mrs. Bishop by the arm and told her to quietly get into the lifeboat; after that, her husband was pushed into the boat with her. Helen Bishop said there were 12 women, 13 men and three crew members in the lifeboat; she {{continued}} by saying many {{of the men in the}} boat were not married.|$|E

5000|$|On 21 October, Seid was escorting Stoney Point to Espiritu Santo. At {{approximately}} 2000 hours, {{a message}} was received from Stoney Point stating {{that she had}} just passed {{a man in the}} water. Upon returning to the point and illuminating the area with search lights, it was discovered that the man floating in the water was attached to Seid. Though surrounded by sharks and supported only by a <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> the man was recovered uninjured. Upon questioning, it was learned that he had fallen asleep on the fantail and fell off the ship as she rolled.|$|R
60|$|Ralph, however, put {{one hand}} upon Percy's <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> and struck out for shore; but he {{felt that it was}} hopeless. Frightful pains were {{shooting}} through his limbs, and he breathed what he believed to be a last prayer; when a boom like thunder, a few yards off, galvanized him into life again--for he saw the gunboat, which they had seen in the morning, only a few yards distant. She had just fired a gun, loaded with grape, {{in the direction of the}} Germans who were firing. She was still at anchor, and the stream was drifting them down fast upon her.|$|R
