Additionally, financial constraints and a slump in the popularity of the game in the 1980s and 1990s had impacted the development of the national team in Bhutan, as well as the fact that the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> in the country had prevented the team attempting to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.|$|E

Williams believes that in terms of the financial returns for athletes he actively helped move the sport from the amateur to the professional world - from an amateur world that had led earlier sprinting greats like Jesse Owens and Bob Hayes to leave the sport prematurely to the professional world where athletes, like Carl Lewis as one example, could achieve a financially lucrative career and so stay in the sport.|$|E

50|$|Futsal is {{very much}} in an {{embryonic}} stage of development in Bhutan. The country currently lacks anything like the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> found in other nations where the game is more developed, with competitions being held in the car park of Changlimithang. The national team first took part in competitive futsal in the 2005 AFC Futsal Championship preliminary round, but suffered heavy losses. Prior to entering this competition, Bhutan was one of only 11 members of the AFC not to have introduced the sport. The eleven-a-side team spent a month at the Sports Complex Basketball Court in Thimphu practicing the game, with two Thai coaches, Mr. Somjit and Mr. Song Pong acting as national coaches in preparation for the tournament. Following this, as the promotion of futsal by national associations was mandated by the AFC, the Bhutan Football Federation expressed a desire to introduce the game into schools using pre-existing basketball and volleyball courts.|$|E
50|$|The Bhutan {{national}} futsal team represents Bhutan in men's international futsal. The team {{is controlled}} by the governing body for football in Bhutan, the Bhutan Football Federation, which is currently a member of the Asian Football Federation and the regional body the South Asian Football Federation.

The country currently lacks anything like the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> found in other nations where the game is more developed, with competitions being held in the car park of Changlimithang. A national team was selected at very short notice for the fourth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games held in Incheon, Korea in 2013. In their first game, they were soundly beaten 29-1 by Thailand, despite scoring through Dawa Dhendup in the first minute. The team is currently ranked 150th and last in the world futsal rankings, although this is a provisional ranking as the team have not played the minimum ten matches required for a formal ranking.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a single}} year without a Midland League, a re-formed {{competition}} entitled the Midland Counties League was formed, although common practice was still to {{refer to it as}} the [...] "Midland League" [...] and it is usually treated as a continuation of the former competition in reference sources. A few of the previous member clubs re-joined, with a number of new members, principally from the Central Alliance. With the formation of the Northern Premier League in 1968, the Midland League lost four of its most successful clubs, but by now the competition was a strong league again and more clubs were looking to join than the league had vacancies. To cater for this, the league formed a second division in 1975-76. This division became [...] "Division One" [...] while the previous clubs formed the [...] "Premier Division". Clubs had to achieve a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> to join the Premier Division, and in the seven seasons in which the two division format was used, no clubs were actually able to move from the lower to the upper tier.|$|E

Moreover, materials mostly used in construction were asbestos ceiling board, emulsion paint, floor screed among others. The study concluded that residential buildings in the study area were built with the basic facilities and materials for construction. The study therefore recommends the need for both the government and private players in housing to formulate policy to enforce a minimum standard of facilities and materials specification in residential buildings as essential need of man. This will eliminate the possibility of environmental challenges such as water and household-waste pollutions which could arise from non-availability of basic facilities and thereby improve the living conditions of the users...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an agent-based model developed {{to simulate the}} impact that different planning policies may have in enhancing the attractiveness of the industrial estates located in a network of four municipalities located in the North of Portugal. The policies were simulated using three scenarios that can be distinguished by the municipal level of coordination they are implemented and {{by the type of}} action performed. In the model, enterprises are agents looking for a suitable location and the estates attractiveness is based on their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities,</b> amenities, accessibility and in the cost of soil. The coordinated qualification of the industrial estates is the most effective policy to strengthen their attractiveness. It was in this scenario that more industrial estates become attractive and more enterprises relocated. Results also indicate that the promotion of diffused and unqualified industrial estates is an inefficient policy to attract enterprises.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to know the effect of family socio-economic characteristics towards parenting pattern of studying habits among elementary and secondary high schools. The respondents were parents from elementary and secondary high school. This was a cross sectional study which was performed among 400 parents at District of Indramayu, West Java Province in February-March 2009 who was selected purposively by the school principals. This research used the secondary data from the research investigated by Puspitawati et al.  (2009) with title of “Parent Satisfaction Survey of Basic Education Services Provided by Decentralized School System“ that was funded by PRMAP-ADB and Bappenas collaborated with LPPM-IPB. The results showed that most of respondents facilitated their children’s education at home with quite good <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> at home. It was shown that parents implemented parenting pattern of studying habits among their children with moderate level of parenting pattern. Based on SEM analysis, it was found that parenting pattern of studying habits performed by parents was influenced directly positive by family social characteristics among elementary students; it was influenced directly and indirectly negative by family social characteristics among secondary high school students; and it was influenced directly positive by family economic characteristics and education facilities at home among all students. </p...|$|E

30|$|To achieve {{flexibility}} {{and deal with}} disruption risks, the plants can perform outsourcing and use different transportation modes to deliver new products to customers. It is worthy to note {{that because of the}} keeping independency, the maximum amount of outsourced products should be restricted so that the supply chain network will be able to respond to customer needs effectively when some of the suppliers are disrupted. Disruption of suppliers could occur because of natural disaster or other issues such as terrorist attacks and labors strike. As mentioned in previous sections, alliance between facilities is a key factor to improve agility of the supply chain. Creating alliance between opened facilities, selected to form the agile supply chain network, enables facilities to share their information, improve organizational educations, leverage organizational skills, and participate in new product development. Therefore, we assume that the supply chain network pays a certain cost to create alliance between opened facilities in different echelons. As regards delivery time to customers playing an incredible role in improving responsiveness to customers, we assume that all costumer demands should be met in their expected times. Another important issue in SCND is determining the capacity of facilities which should be opened. Most of the previously presented models consider fixed capacities for facilities, whereas determining the capacity of facilities is often difficult in practice ([Wang et al. 2009]). Therefore, it is assumed that the capacity <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> is determined as a decision variable to avoid additional and useless costs.|$|E
