40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the pricing {{differences}} between a mutual co-operative underwriting system and a fixed-premium underwriting system in providing coverage for marine liability. There has been much debate in recent years within the marine <b>liability</b> <b>underwriting</b> industry over which method fosters more competition, and hence, lower premiums for shipowners who are required to carry such coverage in order to operate. This paper {{will look at the}} current mutual marine insurance industry (Protection & Indemnity Associations or P&I Clubs) to compare its pricing {{both before and after the}} entry into the market of the fixed-premium underwriters, using data from 1985 - 2000 that encompasses both a major loss cycle and normal cyclical pricing variations. This analysis will hopefully provide information on whether mutual premium levels for the P&I Clubs differed substantially with the entry of the fixed-price competitors. This is important for the individual shipowners belonging to these mutual underwriting associations, because any variation in premium pricing could mean the potential for either great savings or tremendou...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{versions of}} an expert system for marine <b>liability</b> insurance <b>underwriting.</b> The first version, built on a PC, {{was the result of}} a series of knowledge engineering sessions with an underwriter of an insurance company. The prototype was accurate, but it asked too many marginally relevant questions, without regard to the time and business constraints of the user. The second version was developed to address this concern. It initially asked only a subset of the relevant questions to arrive at a premium. If the premium was too high, the prototype attempted to reduce it by performing a sensitivity analysis on the results of the first round. This analysis was driven by meta-rules. The third version was built on a lisp machine using a graphical expert system-building tool. The graphical approach and greater flexibility of the tool provided the user with an overview of the domain and permitted him to have more control over the data. Any implementation {{of an expert}} system for marine <b>liability</b> insurance <b>underwriting</b> should incorporate the lessons learned from each of the three versions of the prototype. In addition, sensitivity analysis and a graphical interface could be useful for expert system domains other than insurance underwriting...|$|R
40|$|Liability risks may embody {{far-reaching}} financial {{consequences for}} individuals, business enterprises and professional people. This paper {{focuses on the}} underwriting process which {{should be taken into}} consideration by short-term insurers when they are underwriting the main types of liability insurance, which include employer’s, householder’s, personal, product, professional and public liability insurance. The improvement of financial decision-making by short-term insurers when <b>underwriting</b> <b>liability</b> insurance represents the objective of this research. A study of secondary data was done to identify the existing literature, which formed the basis for compiling a questionnaire to obtain primary data. The top 10 short-term insurers which are the market leaders of liability insurance in South Africa and who received more than 85 % of the annual gross written premiums for liability insurance in South Africa, represented the sample of the empirical study. This paper highlights the importance of the <b>underwriting</b> factors concerning <b>liability</b> insurance, how often the stipulations of insurance policies should be adjusted by the short-term insurers to account for the underwriting factors, as well as the problem areas which the underwriters may experience when they are <b>underwriting</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Possible solutions to solve the problem areas were also addresse...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To {{examine whether}} the {{properties}} of the combined-ratio series, an indicator of underwriting profitability in property-liability insurance, have changed over time. Design/methodology/approach – Using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), we check whether combined ratios are stationary. Findings – Underwriting profit has worsened in recent years, and combined ratios are non-stationary. This characteristic of combined ratios needs further analysis for its impact on underwriting cycles. Practical implications – Traditional concepts of underwriting cycles, such as predictable cycle lengths and trends, may have changed. Originality/value – The possibility of a non-stationary combined-ratio series is recognized, and the possible existence of non-stationarity and breaks in combined ratios is introduced.

2500|$|Arising {{simultaneously}} with these developments were wider issues: first, in the United States, an ever-widening interpretation {{by the courts}} of insurance coverage in relation to workers' compensation for asbestosis-related losses, which created a huge hole in Lloyd's claims reserves, which was initially not recognised and then not acknowledged. Second, {{by the end of}} the decade, almost all of the market agreements, such as the Joint Hull Agreement, which were effectively cartels mandating minimum terms, had been abandoned under pressure of competition. Third, new specialised policies had arisen which had the effect of concentrating risk: these included [...] "run-off" [...] policies, under which the <b>liability</b> of previous <b>underwriting</b> years would be transferred to the current year, and [...] "time and distance" [...] policies, whereby reserves would be used to buy a guarantee of future income.|$|R
40|$|Lost in {{the recent}} efforts to take {{political}} advantage of (or explain away) the rapid rise in liability insurance premiums is any real attempt to understand the underwriting cycle, {{why it is so}} severe in medical malpractice insurance, and what it might mean for the ability of malpractice liability to deliver on its risk distribution, loss prevention, and corrective justice objectives. This essay attempts to fill that gap. Part 1 provides a primer on the <b>liability</b> insurance <b>underwriting</b> cycle that draws on the research prompted by the mid- 1980 s insurance hard market. This part explains that the recent dramatic increases in predicted medical malpractice losses are a result of the insurance cycle, not dramatic changes in medical malpractice claim payments. Part 2 explores why the underwriting cycle is so severe in medical malpractice insurance. This part applies my recent Geneva Lecture analysis of liability risks to the specific problem of medical malpractice, with a fuller consideration of the dynamics of the underwriting cycle. In short, the cycle is so severe because there is a relatively long period between the time that the premiums for a medical malpractice policy are paid and the time that losses under that policy can be known with certainty, and because there is more uncertainty regarding future medical malpractice losses than many other kinds of losses. Part 3 explores whether insurance regulators should consider acting to moderate the underwriting cycle (assuming that they could do so). This part argues that there are good reasons to believe that medical malpractice insurance crises lead medical providers to improve patient safety and, therefore, that efforts to moderate the cycle could {{have a negative impact on}} patient safety. Further research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions, but leaving the insurance cycle alone would be the wiser course for now...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To {{examine the}} {{existence}} of underwriting cycles for the property-liability insurance industry as a whole, and by line of business. Specifically to consider whether the combined ratio is stationary and stable. Design/methodology/approach – The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is employed for unit roots, while dummy variable methods, the Chow test, and switching regression are used for stability. Findings – Underwriting profits of most lines of business and all lines combined are not stationary and have structural changes. For the whole property-liability industry, a structural change occurred in 1981. Before the change, underwriting cycles existed since combined ratios followed an AR(2) process. After the change, combined ratios are non-stationary. Practical implications – Without clear underwriting cycles, there is more difficulty for the insurance industry in pricing and reserving, for regulators in monitoring the financial strength of insurers, and for customers {{in terms of the}} affordability and availability of insurance. Originality/value – The paper recognizes the non-stationarity of combined-ratio series, years of structural changes in the insurance industry and specific lines of business, and the possibility that underwriting profit is cointegrated with investment income.

40|$|The {{drawdown}} of {{an asset}} {{is a risk}} measure {{defined in terms of}} the running maximum of the asset’s spot price over some period [0, T]. The asset price is said to have drawn down by at least $K over this period if there exists a time at which the underlying is at least $K below its maximum-to-date. We introduce insurance against a large realization of maximum drawdown and a novel way to hedge the <b>liability</b> incurred by <b>underwriting</b> this insurance. Our proposed insurance pays a fixed amount should the maximum drawdown exceed some fixed threshold over a specified period. The need for this drawdown insurance would diminish should markets rise before they fall. Consequently, we propose a second kind of cheaper maximum drawdown insurance that pays a fixed amount contingent on the drawdown preceding a drawup. We propose double barrier options as hedges for both kinds of insurance against large maximum drawdowns. In fact for the second kind of insurance we show that the hedge is model-free. Since double barrier options do not trade liquidly in all markets, we examine the assumptions under which alternative hedges using either single barrier options or standard vanilla options can be used...|$|R
40|$|Malpractice {{insurance}} {{of medical}} staff {{is probably the}} oldest professional <b>liability</b> insurance <b>underwritten</b> in the insurance market in Romania. The aim of our research is to theoretically examine in a qualitative inquiry the usefulness of insurance completion by the practitioners from the Romanian health system at both state and private, {{in order to improve}} a best practice medical insurance. The medical profession is practiced in Romania under the Code of Medical Ethics 30 March 2012 prepared in code that complies with international standards contained in the Geneva Declaration of 1948, as amended by the World Medical Association and the International Code of Medical Ethics. The forms of medical liability are: disciplinary, administrative, civil and criminal and only the civil liability can be taken into insurance because only it meets the conditions of insurability. Once we explain in general and the insurance liability in particular we show articles of the Romanian Civil Code which establishes the obligation the one that caused an injury to a third person for the repair or indemnify and conditions provided by the Civil Code as an act to be considered liability. Then we refer to situations where the patient may be damaged through the fault of the doctor or the doctor unit operates. The object of malpractice insurance is loss of money that the insured would have to pay a patient whom he caused injury as a result of acts or deeds of negligence committed to, during and in relation to professional activity. Risks taken in the insurance are personal injury, illness or death of the patient and / or moral damages. Regarding the excluded risks we have presented an overview of the more common contracts underwritten by Romanian insurance companies. We show the way of underwriting, the insured sums of the standard insurance and the additional one which subscribes moral damages, to companies in Romania agreed by bodies which organize and supervise the Romanian medical system. The current procedure for determining the guilt of a doctor and his patient complained of the amount of damages is a long and difficult. The procedure for determining the guilt of a doctor reported by his patient and the amount of compensation is a long and arduous one. In conclusions we have shown that along with the reform and reorganization of the Romanian medical system, the civil liability insurance of the medical staff, the way of contracting, the way of establishing the guilt of the applicant and the amount of compensation need to be reformed...|$|R
