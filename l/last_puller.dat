5000|$|Pull begins {{promptly}} at 3 pm. Each {{team has}} 20 Pullers who each {{have their own}} Moralers. Moralers were once called [...] "Morale Girls" [...] but this was changed to allow more gender neutrality. While {{there have been several}} female Pullers, {{there has never been a}} male Moraler. As Pull is so physically and mentally straining, Moralers are important supporters in those respects. However, their key purpose is to act as the Pullers' eyes as they cannot see the Coach throwing the calls from their pits, and all 18 pits must move together for success. Even Year and Odd Year each have their own secretive methods for deciding the order in which Pullers may choose their Moralers. At the beginning of the event, the rope is marked at the front of Pit 1, so that a winner may be determined should it remain very close and that a margin of victory can be measured. While there are 20 pairs of Pullers and Moralers, there are only 18 pits. Each team has what are called [...] "sprinters" [...] and [...] "marathoners". Each year has a strategy as to which pits they reserve for these special members of the teams. As the first half hour of Pull is both very crucial and very tiring, the sprinters are in these pits for that time. At the half hour mark, both of these pits are switched and the marathoners go in for the remainder of the Pull. There are doctors and judges on each side, and if it is deemed that someone must come off the rope, a sprinter or marathoner may take his or her place. Each side also has two more special pits, at the back of the team. The very <b>last</b> <b>Puller</b> is the [...] "Anchor" [...] and is typically the heaviest member of the team. The Anchor and his Moraler are the only members of the team who are standing for the entirety of Pull. In front of the anchor is [...] "Pit 17" [...] who will occasionally take on the Anchor's duties while the Anchor and his Moraler adjust the rope, and as such Pit 17 and his or her Moraler must be specially trained.|$|E

60|$|The pause which succeeds this {{outburst}} is {{the effect}} of a spasm of admiration at a pair of high boots, which, by great exertion, he has at <b>last</b> <b>pulled</b> on his feet.|$|R
50|$|Millennium Ramping - Ramping begins {{after six}} trigger pulls {{at a minimum}} rate of 7.5 pulls per second; the player must {{maintain}} 7.5 trigger pulls per second to maintain ramping. Rate of fire cannot exceed 10.5 balls per second. When the player ceases {{to pull the trigger}} during ramping, no more than one extra ball may be fired after the <b>last</b> <b>pull.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Breaking all law, custom, precedent, {{and trail}} usage," [...] Smoke replied. [...] "I'm going {{to feed the}} dogs {{in the middle of}} the day--just this once. They've worked hard, and that <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> to the top of the divide is before them. Besides, Bright there has been talking to me, telling me all untellable things with those eyes of his." ...|$|R
60|$|Her words fell on deaf ears. Mr. Chalk, gazing {{through the}} window, heard without comprehending a long {{account of the}} capture of a new housemaid, which, {{slightly}} altered as to name and place, would have passed muster as an exciting contest between a skilful angler and a particularly sulky salmon. Mrs. Chalk, noticing his inattention at <b>last,</b> <b>pulled</b> up sharply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven and earth!" [...] said Augustus at <b>last,</b> <b>pulling</b> out his watch. [...] "It only wants {{three minutes}} to seven. I shall have a dozen {{messages}} from the judge before I get down, to know whether he shall come and help me change my boots. I'll see you again before I go to bed. Good-bye, old fellow." [...] And then Graham was again alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have given}} the signal at last!" [...] cried the Pharisee-----"they {{have given the}} signal at <b>last!</b> <b>pull</b> away, Abel-Phittim!--and thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!--for verily the Philistines have either still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath {{softened}} their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight!" [...] And the Gizbarim pulled away, while their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of "The <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> on {{the diamond}} hitch" [...] two men packing a burro, ca. 1898. One man, using his leftt foot and leg for {{leverage}} against the burro, tugs {{on a rope}} holding the pack to the burro. The other man adjusts the rope on the pack. They both wear jackets over their shirts, with trousers, and hats. The desert landscape rocky and arid. A rocky slope is visible in the background...|$|R
60|$|We {{followed}} him thus for {{a mile or}} two, along the regular path; then of a sudden, in an open part, the trail failed us. I turned back, a few yards, and looked close, with my {{eyes fixed on the}} spongy soil, as keen as a hound that sniffs his way after his quarry. 'He went off here, Elsie!' I said at <b>last,</b> <b>pulling</b> up short by a spindle bush on the hillside.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached the}} lanthorn at <b>last,</b> and <b>pulling</b> aside the cloak, {{he lifted the}} light and set it upon the table.|$|R
50|$|In February 1946 William Cantrell Ashley was at sea {{for more}} than 24 hours in severe weather {{standing}} by the broken down submarine HMS Universal and helping to rescue her crew. William Cantrell Ashley was the RNLI's <b>last</b> <b>pulling</b> and sailing lifeboat when she was retired in 1948 after 41 years' service. She was {{passed on to the}} first Outward Bound school at Aberdovey. In the same year the RNLI adapted the station for a new lifeboat and built a tractor house.|$|R
6000|$|They sat long {{over their}} dinner. At <b>last</b> Pinney <b>pulled</b> out his watch. [...] "What time {{did you say}} the boat for Quebec got along here?" ...|$|R
60|$|But the cab {{slowed down}} at <b>last</b> and <b>pulled</b> up. In an instant Douglas Stone was out, and the Smyrna merchant's toe {{was at his}} very heel.|$|R
60|$|They met the firemen, come at <b>last,</b> and <b>pulling</b> {{in their}} hose, {{who began to}} play upon the flames; the steam filled the place with a dense mist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{thought it}} was you. Always tell a {{military}} man, you know. Excuse me, but I am resting for a minute, this <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> is an uncommonly stiff one. I always used to tell my dear old friend, Mrs. Massey, that she {{ought to have the}} hill cut away a bit just here. Well, here goes for it," [...] and after a few heavy steps his visitor emerged from the shadow of the trees into the sunset light which was playing on the terrace before the house.|$|R
60|$|They drove {{along the}} Embankment, citywards. The {{heat of the}} city seemed {{to rise from the}} pavements. The wall of the Embankment was lined with people, leaning over to catch the languid breeze that crept up with the tide. They crossed the river and {{threaded}} their way through a nightmare of squalid streets, where half-dressed men and women hung from the top windows and were even to be seen upon the roof, struggling for air. The car at <b>last</b> <b>pulled</b> up at the corner of a long street.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{may lead}} better lives, and bring forward abler arguments; but [...] their efforts are paralysed by that unsoundness. I see the High [...] Churchman professing {{to believe in}} the {{existence}} of a church, when the [...] most palpable facts must show him that no such church exists; the [...] "Low" [...] Churchman professing to believe in exceptional interpositions [...] which his philosophy secretly questions; the [...] "Broad" [...] Churchman [...] professing as absolute an attachment to the Established Church as the [...] narrowest could feel, while he is preaching such principles as will at [...] <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> it down.|$|R
60|$|Mulford made no {{immediate}} answer, but remained at Rose's side, watching {{the movements of}} the captain. The <b>last</b> <b>pulled</b> directly to the islet with the buildings, a distance of only a few hundred feet, the light-house being constructed on a rocky island that was nearly in the centre of the cluster, most probably to protect it from the ravages of the waves. The fact, however, proved, as Mulford did not fail to suggest to his companion, that the beacon had been erected less to guide vessels into the haven, than to warn mariners at a distance, of the position of the whole group.|$|R
6000|$|... "A dark night, smooth water, {{and fresh}} hands make boating {{agreeable}} duty!" [...] he said. [...] "The gentlemen are in fine heart, {{and full of}} young men's hopes; but he who lays that brigantine aboard, will, in my poor judgment, have {{more work to do}} than merely getting up her side. I was in the foremost boat that boarded a Spaniard in the Mona, last war; and though we went into her with light heels, some of us were brought out with broken heads.--I think the fore-top-gallant-mast has a better set, Captain Ludlow, since we gave the <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> at the rigging?" ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>last</b> Jimmy <b>pulled</b> Toby {{out of the}} crowd, {{and after}} calling to a young Typee who was {{standing}} by with a young pig in his arms, all three started for the mountains.|$|R
6000|$|Apparently {{the driver}} was {{accustomed}} to such scenes, for after a glance through his little window he took no further notice. So it went on until at <b>last</b> he <b>pulled</b> up and shouted: ...|$|R

5000|$|Bowman grew up {{traveling}} around the world. He began his acting career on North Shore in 2004. He was later cast as Steve Jenkins, a character seen on the first season of Lost (2004-2005). Bowman joined the cast of Prison Break as Agent King (2007-2008), The Lying Game (2012) and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014).

6000|$|... 'So {{he brought}} a gallon of hot brandy and beer, ready mixed, to church {{with him in the}} afternoon, and by keeping the jar well wrapped up in Timothy Thomas's bass-viol bag it kept drinkably warm till they wanted it, which was just a thimbleful in the Absolution, and another after the Creed, and the {{remainder}} at the beginning o' the sermon. When they'd had the <b>last</b> <b>pull</b> they felt quite comfortable and warm, and as the sermon went on--most unfortunately for 'em it was a long one that afternoon--they fell asleep, every man jack of 'em; and there they slept on as sound as rocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! Why, I'm {{perfectly}} well. I {{never felt}} better in my life. Of course, that congestion <b>last</b> winter <b>pulled</b> me down a little. But just see my color. I don't {{look much like}} an invalid, I'm sure." ...|$|R
25|$|Historically, Whitehorse {{also was}} the {{location}} of units of the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force; the Canadian Army was the <b>last</b> to <b>pull</b> out in 1968, {{at the same time}} the armed forces were unified.|$|R

60|$|When we at <b>last</b> <b>pulled</b> up we had {{set some}} {{three or four}} miles between the gibbet and ourselves. Right over against us, {{on the side of}} a gentle slope, stood a bright little village, with a red-roofed church rising up from amidst a clump of trees. To our eyes, after the dull sward of the plain, it was a glad sight to see the green spread of the {{branches}} and the pleasant gardens which girt the hamlet round. All morning we had seen no sight of a human being, save the old hag upon the moor and a few peat-cutters in the distance. Our belts, too, were beginning to be loose upon us, and the remembrance of our breakfast more faint.|$|R
5000|$|This {{game had}} the {{contestant}} stand behind {{a pair of}} containers that he/she couldn't see the contents of. Each container had three colored balls: red, yellow, and green. The contestant would draw one ball from the container on their right to establish a [...] "base" [...] color. The player was then spotted $5,000 and asked to draw a ball from the other container. Pulling out a different color would earn the contestant another $5,000, while failing added nothing. After three pulls, the contestant was offered the choice to stop or try for one <b>last</b> <b>pull.</b> A second ball of the base color would then {{be added to the}} mix. A mismatch would triple the money, while a match cost the contestant half of their earnings. Maximum payoff is $60,000.|$|R
60|$|Almayer saw {{the boat}} go off at <b>last,</b> <b>pulled</b> anyhow by men that were cold, hungry, and sulky; and he {{remained}} on the jetty watching it down the reach. It was broad day then, {{and the sky was}} perfectly cloudless. Almayer went up to the house for a moment. His household was all astir and wondering at the strange disappearance of the Sirani woman, who had taken her child and had left her luggage. Almayer spoke to no one, got his revolver, and went down to the river again. He jumped into a small canoe and paddled himself towards the schooner. He worked very leisurely, but {{as soon as he was}} nearly alongside he began to hail the silent craft with the tone and appearance of a man in a tremendous hurry.|$|R
