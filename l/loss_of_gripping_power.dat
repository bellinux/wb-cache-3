This study examines the relationship between cortisol, muscle mass and muscle strength in community-dwelling older persons {{and the role of}} genetic variations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Design/patients: The study was conducted within the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam (LASA, 1992 -ongoing), a cohort study in a population-based sample of older persons in the Netherlands. Data were used from 1196 and 1046 participants in the second (1995 - 1996) and fourth (2001 - 2002) cycle, respectively. Measurements: Total serum cortisol and free cortisol were measured in the mornings of the second cycle while salivary cortisol sampled {{early in the morning and}} late at night were measured in the fourth cycle. The GR gene polymorphisms (ER 22 / 23 EK, N 363 SS, 9 β and BclI) were genotyped by Taqman. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) was measured using DXA in the second cycle and 3 years later (third cycle). Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer in the second, third, fourth and fifth cycle. Results: A relationship was found between both morning and evening salivary cortisol, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength: participants in the highest quartile of cortisol concentration had a twofold higher risk <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength than participants in the lowest quartile (P < 0. 05). No relationships were found between serum cortisol (<b>loss</b> <b>of)</b> ASMM, and (<b>loss</b> <b>of)</b> <b>grip</b> strength. The ER 22 / 23 EK and N 363 S-polymorphisms modified the relationships between serum cortisol, ASMM and grip strength, respectively. Due to limited power, these relationships were not significant after stratification for the polymorphisms. Conclusion: High salivary cortisol is associated with a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength in older persons. GR genotypes modify the relationship between muscle mass and muscle strength. © 2008 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Subluxation of ulna in distal radioulnar joint {{disorders}} causes pain on motion, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength, and a {{restriction of}} forearm rotation. Several procedures {{have been described}} to salvage DRUJ disorders including the Darrach procedure, the matched distal ulnar resection, the hemiresection interposition arthroplasty (Bowers procedure) and the Sauve-Kapandji (S-K) procedure. All these procedures are associated with either <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip,</b> pain over proximal ulnar stump or instability. We describe our modification of S-K procedure with good functional outcome. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients, 12 male and 8 female, underwent S-K procedure, with our modification, were included in this study. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and on followup visits using Modified Mayo Wrist Score and wrist radiographs. Average followup period was 34. 55 months (range 24 - 64 months). Results: Excellent results were found in one patient, good in 15 patients, and fair in four patients.

40|$|BackgroundAromatase inhibitors (AIs) {{frequently}} {{lead to the}} AI-induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS). Looking {{into its}} pathophysiology, 6 months of AI therapy thickens the tendon sheath with intra-articular fluid (IAF) retention and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength. We here report 24 -month follow-up data. Patients and methodsA prospective cohort study of 33 postmenopausal breast cancer patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy; 27 received an AI and 6 received tamoxifen. At baseline, 6 and 24 months patients had a rheumatologic examination, including a grip strength test, and magnetic resonance imaging of both hands and wrists. The primary end point was tenosynovial changes; secondary end points were changes in morning stiffness, grip strength and IAF. ResultsTwenty-three AI and 5 tamoxifen patients completed all investigations. Between month 6 and 24, IAF further increased in AI users (P =  0. 04) but not in tamoxifen users, and grip strength further decreased in both groups. The worsened tenosynovial changes were strongly correlated with a decrease in grip strength. At 24 months, morning stiffness continued {{to be present in}} over a third of AI users. ConclusionAIMSS represents a substantial problem in breast cancer patients. It is associated with tenosynovial changes, IAF retention, joint stiffness and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>grip</b> strength that do not improve with prolonged use. status: publishe...|$|R

Cortical continuity was observed after 6  months, while the diameter of the screw was significantly reduced (Fig.  8 c). After 12  months of implantation, the distal radius fracture was completely healed, while the remaining screw was nearly impossible to differentiate from new surrounding bones. The patients did not feel any discomfort or pain throughout the entire study.
