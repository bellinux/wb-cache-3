5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become <b>less</b> <b>risky</b> and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E
5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was <b>less</b> <b>risky</b> than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E
5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of <b>less</b> <b>risky</b> and more critical needs.|$|E

5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment in August 1941 {{and it was}} {{initially}} committed to the ground attack and escort roles after retraining through September. It was redesignated as the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment on 25 September and assigned to the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps of the PVO defending Moscow. A few days later six Pe-3s escorted C-47s carrying a British military delegation flying from Vologda to Moscow and successfully defended against several German attacks on the transports. Pe-3s strafed German troop columns as they approached Moscow during Operation Typhoon. On 24 October the 95th and 208th Fighter Aviation Regiments, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven Pe-3s between them, attacked the German airfield at Kalinin, claiming thirty German aircraft destroyed for the loss of five Soviet aircraft and pilots, including the commander of the 208th Regiment, Major S. Kibirinym. The 9th, 40th, 54th and 511th Bomber Aviation Regiments also received Pe-3s during September and performed similar missions. Approximately 50 aircraft were lost during the Pe-3's first three months of combat, about 25% of the aircraft produced thus far. This was a very high loss rate and a number of units began to conduct <b>less</b> <b>risky</b> reconnaissance missions to minimize casualties. Pe-3s were issued to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiments in October as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{microcredit}} market, where inexperienced micro-borrowers meet experienced microfinance institutions (MFIs), {{is subject}} to reversed asymmetric information. Thus, MFIs' choices can shape borrowers' beliefs and their behavior. We analyze how this mechanism may influence microfinance institution decisions to allocate business training. By means of a theoretical model, we show that superior information can lead the MFI not to train (or to train <b>less)</b> <b>riskier</b> borrowers. We then investigate whether this mechanism is empirically relevant, using data from a French MFI. Confirming our theoretical reasoning, we find a non-monotonic relationship between the MFI's decision to train and the risk that micro-borrowers represent. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|To {{assist with}} {{increasing}} the recovery factor, {{two types of}} Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are being evaluated which could increase the recovery by up to 25%. The <b>less</b> <b>riskier</b> and costly {{of them would be}} to undertake a Polymer flood instead of a traditional water flood. This is strategy is not very dependent on the oil price, well location or extensive testing. The other option is to undertake Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer flooding (ASP). ASP flooding would be riskier in terms of costs, well spacing, development time (five years), and would be more sensitive to the oil price. However, the rewards for it are significantly higher, potentially increasing the incremental reserves by 25% when compared to polymer or water flooding.|$|R

40|$|We test {{predictability}} on {{asset price}} using stock selection rules based on maximum drawdown and consecutive recovery. Monthly momentum- and weekly contrarian-style portfolios ranked by the alternative selection criteria are implemented in various asset classes. Regardless of market, the alternative ranking rules are superior in forecasting asset prices and capturing cross-sectional return differentials. In a monthly period, alternative portfolios constructed by maximum drawdown measures dominate other momentum portfolios including the cumulative return-based momentum portfolios. Recovery-related stock selection criteria {{are the best}} ranking measures for predicting mean-reversion in a weekly scale. Prediction on future directions becomes more consistent, because the alternative portfolios are <b>less</b> <b>riskier</b> in various reward-risk measures such as Sharpe ratio, VaR, CVaR and maximum drawdown. In the Carhart four-factor analysis, higher factor-neutral intercepts for the alternative strategies are another evidence for the robust prediction by the alternative stock selection rules.

Estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) which incorporates losses beyond VaR are used as market risk measures for both univariate and multivariate portfolios. Our key input is the share price by market capitalization of publicly traded banks of similar size in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. Univariate analysis finds no discernible differences between Islamic and conventional banks. However, dynamic correlations obtained via a multivariate setting shows Islamic banks to be <b>less</b> <b>riskier</b> for both sets of conventional banks; and especially so during the recent global financial crisis. The policy implications are: (i) that the inclusion of Islamic banks within asset portfolios may mitigate potential risk; (ii) that the Basel committee should consider the ES measure of risk for Islamic banks in preference to the current VaR methodology, which over-estimates the market risk of Islamic banks...|$|R

25|$|Opioids {{are being}} used more {{frequently}} {{in the management of}} non-malignant chronic pain. This practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids.

Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives. They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone (Percocet) and ibuprofen combined with hydrocodone (Vicoprofen), which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use.|$|E
25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are <b>less</b> <b>risky</b> to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E
40|$|Uncertainties as {{to future}} supply costs of nonrenewable natural resources, {{such as oil}} and gas, {{raise the issue of}} the choice of supply sources. In a {{perfectly}} deterministic world, an efficient use of multiple sources of supply requires that any given market exhausts the supply it can draw from a low cost source before moving on to a higher cost one, supply sources should be exploited in strict sequence of increasing marginal cost, with a high cost source being left untouched as long as a less costly source is available. We find that {{this may not be the}} efficient thing to do in a stochastic world. We show that there exist conditions under which it can be efficient to use a risky supply source in order to conserve a cheaper non risky source. The benefit of doing this comes from the fact that it leaves open the possibility of using it instead of the risky source in the event the latter’s future cost conditions suddenly deteriorate. There are also conditions under which it will be efficient to use a more costly non risky source while a <b>less</b> costly <b>risky</b> source is still available. The reason is that this conserves the <b>less</b> costly <b>risky</b> source in order to use it in the event of a possible future drop in its cost.

40|$|This master thesis starts by {{introducing}} {{the concept of}} microfinance. It shows that MFI rating is an important tool in achieving transparency. The study attempts to determine the relationship between social and financial indicators and the MFI rating grade. These indicators are chosen based on previous studies on ratings and microfinance. The data comes from ratings reports performed by five major MFI rating agencies: MicroRate, Planet Rating, Microfinanza, Crisil and M-Cril. Data transformation was used to achieve normal distribution of the variables. The empirical research was carried out using multiple regression analysis. A few equations were tested to find the optimal model. The findings of the study revealed that MFI size, risk, profitability, productivity and efficiency are significant determinants of rating grades. Larger and <b>less</b> <b>riskier</b> MFI tend to get better rating grades. Increasing profitability, productivity and efficiency of the MFI will increase the rating grade. No significant relationship between the social performance of MFI and the rating grade assigned was found. Control variables were used {{to account for the}} possible affect of MFI region, motive (profit or not) and agency that performed the rating.
