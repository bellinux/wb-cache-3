5000|$|Building {{on prior}} {{work done by}} such {{companies}} as Intech Labs (aka American Modem & AMDAX), Sytek built an RF transceiver that operated on cable TV frequencies. It received in the High VHF band and transmitted in the Low VHF band. These bands were {{referred to as the}} forward and reverse channels. Within any given frequency band, it was possible to have many, many, virtual circuits between devices. In order to increase the advantage of using FDM on the cable, Sytek added an algorithm based on CSMA/CD. There were few, if any, IEEE standards at that time.All of the devices, called T-Boxes, were equipped with an EIA RS-232 serial interface, which had a 'legal' maximum data rate of 19.2 kbit/s. While this may seem slow by today's standards, it was considered very fast in 1982. Determining a need for PC-PC and (especially) PC-mainframe communications, IBM asked Sytek to manufacture <b>LAN</b> <b>adapter</b> cards based on their FDM/TDM technology for IBM PCs, which they did.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis described {{the design and}} implementation of a fiber optic link for a token ring local area network (LAN). It features the use of fiber optic channels as the transmission medium between a computer system and a wiring concentrator to convert a physical ring design into a star-wired configuration. The LAN was controlled by the TMS 380 <b>LAN</b> <b>Adapter</b> chipset, which provided all diagnostic and network management features to include the 4 Mb/s electrical signal for operation. Since this adapter was developed for systems using twisted wire pair adapter cables, design modifications required that the fiber link be able to simulate impedance and current characteristics of the copper wire link. This allows the use of adapter diagnostic checks for ring continuity and proper ring operation.

40|$|Network {{interconnection}} (internetworking) is {{an important}} issue in the area of computer communication. One of the purposes of internetworking is to allow communication to go beyond a single local area network (LAN). In this thesis, networks interconnection is studied. An internetworking device - (gate-way) is proposed to provide the capability of internetwork data transmission between LANs through an ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network). This gateway is an application layer program which interfaces with the NetBIOS (Network Input Output System), a widely implemented interface between application programs and LANs in the IBM personal computer world. The NetBIOS interface is provided in both LAN and ISDN environments in a connection-oriented mode. A facility for file transfer and information exchange among LANs through ISDN is developed {{in such a way that}} it neither affects the existing network hardware and software available in both LANs and ISDN nor changes the mechanism of communication within a LAN. In particular, the emphasis is given to the specification, design and implementation of the gateway. In our model, the gateway is specified with a finite state machine. Based on the model, the gateway is designed by considering the issues of naming, name assigning, buffering, session handling, multi-session managing and error processing. A prototype of the gateway is implemented on a PC/XT computer with a <b>LAN</b> <b>adapter,</b> an ISDN adapter and the gateway program coded in "C". Performance benchmarks are conducted in terms of two factors: Message size and background traffic. These factors may affect the performance of internetwork data transmission. Finally, test results on different network conditions are given...|$|E
