50|$|Macro {{photography}} {{may also}} be accomplished by mounting a <b>lens</b> in <b>reverse,</b> {{in front of a}} normally mounted lens of greater focal length, using a macro coupler which screws into the front filter threads of both lenses. This method allows most cameras to maintain the full function of electronic and mechanical communication with the normally mounted lens, for features such as open-aperture metering. The magnification ratio is calculated by dividing the focal length of the normally mounted lens by the focal length of the <b>reversed</b> <b>lens</b> (e.g., when an 18 mm <b>lens</b> is <b>reverse</b> mounted on a 300 mm lens the reproduction ratio is 16:1). The use of automatic focus is not advisable if the first lens is not of the internal-focusing type, as the extra weight of the reverse-mounted lens could damage the autofocus mechanism. Working distance is significantly less than the first lens.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there had}} been {{speculation}} in the trade press over a future Super Rolleiflex for some time, {{it was not until}} 1966 that the SL66 finally appeared, SL being an abbreviation for single lens. It was a sophisticated system camera, a camera at the heart of an extensive range of interchangeable components. The SL66 had built-in bellows, as well as a pivoting front (lens) standard that could be tilted back and forth by 8°, thus allowing the region of sharpness to be manipulated according to the Scheimpflug principle. In addition, the lens could be mounted in reverse, thereby enabling macrophotography without additional equipment. With the normal <b>lens</b> <b>reversed</b> and the bellows extended by 50 mm, close-up photography with a magnification ratio of 1.5× was possible.

40|$|The retina {{contains}} complex circuits {{of neurons}} that extract salient information from visual inputs. Signals from photoreceptors are processed by retinal interneurons, integrated by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) {{and sent to}} the brain by RGC axons. Distinct types of RGC respond to different visual features, such as increases or decreases in light intensity (ON and OFF cells, respectively), colour or moving objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Thus, RGCs comprise a set of parallel pathways from the eye to the brain. The identification of molecular markers for RGC subsets will facilitate attempts to correlate their structure with their function, assess their synaptic inputs and targets, and study their diversification. Here we show, by means of a transgenic marking method, that junctional adhesion molecule B (JAM-B) marks a previously unrecognized class of OFF RGCs in mice. These cells have asymmetric dendritic arbors aligned in a dorsal-to-ventral direction across the retina. Their receptive fields are also asymmetric and respond selectively to stimuli moving in a soma-to-dendrite direction; because the <b>lens</b> <b>reverses</b> the image of the world on the retina, these cells detect upward motion in the visual field. Thus, JAM-B identifies a unique population of RGCs in which structure corresponds remarkably to function...|$|R

The use of these third-party lenses is not supported by Canon. Sometimes compatibility problems arise, as no third party has access to Canon's specifications for camera to body communication. These compatibility issues mostly occur when using a newer body with an older third-party lens. Over time, most of these issues have been resolved by the major third-party brands.|$|R
5000|$|Ordinary lenses can be {{used for}} macro {{photography}} by using a [...] "reversing ring." [...] This ring attaches to the filter thread on the front of a lens and makes it possible to attach the <b>lens</b> in <b>reverse.</b> Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible. For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be assembled. Since non-macro lenses are optimized for small reproduction ratios, <b>reversing</b> the <b>lens</b> allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Presbyopia is {{a common}} age-related {{condition}} that prevents people from focusing on near objects. The etiology of presbyopia continues to be debated, but the end effect of all postulated mechanisms {{is the lack of}} deformation of the human lens. Using our understanding of the biomechanical properties of the natural human lens, we created a unique accommodating intraocular lens. Although this lens can be used for lenticular disease such as myopia and hyperoperopia, this study addresses the needs of cataract patients with presbyopia. Methods: The lens was implanted into presbyopic human cadaver eyes. Focal length of the lens was measured with simulated muscle contraction. Lens dimensions were measured using artificial tissue and a finite-element analysis (FEA) to simulate accommodation. Lens power was measured at various fill volumes. Accelerated soak testing for an equivalent of 7. 4 years was performed and lens weight and optical transmittance were measured. Results: Previously presbyopic human eyes were able to accommodate between 2. 0 and 7. 4 diopters after lens implantation. FEA and lens measurements demonstrated a change in curvature of the anterior and posterior portions of the lens during accommodation. After accelerated aging, lens weight remained unchanged and optical transmission was 96 %. Lens power increased with fill volume. Conclusion: A deformable liquid <b>lens</b> <b>reversed</b> presbyopia, can be individualized by optically adjusting for each patient, is stable for long periods of time, and is compatible with minimally invasive surgical techniques. Significance: A deformable liquid-filled lens can significantly improve accommodation over the presbyopic natural lens...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the relative frequencies of correct identifications of variations in the fit of conventional rigid gas permeable (RGP) <b>lenses</b> and <b>reverse</b> geometry <b>lenses</b> (RGL) from fluorescein pattern analysis by orthokeratology (ortho-k) practitioners and non-ortho-k practitioners and to determine whether fluorescein pattern analysis is sensitive for assessing ortho-k lens fittings. Methods: Slides of fluorescein patterns of different lens fittings were shown to the practitioners, who were asked to identify the ideal, flatter, flattest, steeper and steepest lens fittings. Results: Observed frequencies of correct identifications of most of the conventional RGP lens fittingss were not significantly different from the expected frequencies for both groups of practitioners. The observed frequencies of correct identifications of all of the RGL fittings were either not significantly different or were lower than the expected frequencies. Conclusion: The relative frequencies of correct identifications of fluorescein patterns of both conventional RGP lens and RGL fittings by experienced ortho-k practitioners were not different from those by non-experienced ortho-k practitioners. Practitioners from the two groups were not always able to diagnose conventional RGP lens and RGL fittings adequately from fluorescein pattern analysis alone.

Methods: A 32 -year-old man attended to our clinic complaining of very poor vision in his right eye after bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis (treatment or surgery) for myopia correction and some additional retreatments afterward. After a comprehensive ocular evaluation, contact lens fitting with a reverse geometry hybrid contact lens (SynergEyes PS, SynergEyes, Carlsbad, CA) was proposed as a solution for this case. Visual, refractive, and ocular aberrometric outcomes with the contact lens were evaluated. Results: Distance visual acuity improved from a prefitting uncorrected value of 20 / 200 to a postfitting corrected value of 20 / 16. Prefitting manifest refraction was + 6. 00 sphere and − 3. 00 cylinder at 70 °, with a corrected distance visual acuity of 20 / 40. Higher order root mean square for a 5 -mm pupil changed from a prefitting value of 1. 45 to 0. 34 µm with the contact lens. The contact lens wearing was reported as comfortable, and the patient was very satisfied with this solution. Conclusions: The SynergEyes PS contact lens seems to be an excellent option for the visual rehabilitation of corneas with extreme irregularity after myopic excimer laser surgery, minimizing the level of higher order aberrations and providing an excellent visual outcome...|$|R

40|$|The {{islands of}} Bermuda and Great Exuma {{are similar in}} that they are both {{composed}} of Quaternary marginal-marine, calcarenitic limestones. These limestones are predominantly eolianite. Topographic depressions between eolian ridges are locally lower than present sea level; consequently, the ground water is coupled to inland marshes and ponds. The islands differ climatically. Rainfall in Bermuda exceeds potential evapotranspiration by about 0. 1 m/yr, while in Great Exuma, potential evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall by some 0. 5 m/yr. As a result, the inland ponds of Great Exuma are brackish to hypersaline, and fresh-water lenses are localized beneath the topographic highs between the ponds and the shoreline. In contrast, the marshes of Bermuda are not strong discharge sites, and the surrounding fresh-water lenses are geologically rather than topographically controlled. Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg modeling indicates that if the climates of Bermuda and Great Exuma were reversed, the characteristics of their fresh-water <b>lenses</b> would be <b>reversed</b> as well.

At the end of training, adaptation to a novel visuo-motor situation (20 -degree right shift lenses) was tested. We found that (1) training with variable practice can increase adaptability to a novel visuo-motor situation, (2) increased adaptability is retained for at least 1 month and is transferable to further novel visuo-motor permutations and (3) variable practice improves performance of a simple motor task even in the undisturbed state.

40|$|When {{moving through}} space, both optic flow and {{locomotor}} (proprioceptive/efference copy, vestibular) {{information can be}} used to judge the extent of a traveled distance. To better understand how each of these cues is used to estimate the magnitude of self-motion, it is important to dissociate the relative contributions of each when both are available in natural, cue-rich environments. This study created a conflict between visual and locomotor distance cues by either magnifying (2. 0 ×) or minimizing (0. 5 ×) the information contained in the optic array using spectacle-mounted lenses. The experiment took place in a large, open, outdoor field with few landmarks in the distant periphery. Subjects viewed a static target in the distance (6, 8, 10, 12 m) and reproduced this distance by walking. Three optical manipulations (OMs: 2. 0 ×, 1. 0 ×, 0. 5 ×) occurred either: A) during the initially learned visual preview, B) during the walked response, or C) during both learning and responding (same OM in each phase). When wearing the 2. 0 × lenses during the visual preview subjects produced estimates that were shorter than those produced when wearing the 1. 0 × <b>lenses.</b> The <b>reverse</b> effect was observed for the 0. 5 × lenses (significantly longer). Although these under/overestimations of static visual distance are significant in the predicted direction, the magnitude of the effect is less than expected considering the specifications of the lenses. In contrast, when the OM occurred during the walked response there were no lens-related effects, thus suggesting a reliance on locomotor cues. When the OM occurred during both learning and responding, lens-related effects were again observed in the expected directions, although were not as strong as when the OM occurred during the visual preview alone. Overall, the results suggest that locomotor information can be used effectively to reproduce a learned visual distance and appears to be the dominant cue when walking with magnified/minimized optic flow...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the short-term changes in human axial length (AxL) {{in response to}} continuous and competing episodes of myopic and hyperopic defocus. Methods The right eye of 16 young adults was exposed to 60 min episodes of either continuous or competing myopic and hyperopic defocus (+ 3 D & - 3 D), with the left eye optimally corrected to maintain far accommodation. During competing defocus, the eye was exposed to either 30 min or 15 min of alternating cycles of myopic and hyperopic defocus, with the order of <b>lens</b> wear <b>reversed</b> in separate sessions to assess the effects of defocus order. During each 60 min trial, the subjects watched a movie at 6 m in low photopic conditions. The right eye’s AxL was measured at baseline and then at 15 min intervals using Lenstar optical biometry. A binocular beam splitter periscope system was used to maintain distance fixation (left eye) and defocus exposure (right eye) during measurements. Results AxL underwent a greater magnitude of change during continuous defocus than during competing defocus. The maximum AxL change observed during continuous hyperopic defocus was + 7 ± 2 µm of elongation (p = 0. 015) and during continuous myopic defocus was - 8 ± 2 µm of reduction in AxL (p = 0. 07). When the eye was exposed to 30 min cycles of competing myopic and hyperopic defocus of equal duration, the opposing blur sessions cancelled {{each other and the}} eye was at near baseline levels following the final defocus session (final change from baseline, both p > 0. 05). When the frequency of alternating cycles was 15 min, there was a slight AxL reduction after 60 min of myopic then hyperopic defocus, and hyperopic then myopic defocus, and were - 3 ± 2 µm and - 4 ± 2 µm, respectively (final change from baseline, both p > 0. 05) (Figure 1). Conclusions In the human eye, the AxL changes within minutes in response to short-term imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus. With competing defocus, at 30 min exposure frequencies, the effects of myopic and hyperopic blur largely cancel each other. At higher frequencies (15 min of alternating exposure), the effect on AxL of myopic defocus appears to be slightly more potent than hyperopic defocus...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of 2. 5 mm-long hooker using improved pre-chop phacoemulsification method with ozil technique {{and to discuss}} the clinic characteristics of this improved surgery method. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed 247 patients(320 eyes) with ozil phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery. The 247 patients were randomly divided into two groups. The two groups were given different chop method during the surgery: improved pre-chop and traditional stop and chop. The improved pre-chop group were canceled water separation steps, the ultra-long chopper were entered into the capsular bag under the rim of continuous circular capsulorhexis, by passed the intraocular <b>lens</b> equator then <b>reversed</b> the hooker upward against the posterior pole of lens and cracked the nuclear into half with the phacoemulsification hand pieces extruding the nuclear from above downward without using energy, then rotated the nuclear and repeated the chop step. The control group used the traditional stop and chop technique. Pre-surgery recording included the best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) and corneal endothelial cell counting. Average power(AP), real ultrasound phacoemulsification time(U/Time), accumulated energy complex parameter(AECP), BSS perfusion amount and complications were recorded. And the corneal edema and corneal endothelial cell counting were observed at one week post the surgery. RESULTS: Compared the sub-group of two groups with the same hardness of nuclear, the AP, U/Time, AECP and the BSS perfusion amount of the improved pre-phaco group were lower than the stop and chop group(P< 0. 05) with significant difference. Also the lose rate of corneal endothelial cell of the improved pre-phaco group was lower than the stop and chop group(P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Using the improved pre-phaco method in the ozil phacoemulsification cataract surgery could raise the energy utilization efficiency, decrease the BBS perfusion amount during the surgery and further lower the injury to the corneal endothelial cell brought by the phacoemulsification surgery...|$|R
40|$|Fourier ptychographic (FP) imaging is a {{recently}} developed technique to get high-resolution high-throughput imaging. FP iteratively stitches together many variably illuminated, low-resolution intensity {{images in the}} Fourier space to expand the frequency passband and recover a high-resolution sample image. There are several latest developments of the Fourier ptychographic imaging scheme. FP scheme {{can be used as}} adaptive imaging method. An image-quality metric is defined as a guide star for the optimization process, and system corrections are then performed to maximize such a guide star. The adaptive FP scheme performs system correction by modifying the complex transfer function in the recovery process, which can be used to recover the unknown pupil function, perform system correction and recover unknown system parameters. To shorten the acquisition time of the FP platform, sparsely sampled FP, which uses a sparse-sampled mask to filter the captured intensity images, is developed and it reduced the acquisition time by ~ 50 %. In addition, the application of sub-sampled Fourier ptychography solved the pixel aliasing problem. State-multiplexed FP, which allows the illumination of at most 4 LEDs at the same time, is able to shorten the acquisition time and the number of frames for 2 ~ 4 times. Similar reconstruction procedure is used to decompose R/G/B data and recovery a colorful high-resolution image, which {{can also be used to}} replace spectral filter, gratings or other optical components for spectral multiplexing and demultiplexing. Pattern-illuminated FP extends the original FP from coherent imaging to incoherent imaging. Instead of using coherent light with different incident angles, pattern-illuminated FP uses different structured pattern to illuminate sample, and then recover a high resolution image. Finally, based on the FP algorithm, a field-portable high-resolution microscope using a cellphone lens was design for low-cost imaging.

40|$|Duncan, MelindaIntegrins are heterodimeric transmembrane {{extracellular}} matrix receptors that regulate cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM communication and require an ?? and a ?? subunit. The ?? 1 -integrin subunit {{is expressed in}} both epithelial and fiber cells within the lens, an epithelial tissue important for vision, and also interacts with {{the largest number of}} ?? subunits. Full deletion of ?? 1 -integrin from the developing lens causes embryonic lethality at the blastocyst stage. Therefore a conditional knock-out was created, deleting ?? 1 -integrin from the lens at embryonic day 12. 5 (E 12. 5). This caused severe disorganization of the lens by E 16. 5, with the absence of the central epithelium, elongation of the epithelial cells at the transition zone, and highly vacuolated fiber cells. These lens epithelial cells exhibited loss of their normal markers and up-regulation of fiber cell and EMT markers. Analysis of candidate genes based on their known roles in integrin, TGF??, and MAPK pathways failed to explain the observed phenotype. Hence, I used an unbiased analysis of gene expression changes to identify the likely regulator of the ?? 1 -integrin null phenotype. To do so, I chose to use next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), a novel technique for whole genome expression profiling in the lens. Although many researchers in the past have used expression microarrays, it has several limitations that include a reliance on existing knowledge about genome sequence, high background, and limited dynamic range. RNA-Seq, on the other hand, has very low background signal, unambiguous mapping capability, and increased sensitivity. This increased sensitivity allows us to sequence past a large bias towards structural proteins in the lens. I chose to sequence lenses at E 15. 5, one day prior to the onset of the ?? 1 MLR 10 phenotype, in attempt to obtain gene changes that are proximal to the cause of the fibrotic phenotype observed. With the help of Abby Manthey, I was able to collect wild type C 57 Bl/ 6 lenses for RNA-Seq, and compare them to ?? 1 MLR 10 lens samples. Through this comparison, it was found that over 7, 700 genes are expressed in the wild type lens at E 15. 5. To be able to determine biologically relevant gene changes, we compared two wild type mouse strains: C 57 Bl/ 6, an inbred strain, to a mixed background wild type strain. This comparison allowed us to determine that the lens expresses over 7, 000 genes over 2 Reads Per Kilobase per Million (RPKM), a measurement of gene transcript level. We also found that only 2 %, or 32 genes, of over 2, 300 differentially expressed genes between the different strains were above a 2. 5 fold change. Therefore any fold change less than this was likely to be due to genetic background strain variability, and not the deletion of ?? 1 -integrin from the lens. Therefore, to determine biologically relevant gene changes in the ?? 1 MR 10 lens, I used the following filtering criteria: mean RPKM ??? 2 p-value ??? 0. 05, and fold change ??? 2. 5. Using these filtering criteria, I was able to determine that 90 genes are differentially expressed three days after the deletion of ?? 1 -integrin and one day prior to the onset of the phenotype. A large subset of these genes are known {{to play a role in}} fibrotic responses and include: Egr 1, Nab 2, ??SMA, Mmp 14, Anxa 2, Plat, Mt 1, Thbs 1, Stmn 1, and Rpl 29. Egr 1, a transcription factor that is directly regulated by integrin signaling, in turn directly regulates MT 1, Nab 2, and ??SMA in other tissues. Egr 1 also has potential to regulate a number of differentially expressed genes within the ?? 1 MLR 10 lens through EGR 1 binding sites (EBS) within their promoter regions. This led me to the conclusion that Egr 1 is likely able to regulate the partial fibrotic phenotype observed in the ?? 1 conditional knock out <b>lens.</b> Using quantitative <b>reverse</b> transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, I was able to validate the differential expression of Egr 1, Nab 2, ??SMA, Mmp 14, Anxa 2, Plat and Rpl 29 at E 15. 5 in the ?? 1 MLR 10 lens. Interestingly, Egr 1, Nab 2, ??SMA, Mmp 14, Anxa 2, Plat (all genes up-regulated in RNA-Seq) are not only found to be up-regulated at E 15. 5, but are also up-regulated just one day after the full absence of the ?? 1 -integrin protein from the lens. This up-regulation continues to rise through E 15. 5, and remains high through E 16. 5. Immunolocalization also showed that Egr 1 is increased at the protein level at E 15. 5 and E 16. 5. Altogether, this strongly supports Egr 1 ???s role in mediating the partial fibrotic response observed in the ?? 1 MLR 10 lens. With Egr 1 ???s implication in mediating fibrotic responses in the embryonic lens, it seemed likely that it may be able to play a role in lens diseases such as cataracts and posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Cataract, or the loss of lens transparency, is a major disease of the lens that leads to loss of vision, and is the most common cause of blindness worldwide. Cataracts are commonly treated by extracapsular lens extraction, which involves the surgical removal of the bulk of the lens cells by phacoemulsification, and insertion of a prosthetic lens (or intraocular lens, IOL) into the remaining capsular bag. The remaining lens epithelial cells left on the anterior capsule after surgery proliferate and migrate to accumulate between the capsule and the IOL, where they become fibrotic plaques and cause re-clouding of the lens. This clouding of the lens after cataract surgery is known as posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Studies of PCO models have shown that the fibrotic cells express ??SMA, CD 44 and other markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, EGR 1 is able to regulate both ??SMA and CD 44 in other tissues, and is known to be involved in cataracts induced by selenite in the rat lens. Therefore, I hypothesize that Egr 1 may be an early regulator in lens injury responses such as PCO. By using a mouse cataract surgery model, I was able to investigate the expression of Egr 1, Nab 2, ??SMA and CD 44 at multiple time points after surgery. Considering Egr 1 is an immediate early response gene, I analyzed samples at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-surgery. Preliminary results using qRT-PCR analysis with one biological replicate seemed promising, with a strong up-regulation of Egr 1 at 3 hours post-surgery. However, subsequent efforts to support this with three biological replicates were unsuccessful. My efforts to detect changes in Nab 2, ??SMA and CD 44 expression over this time frame were also unsuccessful using qRT-PCR. However, immunolocalization showed up regulation of EGR 1 protein just 3 hours after cataract surgery in the proliferating epithelial cells remaining in the lens capsule. Overall, Egr 1 is likely to play a major role in the embryonic fibrotic phenotype observed in the ?? 1 MLR 10 lens; up-regulating pro-fibrotic pathways through Nab 2, ??SMA, Mmp 14, Anxa 2 and Plat. It may also play an early role in PCO pathogenesis and other lens diseases. University of Delaware, Department of Biological SciencesM. S...|$|R
