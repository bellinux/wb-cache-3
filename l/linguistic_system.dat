5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>system,</b> meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>system,</b> meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>system,</b> but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

25|$|Semiotics {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within semiotics that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the <b>linguistic</b> <b>system,</b> the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E

500|$|Sounds {{as part of}} a <b>linguistic</b> <b>system</b> {{are called}} phonemes. Phonemes are {{abstract}} units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [...] and pat [...] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between [...] and [...] differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [...] and [...] (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like Korean and Hindi do: the unaspirated [...] in spin [...] and the aspirated [...] in pin [...] are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [...] 'crouch' and [...] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).|$|E

40|$|On Redundancy in Describing <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Systems</b> The {{notion of}} <b>system</b> of <b>linguistic</b> {{elements}} figures prominently in most post-Saussurian linguistics {{up to the}} present. A “system” is the network of the contrastive (or, distinctive) features each element in the system bears to the remaining elements. The meaning (valeur) of each element in the system is the set of features that are necessary and jointly sufficient to distinguish this element from all others. The paper addresses the problems of “redundancy”, i. e. the occurrence of features that are not strictly necessary in describing an element in a system. Redundancy is shown to smuggle into the description of <b>linguistic</b> <b>systems,</b> this infelicitous practice illustrated with some examples from the literature (e. g. the classical phonemic analysis of Russian by Cherry, Halle, and Jakobson, 1953). The logic and psychology of the occurrence of redundancy are briefly sketched and it is shown that, in addition to some other problems, redundancy leads to a huge and unresolvable ambiguity of descriptions of <b>linguistic</b> <b>systems</b> (the Buridan’s ass problem) ...|$|R

2500|$|The label {{systemic}} {{is related}} to the system networks used in the description of human languages. System networks capture the dimension of choice at each stratum of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>system</b> to which they are applied. The system networks of the lexicogrammar make up systemic functional grammar. A system network is a theoretical tool to describe the sets of options available in a language variety; it represents abstract choice and does not correspond to a notion of actual choice or make psychological claims. Formally system networks correspond to type lattices in formal lattice theory, although they are occasionally erroneously mistaken for flowcharts or directed decision trees. Such directionality is always only a property of particular implementations of the general notion and may be made for performance reasons in, for example, computational modelling. System networks commonly employ multiple inheritance and [...] "simultaneous" [...] systems, or choices, which therefore combine to generate very large descriptive spaces.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{prominent}} and respected literary theorist, Fish {{is best known}} for his analysis of interpretive communities [...] an offshoot of reader-response criticism. Fish's work in this field examines how the interpretation of a text is dependent upon each reader's own subjective experience in one or more communities, each of which is defined as a 'community' by a distinct epistemology. For Fish, a large part of what renders a reader’s subjective experience valuable — that is, why it may be considered “constrained” as opposed to an uncontrolled and idiosyncratic assertion of the self — comes from a concept native to the field of linguistics called linguistic competence. In Fish’s source the term is explained as “the idea that it is possible to characterize a <b>linguistic</b> <b>system</b> that every speaker shares.” In the context of literary criticism, Fish uses this concept to argue that a reader’s approach to a text is not completely subjective, and that an internalized understanding of language shared by the native speakers of that given language makes possible the creation of normative boundaries for one’s experience with language.|$|E
