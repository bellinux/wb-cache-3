5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling {{only for a}} cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had <b>little</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.|$|E

5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have <b>little</b> <b>effect.</b> Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E

5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} {{may occur}} during labour due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, {{but because the}} pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access to}} the mother's milk has <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the mortality rate of newborns.

5|$|In the 2002–03 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, but was given less {{responsibility}} {{with the ball}} and had little success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18. South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals. Up to this point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the overall}} course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most {{of the blame for}} the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Moldavians of Bessarabia {{were free}} peasants, of which most being landless, leasing their land from landlords and monasteries, while 12% (in 1861) were răzeşi ("yeomen").

5000|$|Storm Nine {{was first}} {{recognized}} southwest of Andros Island on September 26 near {{the north coast}} of Cuba. It passed through the northern Bahamas and headed on a north-northeasterly track across the western Atlantic.

5|$|The Disney bomb saw {{limited use}} by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945.

For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to <b>little</b> <b>effect,</b> their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
5|$|The Warrington and Stockport Railway was {{constructed}} through Dunham during 1853/54. Dunham Massey railway station served {{the area between}} 1854 and its closure in 1962. Dunham grew as a result, the population increasing by 57.5% between 1851 and 1881. Otherwise, the industrial revolution had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on Dunham Massey, and it remained a predominantly agricultural area.|$|E

The pure talc has <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> on humans, but inhalation of talc contaminated with asbestos can causes severe asbestos-related diseases such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma.

50|$|Although {{the strikes}} had <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> on Verizon, the strike {{did have a}} {{negative}} effect on competitors. The Verizon strike hurt competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) that relied on Verizon to help with the connection of their new customers to the network. CLECs are valuable in the market for every new customer they bring in, so without help from union workers on strike, CLECs suffered.|$|R
50|$|Storm Four was a {{very weak}} system that formed on August 20 about 200 mi east of Martinique and moved west-northwestward. Winds never rose above 40 mi/h km/h and after passing {{directly}} over Dominica and into the eastern Caribbean, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated well south of Hispaniola three days after forming. Very <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> were caused by this system.|$|R

5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs and had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> economically. Politically, however, {{it led to}} widespread condemnation in Belgium and internationally, helping {{the rise of the}} resistance. In late 1917, under pressure from neutral powers, most of the Belgian deported workers were returned.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} capture the ridge had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so {{overwhelming}} that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from the ridge {{in their attempt to}} keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E

5|$|The {{pamphlet}} {{was read}} by Augustin Robespierre, brother of Maximilien Robespierre, who {{was impressed by}} the revolutionary context. The pamphlet itself had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> against the rebellious forces, but served to advance Napoleon's career. He soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a Corsica-born politician, and family friend, Christophe Saliceti, who arranged to have it published and distributed. Christophe's influence, along with fellow Convention deputy Augustin Robespierre, advanced Napoleon into the position of senior gunner, at Toulon.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E

The effects of filler dispersion on the mechanical {{properties of the}} epoxy/alumina nanocomposites were studied. The fracture mechanisms are investigated using SEM.
