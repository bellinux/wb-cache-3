5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in <b>levothyroxine</b> dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of <b>levothyroxine.</b> There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal <b>levothyroxine</b> dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of <b>levothyroxine.</b> The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} 22 proteinogenic amino acids, many non-proteinogenic amino acids are known. Those either are {{not found in}} {{proteins}} (for example carnitine, GABA, <b>Levothyroxine)</b> or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, hydroxyproline and selenomethionine).|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. <b>Levothyroxine</b> should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The <b>levothyroxine</b> dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|Infants with {{thyroid hormone}} {{deficiency}} (congenital hypothyroidism) can manifest problems of physical {{growth and development}} as well as brain development, termed cretinism. Children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with <b>levothyroxine,</b> which facilitates normal growth and development.|$|E
5|$|Prevention at the {{population}} level {{has been with}} the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with <b>levothyroxine.</b> The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to <b>levothyroxine</b> {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as <b>levothyroxine</b> (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, <b>levothyroxine</b> or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, <b>levothyroxine</b> for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary <b>levothyroxine</b> may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's thyroiditis, {{regardless}} of whether or not hypothyroidism is present, can be treated with <b>levothyroxine.</b> If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goiter. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goiter.|$|E
2500|$|Hypothyroidism {{caused by}} Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is treated with thyroid hormone replacement agents such as <b>levothyroxine,</b> triiodothyronine or desiccated thyroid extract. A tablet taken {{once a day}} generally keeps the thyroid hormone levels normal. In most cases, the treatment {{needs to be taken}} {{for the rest of the}} person's life. In the event that hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it is recommended that the TSH levels be kept under 3.0 [...]|$|E
2500|$|Such drug {{interactions}} {{are associated with}} the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline. [...] As such, these {{drug interactions}} involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect. [...] The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of <b>levothyroxine.</b> The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose. [...] This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.|$|E
2500|$|Advantages are {{immediate}} cure {{and potential}} removal of carcinoma. Its risks are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hypoparathyroidism (due to {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands), hematoma (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), pregnancy, young age, relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and scarring. The increase {{in the risk of}} nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after complete thyroidectomy. Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid). [...] No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. [...] Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure [...] all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (i.e., near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be <b>levothyroxine,</b> or thyroid replacement pills to be taken {{for the rest of the}} patient's life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> for {{systemic}} administration is available as an oral tablet, an intramuscular injection, {{and as a}} solution for intravenous infusion. Furthermore, <b>levothyroxine</b> is available as both brand-name and generic products. While the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of generic <b>levothyroxine</b> for brand-name <b>levothyroxine</b> in 2004, the decision was met with disagreement by several medical associations. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, and the American Thyroid Association {{did not agree with}} the FDA that brand-name and generic formulations of <b>levothyroxine</b> were bioequivalent. As such, it was recommended that people be started and kept on either brand-name or generic <b>levothyroxine</b> formulations and not changed back and forth from one to the other. For people who do switch products, it is recommended that their TSH and free T4 levels be tested after six weeks to check that they are within normal range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with hypersensitivity to <b>levothyroxine</b> sodium or any component of the formulation, people with acute myocardial infarction, and people with thyrotoxicosis of any etiology. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is also contraindicated for people with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency, as thyroid hormones may cause an acute adrenal crisis by increasing the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. For oral tablets, the inability to swallow capsules serves as an additional contraindication.|$|E
50|$|In dogs {{treated for}} {{hypothyroidism}} (lack of thyroid hormone), hyperthyroidism may {{occur as a}} result of an overdose of the thyroid hormone replacement medication, levothyroxine; in this case treatment involves reducing the dose of <b>levothyroxine.</b> Dogs which display coprophagy, that is, which often eat feces, and which live in a household with a dog receiving <b>levothyroxine</b> treatment, may develop hyperthryoidism if they frequently eat the feces from the dog receiving <b>levothyroxine</b> treatment.|$|E
50|$|There are {{foods and}} other {{substances}} that {{can interfere with}} absorption of thyroxine. Examples include calcium and iron supplements taken within four hours of <b>levothyroxine,</b> Other substances that reduce absorption are aluminium and magnesium containing antacids, simethicone, sucralfate, cholestyramine, colestipol, and polystyrene sulfonate. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of <b>levothyroxine,</b> but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20-30 (8 men, 2 women) {{it may not have}} a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of <b>levothyroxine,</b> though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of <b>levothyroxine</b> with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. On the other hand, lithium can cause hyperthyroidism (but most often hypothyroidism) by affecting iodine metabolism of the thyroid itself and thus inhibits synthetic <b>levothyroxine</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|Patients are {{administered}} hormone replacement <b>levothyroxine</b> for life after surgery, especially after total thyroidectomy. Chemotherapy with cisplatin or doxorubicin has proven limited efficacy, however, {{it could be}} helpful for patients with bone metastases to improve their quality of life. Patients are also prescribed <b>levothyroxine</b> and radioiodine after surgery. <b>Levothyroxine</b> influences growth and maturation of tissues and it is involved in normal growth, metabolism, and development. In case of metastases, patients are prescribed antineoplastic agents which inhibit cell growth and proliferation and help in palliating symptoms in progressive disease.|$|E

50|$|Absorption of orally {{administered}} <b>levothyroxine</b> {{from the}} gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40 to 80%, {{with the majority}} of the drug absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. <b>Levothyroxine</b> absorption is increased by fasting and decreased in certain malabsorption syndromes, by certain foods, and with age. The bioavailability of the drug is decreased by dietary fiber.|$|E
50|$|Desiccated Thyroid {{became a}} {{commercial}} treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid,. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) {{began to be}} replaced by <b>levothyroxine</b> (T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed <b>levothyroxine</b> or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> is a {{synthetic}} form of thyroxine (T4), an endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, which {{is converted to}} its active metabolite, L-triiodothyronine (T3). T4 and T3 bind to thyroid receptor proteins in the cell nucleus and cause metabolic effects through the control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Like its naturally secreted counterpart, <b>levothyroxine</b> is a chiral compound in the L-form.|$|E
50|$|While {{a minimal}} amount of thyroid hormones {{are found in}} breast milk, the amount does not {{influence}} infant plasma thyroid levels. Furthermore, <b>levothyroxine</b> was not found to cause any adverse events to the infant or mother during breastfeeding. As adequate concentrations of thyroid hormone are required to maintain normal lactation, {{it is recommended that}} appropriate <b>levothyroxine</b> doses be administered during breastfeeding.|$|E
50|$|Drug-interaction {{studies and}} post hoc {{analyses}} of Phase 3 studies showed no clinically relevant interaction of sucroferric oxyhydroxide with the systemic exposures to losartan, furosemide, omeprazole, digoxin, and warfarin, the lipid-lowering effects of statins, and oral vitamin D receptor agonists. According to the European label (Summary of Product Characteristics), medicinal {{products that are}} known to interact with iron (e.g. doxycycline) or {{have the potential to}} interact with Velphoro should be administered at least one hour before or two hours after Velphoro. This allows sucroferric oxyhydroxide to bind phosphate as intended and be excreted without coming into contact with medications in the gut that it might interact with. According to the US prescribing information, Velphoro should not be prescribed with oral <b>levothyroxine.</b> The combination of sucroferric oxyhydroxide and <b>levothyroxine</b> is contraindicated because sucroferric oxyhydroxide contains iron, which may cause <b>levothyroxine</b> to become insoluble in the gut, thereby preventing the intestinal absorption of <b>levothyroxine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Physicians may use {{liothyronine}} {{instead of}} or {{in addition to}} <b>levothyroxine</b> (T4) for patients undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal. When a patient has thyroid cancer or Graves' disease, ablation therapy with radioactive iodine (131I) {{can be used to}} remove trace thyroid tissue that may remain after thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). For 131I therapy to be effective, the trace thyroid tissue must be avid to iodine, which is achieved by elevating the patient's TSH levels. For patients taking <b>levothyroxine,</b> TSH may be boosted by discontinuing <b>levothyroxine</b> for 3-6 weeks. This long period of hormone withdrawal is required because of levothyroxine's relatively long biological half-life, and may result in symptoms of hypothyroidism in the patient. The shorter half-life of liothyronine permits a withdrawal period of two weeks, which may minimize hypothyroidism symptoms. One protocol is to discontinue <b>levothyroxine,</b> then prescribe liothyronine while the T4 levels are falling, and finally stop the liothyronine two weeks before the radioactive iodine treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> {{was first}} made in 1927. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.58 to 12.28 USD a month. In the United States a typical month of treatment is less than 25 USD.|$|E
50|$|Dosages vary {{according}} to the age groups and the individual condition of the person, body weight and compliance to the medication and diet. Other predictors of the required dosage are sex, BMI, deiodinase activity (SPINA-GD) and etiology of hypothyroidism. Annual or semiannual clinical evaluations and TSH monitoring are appropriate after dosing has been established. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is taken on an empty stomach approximately half an hour to an hour before meals. As such, thyroid replacement therapy is usually taken 30 minutes prior to eating in the morning. For patients with trouble taking <b>levothyroxine</b> in the morning, bedtime dosing is effective as well. A recent study published in JAMA showed greater efficacy of <b>levothyroxine</b> when taken at bedtime.|$|E
50|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4-8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in <b>levothyroxine</b> dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is best taken 30-60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of <b>levothyroxine.</b> There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
50|$|Hypothyroidism {{can arise}} from a {{multitude}} of causes, and is commonly remedied with hormone treatments such as the commonly used <b>Levothyroxine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> is a {{stereoisomer}} of thyroxine {{which is}} degraded much slower {{and can be}} administered once daily in patients with hypothyroidism.|$|E
50|$|Liothyronine {{may also}} be {{preferred}} for patients with myxedema coma because of its quicker onset of action when compared to <b>levothyroxine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} hypothyroidism, and is the treatment of choice for people with hypothyroidism, who often require lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. It may {{also be used to}} treat goiter via its ability to lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone that is considered goiter-inducing. <b>Levothyroxine</b> is also used as interventional therapy in people with nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. A subset of people with hypothyroidism treated with an appropriate dose of <b>levothyroxine</b> will describe continuing symptoms despite TSH levels in the normal range. In these people, further laboratory and clinical evaluation is warranted as they may have another cause for their symptoms. Furthermore, it is important to review their medications and possible dietary supplements as several medications can affect thyroid hormone levels.|$|E
