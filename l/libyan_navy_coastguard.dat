50|$|A few navies {{still have}} {{dedicated}} minelayers in commission, {{including those of}} South Korea, Poland, Sweden and Finland; countries with long, shallow coastlines where sea mines are most effective. Other navies have plans to create extemporised minelayers in times of war, for example by rolling sea-mines into the sea from the vehicle deck through the open aft doors of a Roll-on/roll-off ferry. In 1984 the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> was suspected of having mined the Red Sea a few nautical {{miles south of the}} Suez Canal using the Ro-Ro ferry Ghat, other nations suspected of having similar wartime plans include Iran and North Korea.|$|R
50|$|The Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya {{consisted}} of the Libyan Army, Libyan Air Force and the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> and other services including the People's Militia. In November 2010, before the Libyan Civil War in 2011, {{the total number of}} Libyan personnel was estimated at 76,000 though that war wore the military's numbers away. There was no separate defence ministry; all defence activities were centralised under Gaddafi. There was a High Command of the Armed Forces (al-Qiyada al-ulya lil-quwwat al-musallaha). Arms production was limited and manufacturers were state-owned. Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was the last minister of defence of the Gaddafi-era military.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2013 Echo was in {{the central}} Mediterranean {{surveying}} the approaches to the ports of Tripoli and Khoms {{on the coast of}} Libya to improve Admiralty charts of the area. She was looking for wrecks that might be hazards to shipping. In 10 days she found the wrecks of one liner, two merchant ships, one landing craft, two fishing vessels, two barges and two large sunken pontoons. She also found {{at least half a dozen}} lost shipping containers. The landing craft is believed to be the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> [...] Ibn Qis, which was burnt out on exercise in 1978.|$|R

A rescue attempt involving the Italian and <b>Libyan</b> <b>navies</b> rescued 21 survivors from the boat and retrieved 21 bodies. A further 77 bodies subsequently washed up on the shores of Libya before rescue efforts were called off. Two other boats also went missing between Libya and Italy, carrying around 250 more people between them. A fourth boat, carrying 350 people, was rescued by an Italian merchant ship on 29 March in the same area of sea.|$|R
40|$|The Asia-Pacific {{region is}} now universally {{regarded}} as the primary driver of global economic growth focused on North Asia, with major contributing economies being China, Japan, the Republic of Korea (RoK) and Taiwan. Importantly, they all rely on seaborne trade and significantly for some of them, a very high dependence on imported energy which comes, in the main, from the Middle East. These energy shipments are vulnerable to disruption, although actual threats vary between transit sectors and potential attackers (state and non-state actors). As most disruption scenarios could occur at sea, maritime forces (<b>navies,</b> <b>coastguards</b> and marine police) would have {{a major role in}} deterring such attacks or responding to them. But the maritime battlespace, {{for want of a better}} term, has grown increasingly complex, with varying jurisdictions, maritime boundary disputes, an opaque international shipping industry, and widely disparate capabilities and responsibilities of maritime forces...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1997, the Turkish <b>Navy</b> and <b>Coastguard</b> {{began to}} board and search vessels heading to Cyprus, {{including}} Russian-flagged vessels in international waters.

5000|$|HMS Greetham {{was one of}} 93 {{ships of}} the [...] of inshore {{minesweeper}}s. All ships in this class had names chosen from villages ending in -ham. The minesweeper was built by the firm of Herd & McKenzie in Buckie, Moray and was named after Greetham, Lincolnshire. Entering service in 1955, the vessel {{was transferred to the}} <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> in 1962 on loan and permanently in 1966. Renamed Zuara, the minesweeper was used as a patrol vessel until 1973. Zuara was sold to Captain Morgan Cruises of Malta for commercial use and renamed Lady Davinia. The ship was taken out of service in 2007 and laid up at Sliema Creek. Lady Davinia sank at her moorings in 2008 and in 2011 was the wreck partially broken up after being named a navigational hazard.|$|R
25|$|The motive that is {{generally}} attributed to Libya {{can be traced}} back to a series of military confrontations with the US Navy that took place in the 1980s in the Gulf of Sidra, the whole of which Libya claimed as its territorial waters. First, there was the Gulf of Sidra incident (1981) when two Libyan fighter aircraft were shot down by two US Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters. Then, two Libyan radio ships were sunk in the Gulf of Sidra. Later, on 23 March 1986 a <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> patrol boat was sunk in the Gulf of Sidra, followed by the sinking of another Libyan vessel on 25 March 1986. The Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was accused of retaliating for these sinkings by ordering 5 April 1986 bombing of West Berlin nightclub, La Belle, that was frequented by US military personnel and which killed three and injured 230.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1980 Richmond K. Turner {{participated in}} Boston's OPSAIL 80 {{and may have}} been awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for {{conducting}} two special operations, but this award is not listed in the US Navy Unit award website. Richmond K. Turner completed four highly successful Mediterranean deployments as part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, prior to an extensive baseline overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina from January to December 1982. During this overhaul Richmond K. Turner received numerous updates to modernize its combat systems suite. It was also fitted with the Vulcan Phalanx Close in Weapons System (CIWS) for self-defense against cruise missiles. After this overhaul Richmond K. Turner completed two more Mediterranean deployments. [...] The ship received both Navy Expeditionary Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation during this employment. During the Action in the Gulf of Sidra against the <b>Libyan</b> <b>navy,</b> the Turner disabled a Libyan patrol boat with a Harpoon missile.|$|R
50|$|On 10 June, the GNA {{captured}} two barracks, {{a bridge}} and an intersection in Sirte. In addition, the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> secured Sirte's coast and blocked potential escape routes for ISIL via the sea. The following day, street fighting continued to rage in Sirte and heavy clashes took place around the Ouagadougou complex, with GNA forces hitting with artillery fire ISIL positions around the conference centre. On 12 June, GNA forces secured both Sirte's port, airport and a residential {{area in the}} east of the city, while fighting was continuing two kilometers from the conference hall. ISIL fighters in the city retreated into a densely built-up area, with snipers taking up positions against the advancing GNA forces. ISIL also started using waves of suicide-bombers to stall approaching GNA forces. Three ISIL suicide car-bombers targeted a field hospital in the west of Sirte, as well as two positions of GNA fighters, including at the Abu Hadi roundabout in the southeast of the city.|$|R
50|$|The AS.12 {{originally}} entered {{service with}} the French Navy in 1960 in the air-to-surface role against ships and submarines on the surface. In 1966 the French Navy made {{an evaluation of}} the SS.11(M) and SS.12(M) from the fast patrol boat La Combattante. In 1966, the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Navy</b> ordered three fast patrol boats from Vosper (Sebha, Sirte and Susa). Delivered in 1968, these were the first operational naval vessels to be armed with AS.12(M) with four launch rails {{on each side of the}} vessel's bridge. The Libyan fast patrol boats proved to be a very low cost way to give long-range heavy firepower to small naval vessels. Other navies soon followed Libya and bought the SS.12(M) and SS.11(M) for their light naval vessels; among them Brunei, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Tunisia. Sweden bought the SS.12(M) (designated the Robot 54) as a heavier support for the SS.11(M) (designated Robot 52). NORD also developed a ten-missile trainable launcher for either the AS.11(M) or AS.12(M) which was sold in numbers due to its cost-effective firepower.|$|R
