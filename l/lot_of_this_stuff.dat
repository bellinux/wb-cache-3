So I've done quite a few of these sort of impromptu new music concerts for small groups of detectives and customs agents and I'd have to keep setting all this stuff up and they'd listen for a while and they'd say: So uh, what's this? And I'd pull out something like(Bergamot:) this filter, and say, now this is what I like to think of as the voice of authority. And it would take me a while to tell them how I used it for songs that were, you know, about various forms of control, and they would say, now {{why would you want to}} talk like that? And I'd look around at the SWAT teams, and the undercover agents, and the dogs, and the radio in the corner, tuned to the Super Bowl coverage of the war. And I'd say, take a wild guess.|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The fist chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth:I've always tried to insert positivity into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff.

She stated [...] "I think that you grow as an artist, and for me, I'm so {{inspired}} {{by a lot of}} different artists. I think probably being a young artist, {{there were a lot of}} things I wanted to do. And then it took me in a different direction with [...] "I Think We're Alone Now," [...] and then all of a sudden I was a pop star. But I loved it. My dreams had come true, but then there was also that side of, [...] "You're a young teen," [...] and there were so many people telling me, [...] "You can't do that now. You can't dress like this. You can't date boys." [...] It was like all of a sudden the world was watching, but it was mainly the corporate world, the business side of it, and it was very frustrating, because my fans were changing; they were growing up. The girls were dressing more sexy; music was changing. Now I'm in a semi-pop dance world, and I'm singing a lot of ballads, which are beautiful, well-written songs, but that's not why people buy tickets to come and see me, and that's not how I came out of the box with people. So that's kind of where [...] "New Inside" [...] came from. I definitely wanted to write. I had changed management at that time, because I was saying, [...] "It's time to grow up. It's time to be a little more edgy. It's time to be a little bit more tuned-in. If we're going to do dance music, then let's really do dance music." [...] I come from a dancer's background. We're not even tapping into a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> that would be a lot of fun for me, and I'm surrounded by a lot of great, talented people. I'm very lucky with that; why don't we use some of this and grow a little bit? A lot of the people I was working with didn't want to do that, so I found a whole new camp." ...|$|E
