They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany.

40|$|The {{furniture}} industry {{is one of}} the most important in the United States. It employs thousands of people and generates billions of dollars annually in value added manufacturing. Any productivity improvement in this industry will have a significant effect on costs and market competitiveness. Currently, most furniture manufacturers are interested in a strategic approach to the improvement of productivity and quality in their industry. ^ Changing market trends in the {{furniture industry}} call for high quality products and efficient manufacturing processes that will promote cost reduction, customer satisfaction, and fulfillment of higher quality standards. ^ The lack of an integrated total quality program in the furniture industry generates many problems. These problems include high levels of work in process and high inventory levels of parts and subassemblies in intermediate stages of the manufacturing process, and long lead times. Poor relationships among suppliers, manufacturers and customers, and the loss of customer confidence result from these problems. ^ The primary purposes in applying these tools are (a) to define the most important variables which affect the manufacturing system, (b) to identify the more important parameters that influence the final quality of the products, and (c) to design a methodology of selection which will help to identify the variables that have important impact in the final product quality. ^ The goal of this research is to identify the most important parameters that influence final quality in chair manufacturing. To apply an appropriate dynamic analysis that permits evaluation of the entire system, and to determine the most important variables in the system. In addition to a <b>linkages</b> <b>analysis</b> among important factors that include quality, cost, and productivity was completed.

25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is used for}} more than an initial diagnosis. It is used to confirm {{diagnostic}} testing, for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 85% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis. Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are submicroscopic deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is <b>linkage</b> <b>analysis,</b> which is used when the first two are unavailable. <b>Linkage</b> <b>analysis</b> is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{promotion}} of regionalisation {{is part of}} the foreign policy of the European Union (EU). However, a closer understanding of the mechanisms by which its policies work towards this goal is lacking.

Cross-border management fulfils a similar technical role for the promotion of security linkages. Concerning cultural linkages, Georgia is analysed as a hub for common socialisation and people-to-people contacts.

25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} by <b>linkage</b> <b>analysis</b> or direct {{mutation}} screening is clinically available; however, genetic heterogeneity {{is a significant}} complication to molecular genetic testing. Sometimes a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested {{in order to establish}} which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked allelic heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problematic}} case is {{the cases}} of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients {{do not wish to}} know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a <b>linkage</b> <b>analysis</b> with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.|$|E

One was an X {{chromosome}} <b>linkage</b> <b>analysis</b> of 54 pairs of gay brothers {{carried out by the}} independent research group of Sanders et al. in 1998. The results of the study were indistinguishable from {{the results of the study}} by Hu et al.: both reported that the chromosomal location of maximum sharing was locus DXS1108 and both reported similar degrees of allele sharing (66% versus 67%). The second study by Rice et al. in 1999 studied 52 pairs of Canadian gay brothers and found no statistically significant linkage in alleles and haplotypes. Consequently, they concluded against the possibility of any gene in the Xq28 region having a large genetic influence on male sexual orientation (though they could not rule out the possibility of a gene in this region having a small influence). Rice et al. also asserted that their results do not exclude the possibility of finding male homosexuality genes elsewhere in the genome. Hamer criticized the study for not selecting families for their study population based on maternal transmission as selecting only families that show an excess of maternal gay relatives is necessary to detect the Xq28 linkage. A meta-analysis of all [...] data available at that time (i.e., Hamer et al. (1993), Hu et al. (1995), Rice et al.
