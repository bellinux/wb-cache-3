25|$|The 2013 models gain a new {{front end}} sheet metal along with {{standard}} HID headlamps, {{along with a}} new LED tail <b>light</b> <b>assembly.</b> Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach 200+mph safely. Ford says the changes {{have resulted in a}} 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 is a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function is standard, as is four-mode electronic stability control.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 {{models have}} various {{improvements}} and differences {{compared to the}} GT500 of 2012 including new front end sheet metal along with standard HID headlamps, along with a new LED tail <b>light</b> <b>assembly.</b> The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also has no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the modifications needed for Australian standards and market requirements, changes included the use of [...] "local content" [...] sourced parts and components (such as seats, carpeting, lights, heaters, and even unique [...] "R"-logo wheel covers) that reduced the tariff added to each car. All AMI Matadors were right-hand drive and continued to use the dash and instrument dials of the U.S 1967 Rambler Ambassador. Also reused throughout the whole production run was the split-bench front seat and door cards of the U.S 1971 Matador which were both Australian-made. Despite the reused interior, all exterior model year changes corresponded to those of U.S. production As red rear flashers were prohibited in Australia, amber-coloured trailer lights were retrofitted {{to the rear of}} all AMI-assembled Matadors, drilled into the tail gate of the station wagons or mounted over or behind the reversing lens of the tail <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> of the sedans, and then re wired so the turn signals would flash orange.|$|E

40|$|Light is {{undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} environmental variable for plant growth and development; plants not only use radiant energy in photosynthesis, they also respond to the quantity, quality, direction and timing of incident radiation through photomorphogenic response that can have huge effects on {{the rate of growth}} and the pattern of development. It is surprising, therefore, that the manufacturers and suppliers of controlled environment facilities have been singularly uninventive {{in the design of the}} <b>lighting</b> <b>assemblies</b> they provide. The consumer has one choice only - a <b>lighting</b> <b>assembly</b> that provides irradiance levels usually only a fraction of sunlight, and a control system that is limited to regulating the timing of the on-off switch. The reasons for these limitations are partly technological, but in the main they result from ignorance on the part of both the consumer and the manufacturer. A specific and powerful example of this ignorance relates to the importance of the so-called far-red wavelengths (FR = 700 - 800 nm). Because the human eye can hardly detect wavelengths above 700 nm, and photosynthesis also cuts off at about 700 nm, the majority of plant and crop physiologists are still almost completely unaware that FR radiation can have massive effects on growth rate and development. In consequence, most growth cabinets have light sources based on fluorescent tubes, and provide very little FR apart from that emitted by a token number of small incandescent bulbs. Larger growth facilities often use broader spectrum light sources, but growth facilities that provide the capability to vary the FR incident upon the plants are about as abundant as seals in the Sahara. This article sets the background of the significance of FR radiation in the natural environment and its importance for plant growth and development in the hope that it might inform intelligently those concerned with improving the design of plant growth facilities...|$|R
