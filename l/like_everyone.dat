5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. <b>Like</b> <b>everyone</b> else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot {{tolerate}} his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems {{to be only a}} nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{distribution}} of ‘list readings’ in questions <b>like</b> who does <b>everyone</b> <b>like?</b> vs. who <b>likes</b> <b>everyone?.</b> More generally, it focuses on the interaction between w&words and quantified NPs. It is argued that, contrary to widespread belief, the pattern of available readings of constituent questions can be explained {{as a consequence of}} Weak Crossover, a well-known property of grammar. In particular, list readings are claimed to be a special case of ‘functional readings’, rather than arising from quantifying into questions. Functional readings are argued to be encoded in the syntax as doubly indexed traces, which straightforwardly leads to a Crossover account of the absence of list readings in who likes evevone?. Empirical and theoretical consequences of this idea for the syntax and semantics of questions are considered...|$|R

25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. <b>Like</b> <b>everyone</b> else in the British Empire, Canadians were {{subjects}} of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on}} the Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} {{formulated}} and preparations were completed by January 642. The success of plan depended upon how effectively Umar {{would be able}} to coordinate these attacks from Madinah, about 1500 kilometers from the battlefields in Persia and upon the skills and abilities of his field commanders. Umar appointed his best field commanders to conquer the Sassanid Empire and bring down his most formidable foe, Yazdegerd III. The campaign saw a different pattern in command structure. Instead of appointing a single field commander to campaign across the Persian lands, Umar appointed several commanders, each assigned a different mission. Once the mission would end the commander would become an ordinary soldier under the command of the new field commander for the latter's mission. The purpose of this strategy was to allow commanders to mix in with their soldiers and to remind them that they are <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else; command is only given to those most competent, and once the battle is over, the commander returns to his previous position.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

The drummer's doing a Krautrock thang, while your guitarist is on a decidedly math-rock kick. What's the singer's up to is anyone's guess, although it's probably fair to say he's experimenting with the art of singing over something which proves that very feat impossible." ...|$|R
