40|$|This master`s thesis {{deals with}} {{low-temperature}} heating that employs a heat pump. The introduction gives reasons for {{utilization of the}} renewable heat sources for heating. The next part focuses on a practical application of renewables on the heating of a family house. It covers {{a detailed description of}} the building and the designed heating system which includes: the calculation of thermal losses, design of the <b>low-temperature</b> <b>boiler,</b> heat pump, safety devices, heating elements, sizing and control of the system. The last part is devoted to the assessment of the system performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of audit surveys {{concerning}} modernization of heating systems in middle-sized towns (of 16 to 65 thousand inhabitants), a technical-economic analysis {{as well as an}} ecological analysis of feasible investment projects were performed. The audit surveys concentrated mainly on 152 local <b>low-temperature</b> <b>boiler</b> houses with low emission sources in selected towns of the north-eastern Poland. The audit surveys mentioned above involved also measurements of the amounts of SO 2 and particulate matter polluting the air. The fundamental purpose of the suggested modernization of the researched heating systems was to improve the very low operating efficiency of the boiler houses (mainly with low emission sources) under concern, as well as-or perhaps above all- to reduce levels of SO 2 and particulate matter polluting the air. One of the criteria applied in the economic assessment of the suggested projects (investments) was the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas {{in the case of the}} ecological assessment- reducing air pollution...|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} problematics of offtake of flue gasses. In {{experimental}} part there was measured compound of flue gasses by analyzator of flue gates. Aplication {{is a project}} of heating of object of The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Brno. Project solves design of heating system, flue and of source of heat. Heating area is created by floor convectors,towel rails and radiators. Source of heat is designed in two variants : as a cascade of condensation boilers and as a cascade of <b>low-temperature</b> <b>boilers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{structure of}} the fuel balance in Ukraine does largely determine high prices of such energy products as the electricity and the heat. The main reason {{lies in the fact}} that approximately 40 % of the fuel balance represents the expensive imported liquid and gaseous fuels. Of course, such balance structure significantly affects the energy security of Ukraine. The article analyzes the three main directions of this situation possible normalization: replacing the imported gas with relatively inexpensive domestic coal burned at boilers and innovative coal-fired burner systems, especially in the <b>low-temperature</b> <b>boilers</b> with fluidized bed furnaces; replacement of imported fuel with respectively cheap pyrolysis gas obtained from the domestic low-grade brown coal; organization of domestic production of shale gas, which industrial production is scheduled for 2020. These promising directions of the national energetics’ fuel balance development can be considered as a priority part of the national tasks of increasing the country’s energy independence...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{pertains}} to heating practices of low-energy houses using a heat pump (example 1) and <b>low-temperature</b> condensing <b>boiler</b> (example 2). The {{first part of}} the work contains calculations of suggested building’s heat efficiency and of under-floor heating. The second part of the work includes estimates of seasonal heating factors for construction with a heat pump. Based on the comparison: both of these heating systems are recommended; the capacity of the warm water container is established; and safety elements are chosen. Furthermore, a system of regulation for warm water heating is determined, and a curve of equithermal regulation for heating is calculated. Both of the recommended heating possibilities include calculations of costs of supplies and manufacturing, as well as blueprints for construction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of results on CO, NO, and SO 2 emission recorded when burning pellets of oil cake, rape straw, and birch sawdust in the <b>low-temperature</b> water <b>boiler</b> of the top combustion. The air was supplied to the boiler through a fan under the grate at a speed of 1 m·s- 1 and 2. 5 m·s- 1. There were significantly different emissions of CO, NO and SO 2 under varying conditions of airflow supply to the boiler. Emissions of NO and SO 2 depended mainly on nitrogen and sulfur contents in the biomass, while CO emissions were mainly dependent {{on the amount of}} supplied air. Such heating devices allow for ecological combustion of pellets made of a plant biomass, but air distribution needs to be improved. It is advisable to develop nomograms to facilitate the selection of airflow speed in relation to the biofuel used for a specific boiler type, ensuring its use in accordance with the concept of sustainable development...|$|R
