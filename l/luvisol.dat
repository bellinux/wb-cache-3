40|$|Abstract – Soil {{productivity}} is generally associated with poor nutrient {{status and the}} physical condition of the soil, but the effect of soil mineralogy on soil productivity has received little attention. In this qualitative study, interactions between mineralogy and physico-chemistry and their role on the productivity of two <b>luvisols,</b> an arenosol and a vertisol are investigated. Minerals identified in the soils included smectites in the vertisol, kaolinite, quartz, hydromica, albite and biotite in the <b>luvisols</b> and arenosol. The presence of smectite in the vertisol has resulted in it having a higher organic matter content, higher cation exchange capacity, higher water holding capacity, and low bulk density than both <b>luvisols</b> and the arenosol. Both <b>luvisols</b> and the arenosol were dominated by quartz, feldspars and kaolinite, which are chemically inert compared to smectite and have fewer effects on soil cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, and bulk density. The effect of soil mineralogy and physico-chemistry on the productivity of these soils {{is reflected in the}} yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea variety Fordhook giant) grown on the different soils where spinach yield on the vertisol was the highest followed by that of the <b>luvisols</b> and then the arenosol...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study were}} to explore long-term dynamics of soil organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and the consequences for crop-available N and P to support the design of sustainable farm management practices for higher yields and improved livelihoods in the Northern Highlands of Ethiopia. Simplified soil N and P dynamics modules are described. C dynamics have been linked to the dynamics of organic N via the C:N ratio. The model has been calibrated on the basis of empirical data from the study area. The N and OC modules have been validated on the basis of an empirical data set for fields continuously cultivated for 7 - 53 years in smallholder farms in the Highlands of Ethiopia. The model has been applied for exploration of long-term dynamics of soil N, OC and P and crop available N and P under alternative farm management regimes. The simulation results indicate that, in terms of soil OC, the control management results in 44, 42 and 38 % depletion, respectively, in Cambisols, <b>Luvisols</b> and Leptosols; current management practice (Alt 1) results in 16 % reduction in Cambisols, 32 % in <b>Luvisols,</b> but a 22 % increase in Leptosols; Alt 2 (returning all non-economic organic material to the soil) results in 27 % reduction in <b>Luvisols,</b> whereas in Cambisols and Leptosols it increases by 1 and 57 %, respectively, after 50 years of cultivation. The rates of changes in soil N are similar to those in OC under current management, Alt 1 and Alt 2. In terms of total soil P, the control management and Alt 2 result in 46 and 43 % depletion in Cambisols and 53 and 52 % in <b>Luvisols</b> over the 50 years. On the other hand, Alt 1 results in build-up of total soil P in Cambisols (69 % higher after 50 years), but still to depletion (8 %) in <b>Luvisols.</b> All other management regimes are not 'sustainable' in terms of soil N, OC and P, and lead to 'soil mining'. Finally, the model has been used to estimate the required organic amendments and inorganic P inputs to maintain the current status of soil OC and P, as a benchmark of management practices. To maintain the current status of soil OC, the required composted organic amendments were 5. 3, 15. 0 and 2. 1 Mg ha- 1 annually for Cambisols, <b>Luvisols</b> and Leptosols, respectively. To maintain the current soil P-levels, required inorganic P-doses (in addition to organic P contributions from composted organic fertilizer from 5. 3 (in Cambisols) and 15. 0 (in <b>Luvisols)</b> Mg ha- 1 year- 1) were 8 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in Cambisols and 23 kg in <b>Luvisols.</b> The model is relatively easy to parameterize for specific situations and reproduces the most important aspects of soil nutrient dynamics.

Yet there is little understanding of the impact of management on the nutrient supply potential in soils (particularly, P and S). To quantify N, P and S availability from SOM, surface soils (0 – 10 cm) were collected from 14 management practices across three long-term (16 – 46 years) experimental sites under semi-arid (<b>Luvisol),</b> Mediterranean (<b>Luvisol)</b> and sub-tropical (Vertisol) environments in Australia. The practices comprised conventional (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) with mixed farming, no-till with continuous cropping (NT), and perennial pasture (PP) in the semi-arid <b>Luvisol,</b> while in a Mediterranean direct-drilled continuous cropping system, stubble was either retained (SR) or burnt (SB). Practices on the Vertisol comprised a factorial combination of CT, NT, SR, SB with either 0 (0 N) or 90 kg urea-N ha (90 N) in a continuous cropping system. Soils were incubated under controlled soil moisture and temperature, and cumulative organic C mineralised (C), and net available N, P and S were measured over 126 days. In the semi-arid <b>Luvisol,</b> CT and/or RT showed significantly higher C and net available N, P and S than NT and PP. In the Mediterranean <b>Luvisol,</b> C and net available P were not influenced by stubble management. In the Vertisol, CT-SR (cf.

CT-SR/SB without N fertilisation and NT-SR and/or -SB with or without N fertilisation) significantly increased net available N and P. This study found a continuous release of net available N (11 – 49 kg N ha over 126 days) across all management practices, whereas, the release of available P and S was evident only during the first 30 days (6 – 74 kg P ha, − 4 to 22 kg S ha), after which microbial immobilisation or clay fixation of P and S predominated, particularly in the Vertisol.
