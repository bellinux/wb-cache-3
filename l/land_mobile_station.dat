In larger metropolitan areas with congested frequency spectrum, paging services will often share the same frequency as <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>stations,</b> or operate on an adjacent channel.

Or, a restaurant will use 467.7500 MHz to alert customers when their table is ready (using so-called [...] "coaster pagers") while a department store nearby uses 467.7500 MHz for their in-store communications.

40|$|The {{application}} of XML-based approaches in passing vulnerability information between vulnerability management devices or software residing on wired networks has been demonstrated. We propose a {{proof of concept}} framework for mobile operators that extends this use of XML into the area of vulnerability management on public <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> networks. Our proposed framework allows for a pro-active central management of vulnerabilities found on <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> such as <b>mobile</b> phones. Despite the relatively limited number of reported vulnerabilities on <b>mobile</b> <b>stations,</b> such a pre-emptive approach from mobile operators is necessary to acquire the confidence of early adopters in Mobile Commerce. Given the diverse collection of devices and software that exist on a public <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> network, XML-based approaches are best able to providing the inter-operability required for vulnerability management on such a network. Our proposed framework leverages web services by using the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to provide vulnerability descriptions, and by securing these descriptions in SOAP messages conforming to the OASIS Web Services Security (WSS) standard. We contribute in three areas: firstly, through this framework we show that mobile operators can carry out centralized vulnerability management on their public <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> networks comprising {{of a wide variety}} of devices and software. Secondly, the assurance of integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation inherently lacking in OVAL vulnerability descriptions is achieved through their encapsulation in SOAP messages conforming to the OASIS WSS standard.

40|$|Information systems {{consist of}} {{multiple}} <b>mobile</b> <b>stations</b> and fixed stations communicating with each other.

5000|$|Internal Roaming: The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> (MS) {{moves from}} one access point (AP) to another AP within a home network if the signal {{strength}} is too weak.

40|$|Fades on {{satellite}} to <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> radio links {{are caused by}} several factors, {{the most important of}} which are multipath propagation and vegetative shadowing.
