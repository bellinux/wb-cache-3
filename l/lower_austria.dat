5|$|Walter Nowotny {{was born}} in Gmünd, {{a small town in}} <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria.</b> His father, Rudolf Nowotny, was a railway official; his two brothers, Rudolf and Hubert, became {{officers}} in the Wehrmacht. Hubert Nowotny was killed in action in the Battle of Stalingrad. From 1925to 1935, his family lived in Schwarzenau until his father was relocated to Mistelbach, north of Vienna. Walter attended the primary school (Volksschule) in Schwarzenau before graduating to the Bundesoberrealschule in Waidhofen an der Thaya.

5|$|In central Europe, {{this species}} has been {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} Austrian Danube, where it was first recorded in Tulln, <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria</b> in 2001. In the Czech Republic, it is now extinct in Bohemia; the only findings were in the Elbe river near Litoměřice in 1917, {{and the most recent}} findings of empty shells took place in 1943. Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland, in Slovakia where it is non-indigenous since 2002, and in Hungary. Zettler (2008) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution of T. fluviatilis in Germany. The indigenous distribution of T. fluviatilis included all of the large rivers: Rhine, Main, Moselle, Neckar, Weser, Elbe and Oder. However, this species is now highly endangered in Germany (Stark gefährdet).|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{concluded}} {{an alliance}} with the Teutonic Knights and the Bishopric of Ermland against Poland in March 1477. However, instead of Poland, he declared war on Emperor Frederick after he learnt that the Emperor had confirmed Vladislaus Jagiellon's position as King of Bohemia and Prince-elector. Matthias invaded <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria</b> and imposed a blockade on Vienna. Vladislaus Jagiellon denied to support the Emperor, forcing him to seek reconciliation with Matthias. With the mediation of Pope Sixtus IV, Venice, and Ferdinand I of Naples, Matthias concluded a peace treaty with Frederick III, which was signed on 1 December. The Emperor promised to confirm Matthias as the lawful ruler of Bohemia and to pay him an indemnity of 100,000 florins. They met in Korneuburg where Frederick III installed Matthias as King of Bohemia and Matthias swore loyalty to the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|An Ottoman army {{supported}} by Basarab Țepeluș of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and {{set fire to}} Szászváros (now Orăștie in Romania) in late 1479. Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi annihilated the marauders in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October. Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube {{to the west of}} Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier. Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as Sarajevo in Bosnia in November. He set up five defensive provinces, or banates, centred around the forts of Szörényvár (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade, Šabac, Srebrenik and Jajce. The next year, Matthias initiated a criminal case against the Frankapans, the Zrinskis and other leading Croatian and Slavonian magnates for their alleged participation in the 1471 conspiracy. Most barons were pardoned as soon as they consented to the introduction of a new land tax. In 1481, for a loan of 100,000 florins, Matthias seized the town of Mautern in Styria and Sankt Pölten in <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria</b> from Friedrich Mauerkircher, one of the two candidates to the Bishopric of Passau.|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{introduced}} {{new taxes}} and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in Transylvania in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias {{declared war on}} George of Poděbrady, the Hussite King of Bohemia, and conquered Moravia, Silesia, and Lausitz, {{but he could not}} occupy Bohemia proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Poděbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected Vladislaus Jagiellon, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother Casimir, but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at Breslau in Silesia (now Wrocław in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia, enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized Šabac, an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria</b> between 1482 and 1487.|$|E
5|$|Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma {{was born}} at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. The unusual name Zita was given her after a popular Italian Saint {{who had lived in}} Tuscany in the 13th century. She was the third {{daughter}} and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Zita's father had lost his throne {{as a result of the}} movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child. He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young). Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita's mother. The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert's 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore (a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio) and his castle in Schwarzau in <b>lower</b> <b>Austria.</b> It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria moving to Pianore in the Winter and returning in the Summer. To move between them, they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings.|$|E
25|$|In Austria, Pinot noir {{is usually}} called Blauburgunder (literally Blue Burgundy) and {{produced}} in Burgenland and <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria.</b> Austrian Pinot noir wines are dry red wines similar in character {{to the red}} wines of Burgundy, mostly aged in French barriques.

5000|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} improve the sewing machine, in 1839 he built a machine imitating the weaving process using the chain stitch. Madersperger was out of money, so he could not set up a factory. He donated the prototype to the k.k. polytechnical institute ( [...] the predecessor of the technical university [...] ). In 1841 he received a bronze medal from the <b>lower</b> <b>Austrias</b> business society. Madersperger died on 2 October 1850, staying with his wife for only 3 months in Vienna's almshouse. He is buried in a common grave at the St. Marx Cemetery. Vienna's tailors guild erected a crucifix made of cast iron, and continues to maintain the grave.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} that Blaufränkisch or a similar forerunner of the grape was already cultivated in regions of present Austria (<b>Lower</b> <b>Austria</b> and Burgenland) in the 10th century. In his 1777 publication Beschreibung der in der Wiener Gegend gemeinen Weintrauben-Arten, ampelographer Sebastian Helbling accounted the variety {{as one of the}} best red grape varieties of <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria,</b> and used the name Schwarze Fränkische for it.|$|E

5000|$|Then the [...] "Miracle of Lassing" [...] occurred. The first miner to be buried, Georg Hainzl, {{was rescued}} after ten days {{and was found}} in {{surprisingly}} good health. His rescue was achieved by a German company that had previously worked with OMV and had a suitable drill rig available that, unlike the OMV equipment, was suitable for large diameters and rather shallow depths. With the help of logistics and other departments of the OMV the hole was drilled. The decompression chamber specially made to measure by the OMV was not needed, as no overpressure existed in the survival chamber in which Georg Hainzl found himself, something {{that could only be}} ascertained after the drilling. The man who subsequently became <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria's</b> fire chief, Josef Buchta, was heavily involved in the construction of this decompression chamber.|$|R

50|$|At {{the summit}} of the Gallitzinberg is an {{observation}} tower which in 1956 replaced an older steel construction that had been erected in 1899 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of emperor Franz Joseph I's ascendancy to the Austrian throne. Therefore, the present tower is still colloquially known as the Jubiläumswarte (“jubilee tower”). Its topmost platform, 31 meters above ground, offers an impressive panorama of Vienna. On very clear days one can see for more than 60 kilometers, to the Slovak Little Carpathians beyond the city in the East, and to the Schneeberg, <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria's</b> highest mountain, in the South. Next to the tower it is a small facility dedicated to the education of Vienna's schoolchildren in the fundamentals of forest biology. Also in the immediate vicinity, but with few remains visible above ground, is the legacy of the Gaugefechtsstand Wien, a Wehrmacht command and control bunker which during the later years of World War II coordinated air alarms and aerial defense for Vienna and its surroundings.|$|R

40|$|Loam {{construction}} has an old tradition – in many ancient cultures impressive examples of loam architecture were built; {{some of them}} still exist today. It {{is only in the}} recent past – approx. since World War II – that loam {{construction has}} been driven out of the industrial building sector. Today it is only very seldom used in Europe as a niche product in the handicraft sector. The old building material loam, its ecological and healthy properties, especially the improved living quality, is re-discovered by many architects and house builders, the demand is increasing steadily. Unfortunately there are no industrial building systems for loam construction available on the market at the moment. The market is restricted to some small providers of loam products, primarily loam plaster. WIENERBERGER AG, the world market leader in bricks, has now reacted to this development and has initiated a research project together with <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria’s</b> Green Building Cluster and other partners from industry, science and building practice, which has the target to develop an industrial building system on the basis of unfired clay blocks to reach a highest possible level of sustainability...|$|R

The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in Moravia, <b>Lower</b> <b>Austria,</b> Silesia, and Styria. As these territories were all held in feudal tenure from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the Habsburgs, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement {{to qualify for a}} seat in the Imperial diet (parliament), the Reichstag. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
