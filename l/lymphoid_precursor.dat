Broadly speaking, the double negative (DN) stage is focused on producing a functional β-chain whereas the double positive (DP) stage is focused on producing a functional α-chain, ultimately producing a functional αβ T cell receptor. As the developing thymocyte progresses through the four DN stages (DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4), the T cell expresses an invariant α-chain but rearranges the β-chain locus. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele) and result in proliferation of the cell. Although these signals require this pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. These thymocytes will then express both CD4 and CD8 and progresses to the double positive (DP) stage where selection of the α-chain takes place. If a rearranged β-chain {{does not lead to}} any signalling (e.g. {{as a result of an}} inability to pair with the invariant α-chain), the cell may die by neglect (lack of signalling).|$|E

40|$|The widely {{accepted}} model of IL- 7 {{is that of}} a mitotic stimulus mediating the expansion of bone marrow B cell precursors prior to antigen receptor mediated selection and exit to the periphery. Studies utilizing mice deficient in IL- 7 signaling reinforced this model and proposed that IL- 7 may mediate B cell commitment as well. The focus of these investigations centered on mid- to late-stream B cell progenitors in the bone marrow, but I have established that IL- 7 is critical for the generation of the earliest known B cell precursors and that IL- 7 is unique in its ability to promote early B-lineage differentiation from multipotent, <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors.</b> These data lead to a revised model of the role of IL- 7 in early, B-lineage events and have forced a re-evaluation of previous data. ^ There is a significant amount of data indicating that the primary lesion in the aged marrow occurs in mid- to late-stream B cell precursors and is in part caused by dysregulated IL- 7. Given that I had shown that the earliest stages of B cell production are critically dependant on IL- 7, I sought to characterize the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> in aged marrow. I have demonstrated that age impacts the earliest known <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> and that there are cell-intrinsic defects localized to aged HSCs hampering their lymphoid potential.

50|$|The JAK2 gene encodes {{a member}} of the Janus kinase family of non-receptor {{tyrosine}} kinase, JAK2. The JAK2 protein associates with the cytoplasmic tails of various cytokine and growth factor receptors that reside on the cell surface and reagulate Haematopoiesis, i.e. the development and growth of blood cells. Examples of such receptors include the erythropoietin receptor, Thrombopoietin receptor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, Interleukin-3 receptor, Interleukin-5 receptor, Interleukin-6 receptor, and the receptor Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which is a complex composed of the CRLF2 receptor combined with alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor. JAK2 protein's association with these receptors is responsible for a) correctly targeting and positioning these receptors at the cell surface and b) indirectly activating critical cell signaling pathways including in particular the STAT family of transcription factors which are involved in promoting the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the myeloid and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> cells that populate the bone marrow, other blood cell forming tissues, and the blood. The PCM1 gene codes for the PCM1 protein, i.e. pricentriolar material 1. also known as PCM1, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the PCM1 gene. The PCM1 protein exhibits a distinct cell cycle-dependent association with the centrosome complex and microtubules; it is critical for the normal cell cycle and cell division (see PCM1).|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of immunophenotypic markers with restricted expression {{has long been}} a critical issue in diagnostic and therapeutic advances for acute leukemias. We previously developed a monoclonal antibody against a new thymocyte surface antigen, JL 1, and showed that JL 1 is expressed in the majority of acute leukemia cases. In this study, using multiparameter flow cytometric analyses, we found that JL 1 was uniquely expressed in subpopulations of normal bone marrow (BM) cells, implying the association of JL 1 with the differentiation and maturation process. Although CD 34 + CD 10 + <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> and some of maturing myeloid cells express JL 1, neither CD 34 + CD 38 −/lo nor CD 34 + AC 133 + noncommitted pluripotent stem cells do. As for the myeloid precursors, CD 34 + CD 33 + cells do not express JL 1. During lymphopoiesis, JL 1 on the earliest <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> disappear in the CD 20 + sIgM+ stage of B-cell development or after CD 1 a down-regulation in thymocytes. Despite the highly restricted expression of JL 1 in normal BM cells, most of the leukemias express JL 1 irrespective of their immunophenotypes. These results indicate that JL 1 is not only a novel differentiation antigen of hematopoietic cells, but also a leukemia-associated antigen. Therefore, we suggest that JL 1 be a candidate molecule in acute leukemia for the diagnosis and immunotherapy that spares the normal BM stem cells...|$|R
50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} give rise to: 1) myeloid {{precursor}} cells that differentiate into red blood cells, mast cells, blood platelet-forming megakaryocytes, or myeloblasts, which latter cells subsequently differentiate into {{white blood cells}} viz., neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and eosinophils; or 2) <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> cells which differentiate into T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. Malignant transformation of these stem or precursor cells results {{in the development of}} various hematological malignancies. Some of these transformations involve chromosomal translocations or Interstitial deletions that create fusion genes. These fusion genes encode fusion proteins that continuously stimulate cell growth, proliferation, prolonged survival, and/or differentiation. Such mutations occur in hematological stem cells and/or their daughter myeloid precursor and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> cells; commonly involve genes that encode tyrosine kinase proteins; and cause or {{contribute to the development of}} hematological malignancies. A classic example of such a disease is chronic myelogenous leukemia, a neoplasm commonly caused by a mutation that creates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (see Philadelphia chromosome). The disease is due to conversion of the tightly regulated tyrosine kinase of ABL1 protein to being unregulated and continuously active in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia I now successfully treated with maintenance tyrosine kinase inhibitors but before this at the time novel therapeutic approach was generally lethal within 18-60 months of diagnosis. Some hematological malignancies exhibit increased numbers of circulating blood eosinophils, increased numbers of bone marrow eosinophils, and/or eosinophil infiltrations into otherwise normal tissues. These malignancies were at first diagnosed as eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia, acute eosinophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, other myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloid sarcoma, lymphoid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on their association with eosinophils, unique genetic mutations, and known or potential sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other specific drug therapies, they are now in the process of being classified together as clonal hypereosinophilia. Historically, patients suffering the cited eosinophil-related syndromes were evaluated for causes of their eosinophilia such as those due to allergic disease, parasite or fungal infection, autoimmune disorders, and various well-known hematological malignancies (e.g. Chronic myelogenous leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, etc.) (see causes of eosinophilia). Absent these causes, patients were diagnosed in the World Health Organization's classification as having either 1) Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified, (CEL-NOS) if blood or bone marrow blast cells exceeded 2% or 5% of total nucleated cells, respectively, and other criteria were met or 2) idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) if there was evidence of eosinophil-induced tissue damage but no criteria indicating chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Discovery of genetic mutations underlining these eosinophilia syndromes lead to their removal from CEL-NOS or HES categories and classification as myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Informally, these diseases are also termed clonal hypereosinophilias. New genetic mutations associated with, and possibly contributing to the development of, eosinophilia have been discovered, deemed to be causes of clonal eosinophilia, and, in certain cases, recommended for inclusion in the category of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Many of the genetic causes for clonal eosinophilia are rare but nonetheless merit attention because of their known or potential sensitivity to therapeutic interventions that differ dramatically form the often toxic chemotherapy used to treat more common hematological malignancies.|$|E

Mature B-lineage leukemias and acute nonlymphocytic leukemias retained the T-cell receptor delta gene in the germline configuration. The incidence of T cell receptor gamma and delta was particularly high in CD 10 +CD 19 + non-T, non-B <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> ALL. In <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> ALL, T cell receptor delta was frequently rearranged while T cell receptor gamma was in the germline configuration.

Several distinct rearrangements were defined using a panel of restriction enzymes. Most of the rearrangements observed in T-ALL represented joining events of J delta 1 to upstream regions. In contrast, the majority of rearrangements in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> ALL most likely represented D-D or V-D rearrangements, which {{have been found to}} be early recombinatorial events of the TCR delta locus.

Using novel rat mAbs directed against the extracellular domains of Notch 1 and Notch 2, we find that Notch 1 is already highly expressed on common <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> in the bone marrow and remains at high levels during intrathymic maturation of CD 4 (-) CD 8 (-) thymocytes. Notch 1 is progressively down-regulated at the CD 4 (+) CD 8 (+) and mature CD 4 (+) or CD 8 (+) thymic stages and is expressed at low levels on peripheral T cells. Immunofluorescence staining of thymus cryosections further revealed a localization of Notch 1 (+) CD 25 (-) cells adjacent to the thymus capsule. Notch 1 was up-regulated on peripheral T cells following activation in vitro with anti-CD 3 mAbs or infection in vivo with lymphocytic chorio-meningitis virus or Leishmania major. In contrast to Notch 1, Notch 2 was expressed at intermediate levels on common <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> and CD 117 (+) early intrathymic subsets, but disappeared completely at subsequent stages of T cell development. However, transient up-regulation of Notch 2 was also observed on peripheral T cells following anti-CD 3 stimulation.

The results indicate that in me/me and mev/mev mice prothymocytes in bone marrow are present in essentially normal numbers, as determined by intrathymic injection, but apparently lack the ability to home effectively to the thymus, as determined by intravenous transfer; early B lineage cells in bone marrow, identified by the B 220 antigen, are markedly depleted, including immature B cells (sIg+), pre-B cells (cIg+, sIg-), and pro-B cells (B 220 +, cIg-, sIg-); TdT+ bone marrow cells, especially a subset that expresses the B 220 B lineage antigen, are markedly depleted by two weeks of age; normal numbers of TdT+ thymocytes are present during the first 3 wk of postnatal life, but rapidly decrease thereafter. The results further indicate that neither the defective thymus homing capacity of prothymocytes nor the deficiency of TdT+ bone marrow cells is due to autoantibodies.

E 11 is suggested to be a critical stage of B-lymphocytegenesis in the bursa of chick embryos. ファブリシウス嚢はＢリンパ球分化と増殖のための中枢リンパ組織として鳥類の免疫機能の発達において重要な役割を演じている．培養ファブリシウス嚢上皮細胞は胚のファブリシウス嚢リンパ球に膜の IgM 分子（sIgM）の発 現を誘導する因子を産生することが報告されている．ファブリシウス嚢リンパ球の sIgM 発現誘導因子に対する感受性はファブリシウス嚢における分化の時期において変動する可能性が考えられる．ニワトリの胚では，リンパ球系の前駆細胞は胚発達の７日目から 14 日目の間においてのみファブリシウス嚢に進入・定着することが知られている．そこで本研究では，リンパ球系前駆細胞がファブリシウス嚢に定着するこの時期（ 10 日胚から 13 日胚）におけるファブリシウス嚢リンパ球の sIgM 発現の変動を調べるとともに，これらの細胞における sIgM 発現誘導因子に対する感受性の変動について測定した．sIgM 陽性細胞の割合は 11 日胚で有意に上昇した．sIgM 発現誘導因子に対する反応性はこの時期の胚発達に伴って変動し， 11 日胚で高い傾向を示した．これらの結果から， 11 日胚齢はニワトリ胚のファブリシウス嚢におけるＢリンパ球の発達に関して重要な時期であることが示唆された...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{induce a}} signal {{transmitted}} by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which suppresses illegitimate joining of DSBs and activates cell-cycle checkpoints. Here {{we show that}} a significant fraction of mature ATM-deficient lymphocytes contain telomere-deleted ends produced by failed end joining during V(D) J recombination. These RAG- 1 / 2 endonuclease-dependent, terminally deleted chromosomes persist in peripheral lymphocytes for at least 2 weeks in vivo and are stable over several generations in vitro. Restoration of ATM kinase activity in mature lymphocytes that have transiently lost ATM function leads to loss of cells with terminally deleted chromosomes. Thus, maintenance of genomic stability in lymphocytes requires faithful end joining as well a checkpoint that prevents the long-term persistence and transmission of DSBs. Silencing this checkpoint permits DNA ends produced by V(D) J recombination in a <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursor</b> to serve as substrates for translocations with chromosomes subsequently damaged by other means in mature cells...|$|E

Hence, there is aberrant expression of miRNAs involved in malignant lymphopoiesis, and these aberrations can be used as signatures of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with different subtypes. In addition, changes in the expression of several miRNAs may have functional relevance with leukemogenesis or drug resistance. As a result, the reversal of the expression of these miRNAs may alleviate the disease to some extent and improve clinical outcomes. However, among the studies of miRNAs, there are still some problems that need to be solved to understand the function of miRNAs in ALL more thoroughly.

40|$|How {{the vast}} {{majority}} of B cells express only one of the two alleles at their immunoglobulin loci remains a biological puzzle. Here, in mice reconstituted with a single haematopoietic stem cell, we demonstrate that each of the two immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) alleles has a similar probability {{to be the first to}} undergo V(H) to DJ(H) rearrangement. We also observe this similar probability in clones from multipotent and common <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors.</b> The extreme biases in the expression of the alleles that we find in more differentiated subsets are mostly due to constraints imposed by early rearrangements. Our data demonstrate that each of the two Igh alleles in a B cell behaves independently of the other, up to the moment when a successful rearrangement in one allele triggers a feedback mechanism that prevents further recombination.

40|$|SummaryCanonical Wnt {{signaling}} {{has been}} implicated in the regulation of hematopoiesis. By employing a Wnt-reporter mouse, we observed that Wnt signaling is differentially activated during hematopoiesis, suggesting an important regulatory role for specific Wnt signaling levels. To investigate whether canonical Wnt signaling regulates hematopoiesis in a dosage-dependent fashion, we analyzed the effect of different mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc), a negative modulator of the canonical Wnt pathway. By combining different targeted hypomorphic alleles and a conditional deletion allele of Apc, a gradient of five different Wnt signaling levels was obtained in vivo. We here show that different, lineage-specific Wnt dosages regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid <b>precursors,</b> and T <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors</b> during hematopoiesis. Differential, lineage-specific optimal Wnt dosages provide a unifying concept that explains the differences reported among inducible gain-of-function approaches, leading to either HSC expansion or depletion of the HSC pool...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 7 (IL- 7) {{promotes}} {{survival and}} expansion of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>precursors.</b> We show here that, in addition, IL- 7 has a fundamental role, {{as early as the}} stage of the multipotent (B/T/NK) common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), in maintaining the B cell differentiation program open. CLPs generated in the absence of IL- 7 have normal T/NK differentiation potential, but severely impaired B potential. Accordingly, CLPs from IL- 7 –deficient mice express lower amounts of early B cell factor (EBF) and Pax 5 than wild-type CLPs, but similar amounts of GATA- 3. Importantly, induced overexpression of EBF is sufficient to restore the B potential in these cells. These results indicate that IL- 7 directs commitment of CLPs by modulating EBF expression. This is the first example of a cytokine influencing lymphoid lineage commitment in multipotent progenitors and highlights the relevance of the expression of a functional IL- 7 receptor at the CLP stage...|$|R
