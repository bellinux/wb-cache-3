5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and <b>landing</b> <b>of</b> Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas.
