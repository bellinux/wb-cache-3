40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interface between}} fine-grained and coarse-grained programmable logic in FPGAs. Specifically, it presents an empirical study that covers the <b>location,</b> <b>pin</b> arrangement, and interconnect between embedded floating point units (FPUs) and the fine-grained logic fabric in FPGAs. It also studies this interface in FPGAs which contain both FPUs and embedded memories. The results show that (1) FPUs should have a square aspect ratio; (2) they should be positioned {{near the center of}} the FPGA; (3) their I/O pins should be arranged around all four sides of the FPU; (4) embedded memory should be located between the FPUs; and (5) connecting higher I/O density coarse-grained blocks increases the demand for routing resources. The hybrid FPGAs with embedded memory required 12 % wider channels than the case where embedded memory is not used. Copyright © 2008 Chi Wai Yu et al.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{existing}} state-of-the-art of turbine blade manufacture highlights two operations {{that have not been}} automated namely that of loading of a turbine blade into an encapsulation die, and that of removing a machined blade from the encapsulation block. The automation of blade decapsulation has not been pursued. In order to develop a system to automate the loading of an encapsulation die a prototype mechanical handling robot has been designed together with a computer controlled encapsulation die. The robot has been designed as a mechanical handling robot of cylindrical geometry, suitable for use in a circular work cell. It is the prototype for a production model to be called `The Cybermate'. The prototype robot is mechanically complete but due to unforeseen circumstances the robot control system is not available (the development of the control system did not form a part of this project), hence it has not been possible to fully test and assess the robot mechanical design. Robot loading of the encapsulation die has thus been simulated. The research work with regard to the encapsulation die has focused on the development of computer controlled, hydraulically actuated, location pins. Such pins compensate for the inherent positional inaccuracy of the loading robot and reproduce the dexterity of the human operator. Each pin comprises a miniature hydraulic cylinder, controlled by a standard bidirectional flow control valve. The precision positional control is obtained through pulsing of the valves under software control, with positional feedback from an 8 -bit transducer. A test-rig comprising one hydraulic <b>location</b> <b>pin</b> together with an opposing spring loaded pin has demonstrated that such a pin arrangement can be controlled with a repeatability of +/-. 00045 '. In addition this test-rig has demonstrated that such a pin arrangement can be used to gauge and compensate for the dimensional error of the component held between the pins, by offsetting the pin datum positions to allow for the component error. A gauging repeatability of +/- 0. 00015 ' was demonstrated. This work has led to the design and manufacture of an encapsulation die comprising ten such pins and the associated computer software. All aspects of the control software except blade gauging and positional data storage have been demonstrated. Work is now required to achieve the accuracy of control demonstrated by the single pin test-rig, with each of the ten pins in the encapsulation die. This would allow trials of the complete loading cycle to take place...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{hierarchical}} technique for floorplanning and pin assignment {{of the general}} cell layouts. Given a set of cells with their shape lists, a layout aspect ratio, relative positions of the extemal 110 pads and upper bound delay constraints {{for a set of}} critical nets, we determine shapes and positions of the cells, locations of the floating pins on cells and a global routing solution such that a linear combination of the layout area, the total interconnection length and constraint violations for critical nets is minimized. Floorplanning, pin assignment and global routing influence one another during the hierarchical steps of the algorithm. The pin assignment algorithm is flexible and allows various user specified constraints such as pre-specified <b>pin</b> <b>locations,</b> feedthrough <b>pins,</b> length-critical nets and planar net topologies.

50|$|For multi-row pin headers, the {{pin number}} is more complex, because knowing the <b>location</b> of <b>pin</b> 1 doesn't {{automatically}} ensure how the remaining pins are numbered. Typically for headers attached to ribbon cables, the pins are numbered {{so they go}} linearly across the cable.

40|$|We present two test-data {{delivery}} optimization algorithms for system-on-chip (SOC) designs {{with hundreds}} of cores, where a network-on-chip (NOC) is used as the interconnection fabric. We first present an e ective algorithm based on a subsetsum formulation to solve the test-delivery problem in NOCs with arbitrary topology that use dedicated routing. We further propose an algorithm for the important class of NOCs with grid topology and XY routing. The proposed algorithm {{is the first to}} co-optimize the number of access points, access-point <b>locations,</b> <b>pin</b> distribution to access points, and assignment of cores to access points for optimal test resource utilization of such NOCs. Testtime minimization is modeled as an NOC partitioning problem and solved with dynamic programming in polynomial time. Both the proposed methods yield high-quality results and are scalable to large SOCs with many cores. We present results on synthetic grid topology NOC-based SOCs constructed using cores from the ITC’ 02 benchmark, and demonstrate the scalability of our approach for two SOCs of the future, one with nearly 1, 000 cores and the other with 1, 600 cores. Test scheduling under power constraints is also incorporated in the optimization framework...|$|R

40|$|Using {{convergence}} {{tape for}} measuring rock movement in a tunnel during construction {{to control the}} stability of the excavation is a common practice. In this technique a number of reference points (convergence pins) are installed around the tunnel periphery. After each face advance, the distance between pairs of pins is measured by 0. 01 mm accuracy. Stability of the tunnel can then be evaluated according to the recorded deformations. Usually in this method, the exact <b>locations</b> of <b>pins</b> after deformations are not determined and just changes in length are measured. In this paper, methods of calculating exact coordinates of pins are presented by using convergence tape as the main instrument and leveling tools and single point extensometers as complementary. Recommendations are also made to optimize the installation <b>location</b> of the <b>pins</b> to maximize obtained information from the readings and ease of interpretations. In {{the second part of the}} paper, error sources in Sakurai’s formula for back analysis of tunnel deformation is detected and eliminated by using the offered generalized formula. 1...|$|R

40|$|Slots in {{metallic}} ground {{planes are}} very promising candidates for conformal antenna applications. However, a low-profile unidirectional antenna requires a back reflector {{close to the}} slot and the resulting stripline feed causes strong excitation of parallel-plate modes. In this contribution, we consider unidirectional reflector-backed slot configurations with parallel-plate mode suppression by shorting pins. Starting from a parametric study with respect to shorting <b>pin</b> <b>location</b> and back reflector distance, we present a stripline-fed rectangular slot element with radiation efficiency of more than 80 % and a bandwidth of about 5 % at centre frequency 10 GHz. A careful optimisation of shorting <b>pin</b> <b>locations</b> guarantees reliable parallel-plate mode suppression without deteriorating the slot radiation behaviour. Coupling coefficients between parallel and aligned rectangular slot elements are presented. For increased bandwidth applications, a bow-tie slot element with about 8 % bandwidth and radiation efficiency of close to 80 % is proposed...|$|R

After an event or trip, Photos will group the best photos together and suggest creating an album with them, alongside maps to show geographic travel and <b>location</b> <b>pins</b> for exact places. Users can also add text captions to describe photos. In October, Google announced multiple significant updates; Google Photos will now surface old memories with people identified in users' recent photos; it will occasionally highlight the best photos when a user has recently {{taken a lot}} of images of a specific subject; it will now make animations from videos as well as photos (photo animations have been present since the start), displaying the most memorable moments in videos; and it will now find all sideways photos and help the user easily flip them to normal orientation. For all of these features, Google touts machine learning does the work, with no user interaction required. In November, Google released a separate app - PhotoScan - for users to scan printed photos into the service. The app, released for iOS and Android, uses a scanning process in which users must center their camera over four dots that overlay the printed image, so that the software can combine the photographs for a high resolution digital image with fewest possible defects. Later that month, Google added a [...] "Deep blue" [...] slider feature that lets users change the color and saturation of skies, without degrading image quality or inadvertently changing colors of other objects or elements in photos.|$|R
