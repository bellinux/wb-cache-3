This study used various real-time aerosol detectors to investigate the presence of nanoaerosols in a laboratory used to manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO 2). The TiO 2 nanopowders were produced via flame synthesis and collected by a bag filter system for subsequent harvesting. Highly concentrated nanopowders were released from the outlet of the bag filter system into the laboratory. The fractional particle collection efficiency of the bag filter system was only 20 % at particle diameter of 100 [*]nm, which is much lower than the performance of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Furthermore, the <b>laboratory</b> <b>hood</b> system was inadequate to fully exhaust the air discharged from the bag filter system.

5000|$|Fume hoods, {{also known}} as <b>laboratory</b> {{chemical}} <b>hoods,</b> {{are one of the}} most important and widely used engineering controls to protect workers in <b>laboratories.</b> Fume <b>hoods</b> were introduced about 100 years ago to safeguard personnel working with hazardous materials. While many changes and improvements have been made, the basic concept and design of fume hoods remains the same. Air is drawn from the workplace, around the worker and into the front of the hood, and is then exhausted out of the <b>laboratory.</b> Most <b>laboratory</b> <b>hoods</b> are described as constant air volume (CAV) hoods because they draw a constant amount of air at all times. Rising energy costs have made these hoods exceptionally expensive to operate. For example, a single six-foot hood operating 24/7/365 costs over $5,000/year to operate. [...] In addition, CAV hoods do not react rapidly to airflow disturbances (turbulence) within the hood or within the laboratory and, hence, their sole purpose of containment and protection can be seriously compromised.|$|R

40|$|The ANSI/ASHRAE 110 Method is the {{standard}} test for <b>laboratory</b> <b>hood</b> containment performance. Sulfur hexafluoride is specified as the gas most suitable for this test and is most commonly used. Sulfur hexafluoride use has potential negative environmental repercussions {{as it is a}} potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 22, 800 times greater per mass than CO₂. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate nitrous oxide, a much less environmentally destructive tracer gas, as a potential substitute in the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 Method. In accordance with ANSI standards, flow visualization, face velocity, and tracer gas tests were performed on numerous laboratory hoods of varying design. A mannequin was positioned in front of the center of the hood, and a MIRAN SapphlRe was used to measure the presence of each tracer gas. Direct comparisons of the concentrations of the two gases were dominated by a few high concentrations. For this reason, concentrations of both gases were log 1 O-transformed for statistical analyses. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>hood</b> dimensions and properties were found to affect the relationship between the gases. The hood area of opening and sash height were found to significantly (p< 0. 001) affect logjo(SF₆/ N₂O). Average face velocity also significantly (p< 0. 025) affected the log ratio. Neither gas was an adequate indicator of the behavior of the other. The linear best fit of the logs of the concentration ratio had a slope of 0. 858, a y-intercept of 0. 434, and an R² of 35. 9 % indicating a poor correlation. For N₂O to qualify as a substitute for SF 6 there would need to be a strong correlation between gas concentrations that was consistent independently of hood conditions. This condition was not met. Nitrous oxide was found to not be a suitable substitute for sulfur hexafluoride in the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 Method. by Eric J. Guffey. Thesis (S. B.)

Considering {{the large numbers of}} personnel, especially in petrochemical industry laboratories, this project was carried out in order to assess the performance of <b>laboratory</b> <b>hoods</b> based on tracer gas (SF 6). Materials and Methods: In this project 22 <b>hoods</b> in the <b>laboratories</b> of a petrochemical industry were studied. Operation of the hoods was assessed based on quantitative (with SF 6 as tracer gas) and qualitative (face velocity measurement, using thermal anemometer) tests, according to ASHRAE 110 stndard. Results: In comparison with the minimum acceptable face velocity (80 fpm), the mean values of face velocities of only 9. 09 % of the hoods passed the test (P= 0. 001) and were at an acceptable level. As regards the tracer gas test, the results were even worse: only 4. 5 % of the hoods passed the acceptability test (p= 0. 001). In addition, non of the hoods having an acceptable face velocity passed the tracer gas test. Similarly, no hood with an accepatable tracer gas performance had an acceptable face velocity.

40|$|A `user {{tracer gas}} test` was {{performed}} on <b>laboratory</b> <b>hoods,</b> with a human subject {{standing in front of}} the hood, to assess hood containment ability. The relationship of face velocity and cross draft variables to hood containment ability is investigated. The ability of these variables and other tests, such as smoke challenges or tracer gas tests performed with a manikin at the hood, to predict the results of the user tracer gas test is evaluated. All of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>hoods</b> tested in this study were identical bench top bypass hoods with horizontally sliding sashes. A face velocity traverse, cross draft measurements, a pitot traverse to measure exhaust flow, a smoke test, a manikin tracer gas test, and a user tracer gas test were performed on each hood in several different sash positions. Based on the data collected, face velocity, its distribution and variability, and the magnitude of cross drafts relative to face velocity are important variables in determining hood leakage. `Unblocked` vortices, formed such that no physical barrier exists between the vortex and room air or a person in front of the hood, are identified as important sites of leakage. For the hoods evaluated in this study, unblocked vortices were observed along the beveled side edges. The data support the hypothesis that in the presence of a person {{standing in front of the}} hood, leakage is more likely to occur if unblocked vortices are formed than if all vortices are blocked. Evidence suggests that cross drafts are more likely to cause leakage when flowing in a direction that may cause separated flow along a beveled edge of the hood and thereby augment the unblocked vortices along the edge. Results indicate that smoke tests, manikin tracer gas tests, and average face velocity all serve as useful monitoring techniques.

40|$|Emission {{from field}} burning of crop residue, a common {{practice}} {{in many parts of}} the world today, has potential effects on air quality, atmosphere and climate. This study provides a comprehensive size and compositional characterization of particulate matter (PM) emission from rice straw (RS) burning using both in situ experiments (11 spread field burning) and <b>laboratory</b> <b>hood</b> experiments (3 pile and 6 spread burning) that were conducted during 2003 - 2006 in Thailand. The carbon balance and emission ratio method was used to determine PM emission factors (EF) in the field experiments. The obtained EFs varied from field to hood experiments reflecting multiple factors affecting combustion and emission. In the hood experiments, EFs were found to be depending on the burning types (spread or pile), moisture content and the combustion efficiency. In addition, in the field experiments, burning rate and EF were also influenced by weather conditions, i. e. wind. Hood pile burning produced significantly higher EF (20 +/- 8 g kg(- 1) RS) than hood spread burning (4. 7 +/- 2. 2 g kg(- 1) RS). The majority of PM emitted from the field burning was PM(2. 5) with EF of 5. 1 +/- 0. 7 g m(- 2) or 8. 3 +/- 2. 7 g kg(- 1) RS burned. The coarse PM fraction (PM(10 - 2. 5)) was mainly generated by fire attention activities and was relatively small, hence the resulting EF of PM(10) (9. 4 +/- 3. 5 g kg(- 1) RS) was not significantly higher than PM(2. 5). PM size distribution was measured across 8 size ranges (from 9. 0 mum). The largest fractions of PM, EC and OC were associated with PM(1. 1). The most significant components in PM(2. 5) and PM(10) include OC, water soluble ions and levoglucosan. Relative abundance of some methoxyphenols (e. g., acetylsyringone), PAHs (e. g., fluoranthene and pyrene), organochlorine pesticides and PCBs may also serve as additional signatures for the PM emission. Presence of these toxic compounds in PM of burning smoke increases the potential toxic effects of the emission. For illustration, estimation of the annual RS field burning in Thailand was made using the obtained in situ field burning EFs and preliminary burning activity dat...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} the L-Basin Corrosion Surveillance Program for the fiscal year 2004. Test coupons were removed from the basin on February 12, 2004, shipped to Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and visually examined in a contaminated <b>laboratory</b> <b>hood.</b> Selected coupons were metallurgically characterized to establish the extent of general corrosion and pitting. Pitting was observed on galvanically coupled and on intentionally creviced coupons, thus demonstrating that localized concentration cells were formed during the exposure period. In these cases, the susceptibility to pitting was not attributed to aggressive basin water chemistry but to localized conditions (intentional crevices and galvanic coupling) that allowed the development of oxygen and/or metal ion concentration cells that produced locally aggressive waters. General oxidation was also observed on all of the coupons with localized corrosion observed on some of the coupons. These coupons were not pretreated to produce a protective oxide layer prior to exposure in the basin water. Non-protected coupons are more susceptible to corrosion than fuel cladding which has developed a protective oxide layer from high temperature reactor operations. However, the oxide on spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in L-Basin is not necessarily in pristine condition. Some of the oxide may have spalled off or been mechanically damaged prior to arrival at SRS. These areas on the fuel cladding would have the same susceptibility to corrosion as the coupons. Current observations from the test coupons demonstrate that, even with rigorously controlled basin water chemistry, localized aggressive conditions can develop in intentional crevice and galvanic samples. These results do illustrate the potential for corrosion induced degradation and thus the importance of a routine surveillance program similar to that conducted on the Uruguay fuel and on the surveillance coupons stored in L-Basin and future in-service inspections proposed for additional SNF in L-Basin. The 2004 results are compared to previous results on coupons removed from SRS basins in fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The extent of corrosion is correlated with sample and storage conditions as well as the water chemistry during the storage period. Coupon weight gains from 2004 coupons are similar to those from 2003. Oxides were removed from furniture rack coupons from 2003 and 2004 and comparable pit depths were found in the filler metal. Corrosion induced-degradation of the spent nuclear fuels stored in L-Basin could potentially impact the storage process by causing cladding penetration, exposing fuel core material, and allowing release of radionuclides to the basin waters. Such releases could potentially lead to high water activity levels which could impact fuel integrity and present problems in future fuel handling and transfer operations. However, the collective results (to date) of the coupon and water chemistry evaluations and Uruguay spent fuel inspections indicate that the fuel in the SRS storage basins has not experienced corrosion-induced degradation that will limit the time for interim storage in the basin waters. Continued surveillance and inspection is essential due to the potential for corrosion induced degradation. The next withdrawal of surveillance coupons from L-Basin occurred on March 29, 2005...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} support the air {{emissions}} permit for the 3410 Building, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory performed {{a series of tests}} in the exhaust air discharge from the reconfigured 3410 Building Filtered Exhaust Stack. The objective was to determine whether the location of the air sampling probe for emissions monitoring meets the applicable regulatory criteria governing such effluent monitoring systems. In particular, the capability of the air sampling probe location to meet the acceptance criteria of ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities was determined. The qualification criteria for these types of stacks address 1) uniformity of air velocity, 2) sufficiently small flow angle with respect to the axis of the duct, 3) uniformity of tracer gas concentration, and 4) uniformity of tracer particle concentration. Testing was performed to conform to the quality requirements of NQA- 1 - 2000. Fan configurations tested included all fan combinations of any two fans at a time. Most of the tests were conducted at the normal flow rate, while a small subset of tests was performed at a slightly higher flow rate achieved with the <b>laboratory</b> <b>hood</b> sashes fully open. The qualification criteria for an air monitoring probe location are taken from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 and are paraphrased as follows with key results summarized: 1. Angular Flow—The average air velocity angle must not deviate from the axis of the stack or duct by more than 20 °. Our test results show that the mean angular flow angles at the center two-thirds of the ducts are smaller than 4. 5  for all testing conditions. 2. Uniform Air Velocity—The acceptance criterion is that the COV of the air velocity must be ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the area of the stack. Our results show that the COVs of the air velocity across the center two-thirds of the stack are smaller than 2. 9 % for all testing conditions. 3. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Gases—The uniformity of the concentration of potential contaminants is first tested using a tracer gas to represent gaseous effluents. The tracer is injected downstream of the fan outlets and at the junction downstream fan discharges meet. The acceptance criteria are that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane and 2) at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by > 30 %. Our test results show that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is 6. 5 %. 4. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Particles—Tracer particles of 10 -μm aerodynamic diameter are used for the second demonstration of concentration uniformity. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of particle concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the sampling plane. Our test results indicate that the COV of particle concentration is < 9. 9 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane among all testing conditions. Thus, the reconfigured 3410 Building Filtered Exhaust Stack was determined to meet the qualification criteria given in the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 standard.

Among the 43 quantitative experimental studies, 21 comparable studies were selected, and then a meta-analysis of the comparable studies was conducted. The exposure concentration variable from the resulting 617 independent test conditions was dichotomized into acceptable or unacceptable using the control level of 0. 1 ppm tracer gas. Regression analysis using Cox proportional hazards models provided hood failure ratios for potential exposure determinants. The variables that were found to be statistically significant were the presence of a mannequin/human subject, the distance between a source and breathing zone, and the height of sash opening. In summary, performance of <b>laboratory</b> fume <b>hoods</b> was affected mainly by the presence of a mannequin/human subject, distance between a source and breathing zone, and height of sash opening. Presence of a mannequin/human subject in front of the hood adversely affects hood performance. Worker exposures to air contaminants can be greatly reduced by increasing the distance between the contaminant source and breathing zone and by reducing the height of sash opening. Many other factors can also affect hood performance. Checking face velocity by itself is unlikely to be sufficient in evaluating hood performance properly. An evaluation of the performance of a <b>laboratory</b> fume <b>hood</b> should be performed with a human subject or a mannequin in front of the hood and should address the effects of the activities performed by a hood user...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction <b>Laboratory</b> fume <b>hoods</b> are {{mechanical}} devices used {{to extract}} harmful vapours from indoor workplaces {{in order to}} prevent human exposure thereto. <b>Laboratory</b> fume <b>hoods</b> are considered an engineering control in the hierarchy of control and are ubiquitous in the modern laboratory. Protection offered by the fume hood depends on whether it is performing according to its original design. This performance needs to be maintained {{for as long as the}} fume hood is in use. Gaining a better understanding of this performance and the limitations of the fume hood are essential in ensuring constant operator protection. No performance or measurement standard to which fume hoods need to comply exists in South Africa. The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act no. 85 of 1993) requires engineering controls to be evaluated every 24 months. The Act does not stipulate how such evaluations need to be conducted. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) of the South African Police Service has 49 fume hoods installed in its facility in Silverton, Pretoria. The FSL set a performance standard for its fume hoods at 0. 51 m. s- 1 ± 20...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A prototype perforated backplane air baffle for a <b>laboratory</b> safety <b>hood</b> was designed, fabricated and its performance was evaluated experimentally. Relative to the historically poor performance of slot baffle design, the perforated metal created better laminar flow through the hood, and decreased turbulence in the form of vortices, ultimately resulting in better hood containment. New performance monitoring techniques were developed to aid in future testing of improved <b>laboratory</b> fume <b>hood</b> designs. Three methods were employed to evaluate the hood's performance: 1) face velocity testing, 2) tracer gas containment testing, and 3) smoke containment. Face velocity data was analyzed to evaluate turbulence and consistency across the hood face with the use of new statistical methods described in this thesis. It was determined that turbulence decreased and velocity uniformity increased as the average face velocity increased and as the open area of the hood face decreased. Tracer gas levels outside of the hood, in the operator's breathing zone, were kept below detectable levels (0. 02 ppm) at all face velocity / sash position settings. In this work, a Hood Protection Factor was developed as a quantitative means to compare hood performance. The Hood Protection Factor is a true ratio of the contaminant concentration inside the hood exhaust duct to that in the operator's breathing zone, as both are measured values. A qualitative assessment of the hood's performance was completed by means of smoke testing. Smoke testing showed that smoke was captured / retained without escaping from the hood at all face velocity / sash position settings. Static pressure measurements were taken at the back panel of the hood. Graphical analysis of this data allowed visualization of the uniformity of suction across the perforated air baffle. The prototype backplane air baffle provided reduced turbulence at the hood face, allowing improved containment efficiency. New performance monitoring techniques and statistical evaluation methods were developed so health and safety professionals may better evaluate and design <b>laboratory</b> fume <b>hoods...</b>|$|R

Different VAV hoods change the exhaust volume using different methods, such as a damper or valve in the exhaust duct that opens and closes based on sash position, or a blower that changes speed to meet air-volume demands. Most VAV hoods integrate a modified bypass-block system that ensures adequate airflow at all sash positions. VAV hoods are connected electronically to the laboratory building’s HVAC, so hood exhaust and room supply are balanced. In addition, VAV hoods feature monitors and/or alarms that warn the operator of unsafe hood-airflow conditions.|$|R
