25|$|Depending on {{the color}} of the roasted beans as {{perceived}} by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{measuring}} illumination, the candela is not a practical unit, as it only applies to idealized point light sources, each approximated by a source small compared to the distance from which its luminous radiation is measured, also assuming that it is done so {{in the absence of}} other light sources. What gets directly measured by a <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> is incident light on a sensor of finite area, i.e. illuminance in lm/m2 (lux). However, if designing illumination from many point light sources, like light bulbs, of known approximate omnidirectionally-uniform intensities, the contributions to illuminance from incoherent light being additive, it is mathematically estimated as follows. If ri is the position of the i-th source of uniform intensity Ii, and Ã¢ is the unit vector normal to the illuminated elemental opaque area dA being measured, and provided that all light sources lie in the same half-space divided by the plane of this area, ...|$|E

Work by Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s lead to a systematic combination of lighting and color samples required to quantify colors by human eye. This {{became the basis for}} the Pantone Matching System. Combining this with specialized <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> allowed digital color meters to be invented and popularized.|$|R

50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the amount of light. In photography, a <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> is often used to {{determine}} the proper exposure for a photograph. Typically a <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> will include either digital or analog electronic circuit, which allows the photographer to determine which shutter speed and f-number should be selected for an optimum exposure, given a certain lighting situation and film speed.|$|E

50|$|Compared to single-lens reflex cameras (SLR), mirrorless {{cameras are}} usually simpler, smaller and lighter {{because they do}} not have an optical viewfinder, which is {{composed}} of a mirror housing, a movable mirror, or a viewing prism with reticle. As <b>light</b> <b>metering</b> is done on the image sensor, and autofocus sensed within the sensor plane, mirrorless cameras also don't need a secondary autofocus mirror, nor a separate <b>light</b> <b>metering</b> sensor.|$|R

Descriptive data analysis indicated that both <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> dependably recorded changes in light levels, and Bland Altman plots demonstrated congruence between data from the two types of <b>light</b> <b>meters.</b> The results provide promising data on how to measure patient exposure to ambient light dependably in the continuously changing and unpredictabl...|$|R

50|$|It {{is still}} a full-featured, fully {{mechanical}} SLR with a CdS TTL <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> and shutter-priority auto-exposure. The shutter speed range is 1s to 1/1000 and B, and the batteries (two PX625 mercury cells) are only needed for the <b>light</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Without its own {{development}} department, the Singapore {{production facility}} asked Rollei Germany {{for permission to}} make a redesign of the Rollei 35 B. The uncoupled selenium <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> {{was replaced by a}} new electronically coupled <b>light</b> <b>meter,</b> using variable resistors for transferring the aperture and shutter control settings to the <b>light</b> <b>meter.</b> The new designation Rollei 35 LED resulted from the three light emitting diodes in the viewfinder, which indicated overexposure, correct exposure, or underexposure. In October 1977 the first datasheet appeared and in January 1978 preproduction started. But the first models suffered from clumsy design of the power switch, which activated the <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> permanently. If the user forgot to switch the camera off, the battery was drained in just 15 hours. Furthermore, the PX-27 battery could be inserted the wrong way, causing damaged electronics. From August 1978 onward an improved model was made, where the <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> was only activated when the release button was depressed slightly.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{the first}} concept study got an {{immovable}} lens tube. The original movable sliding tube {{was one of}} the most expensive parts, because it had to be precisely manufactured on a lathe for a light tight fitting. The second concept study retained the sliding tube for the lens, but used a selenium <b>light</b> <b>meter.</b> A <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> for the accessory shoe was assigned to be built by Gossen in early 1968, but finally an uncoupled <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> was integrated in the camera housing.|$|E
50|$|Selenium and silicon <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> use {{sensors that}} are photovoltaic: they {{generate}} a voltage proportional to light exposure. Selenium sensors generate enough voltage for {{direct connection to}} a meter; they need no battery to operate and this made them very convenient in completely mechanical cameras. Selenium sensors however cannot measure low light accurately (ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits) and are altogether unable to measure very low light, such as candlelight, moonlight, starlight etc. Silicon sensors need an amplification circuit and require a power source such as batteries to operate. CdS <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> use a sensor based on photoresistance, i.e. their electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure. These also require a battery to operate. Most modern <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> use silicon or CdS sensors. They indicate the exposure either with a needle galvanometer or on an LCD screen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>meters</b> or <b>light</b> {{detectors}} {{are also}} used in illumination. Their purpose is to measure the illumination level in the interior and to switch off or reduce the output level of luminaires. This can greatly reduce the energy burden of the building by significantly increasing the efficiency of its lighting system. It is therefore recommended to use <b>light</b> <b>meters</b> in <b>lighting</b> systems, especially in rooms where one cannot expect users {{to pay attention to}} manually switching off the lights. Examples include hallways, stairs, and big halls.|$|R

A side-effect of the FT's <b>light</b> <b>meter</b> was a dimmer viewfinder.
