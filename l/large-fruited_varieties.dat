40|$|The {{domestication}} of {{the tomato}} Solanum lycopersi-cum and associated selective pressures {{eventually led to}} the <b>large-fruited</b> <b>varieties</b> cultivated today. S. lyco-persicum varieties are generally red-fruited, but display considerable variance in fruit colour intensity, shape, and quality. The increase in productivity on cultivation is, however, somewhat offset by the narrowing of the crops genetic base which leads to increased suscep-tibility to biotic and abiotic stresses. Since S. lycoper-sicum can easily be crossed with its wild species relatives, this exotic germplasm can provide a valuable source for the improvement of agriculturally important traits. A GC-MS based survey is presented here of the relative metabolic levels of leaves and fruit of S. lycopersicum and five wild species of tomato that can be crossed with it (S. pimpinellifolium, S. neorickii, S. chmielewskii, S. habrochaites, and S. pennellii). Changes in metabolite contents were identified in the wild species that are potentially important with respect to stress responses, as well as in metabolites of nutri-tional importance. The significance of these changes is discussed with respect {{to the use of the}} various wild species for metabolic engineering within wide breeding strategies...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{determine}} the genetic basis of exceptionally large tomato fruits, QTL analysis was performed on a population derived from a cross between the wild species Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium (average fruit weight, 1 g) and the L. esculentum cultivar var. Giant Heirloom, which bears fruit in excess of 1000 g. QTL analysis revealed that the majority (67 %) of phenotypic variation in fruit size {{could be attributed to}} six major loci localized on chromosomes 1 - 3 and 11. None of the QTL map to novel regions of the genome-all have been reported in previous studies involving moderately sized tomatoes. This result suggests that no major QTL beyond those already reported were involved in the evolution of extremely large fruit. However, {{this is the first time}} that all six QTL have emerged in a single population, suggesting that exceptionally <b>large-fruited</b> <b>varieties,</b> such as Giant Heirloom, are the result of a novel combination of preexisting QTL alleles. One of the detected QTL, fw 2. 2, has been cloned and exerts its effect on fruit size through global control of cell division early in carpel/fruit development. However, the most significant QTL detected in this study (fw 11. 3, lcn 11. 1) maps to the bottom of chromosome 11 and seems to exert its effect on fruit size through control of carpel/locule number. A second major locus, also affecting carpel number (and hence fruit size), was mapped to chromosome 2 (fw 2. 1, lcn 2. 1). We propose that these two carpel number QTL correspond to the loci described by early classical geneticists as fasciated (f) and locule number (lc), respectively...|$|E

40|$|Ascorbate redox {{metabolism}} and growth {{have been shown}} to be linked and related to the activity of enzymes that produce or remove the radical monodehydroascorbate, the semi-oxidized form of ascorbate (ascorbate oxidase or peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductase respectively). Previous work in cherry tomato has revealed correlations between monodehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbate oxidase activity and fruit yield: decreased whole plant MDHAR activity decreases yield while decreased whole plant ascorbate oxidase activity increases yield under unfavourable environmental conditions. We aimed to investigate if similar effects on yield are obtained in a <b>large-fruited</b> <b>variety</b> of tomato, Moneymaker. Furthermore we wished to establish whether previously observed effects on yield in cherry tomato following changes in whole plant enzyme activity could be reproduced by reducing MDHAR activity in fruit only by using a fruit-specific promoter in cherry tomato (West Virginia 106). In Moneymaker, RNAi lines for monodehydroascorbate reductase did not show significant yield decrease compared to control lines when plants were grown under optimal or non-optimal conditions of carbon stress generated by mature leaf removal. In addition, we show that a decrease in monodehydroascorbate reductase activity in fruit of cherry tomato had no effect on yield compared to a reduction in whole-plant monodehydroascorbate reductase activity: we therefore show that whole plant MDHAR activity is necessary to maintain yield in cherry tomato, suggesting that the carbon source in autotrophic tissue is more important than fruit sink activity. The present data also revealed differences between cherry and large fruited tomato that could be linked to a source of genetic variability in the response to monodehydroascorbate metabolism in tomato: maybe the domestication of tomato towards large-fruited lines could have affected the importance of MDHAR in yield maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Allocation {{of water}} for {{agriculture}} has decreased due to increased demand {{as a result of}} population growth, industrial development, and water pollution. Irrigation management aiming at efficient use of water has become a high priority. Deficit irrigation (DI), if applied judiciously, saves water, decreases vegetative growth and pruning costs, reduces leaching of agrichemicals into ground water, and may improve fruit quality. In apple, there is less beneficial effect of DI on shoot growth reduction because fruit set and cell division phases occur {{at the same time as}} predominant shoot growth and so DI applied during this period will reduce fruit size. However, there appear to be potential of DI in apple fruit quality improvement but research findings on this aspect have been inconclusive. To promote the adoption of DI in apple production, there is need to confirm and expand the effects of DI on fruit quality and to minimise DI effects on fruit size reduction. This study was to confirm DI effects on fruit quality by addressing relationship between fruit size and quality and to investigate DI effects on under-researched aspects of fruit quality such as physiological disorders, maturation and ripening, aroma volatiles, and storage potential. The possibility of integrating light crop load with DI to increase fruit size was also explored by investigating interactions of DI and crop load on tree water use, fruit size regulation, yield, and quality. The study involves three experiments. Irrigation treatments include control irrigation (CI), early deficit irrigation (EDI) applied from 63 to 118 days after full bloom (DAFB), late deficit irrigation (LDI) applied from approximately 118 DAFB until final harvest, and whole-season deficit irrigation (WDI) applied from 12 DAFB until final harvest. Crop load treatments, which were included in two experiments, were commercial crop load (CCL) and light crop load (LCL) equivalent to 60 - 67 % of CCL. 'Braeburn' apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) was used in all experiments. Deficit irrigation applied at any time during the growing season reduced fruit growth and size. Fruit size reduction by DI was counteracted by a lighter crop load. The interactions of DI and crop load on photosynthetic rate, fruit water potential, and fruit turgor potential (which were generally similar between CCL and LCL under CI but were lower in CCL under DI) are possible mechanisms for this counteraction. Tree water use (TWU) was reduced in DI and in LCL. The difference in TWU between CI and DI were greater at CCL than at LCL and that between CCL and LCL were greater under CI than under DI. Among the quality attributes studied, only firmness and dry matter concentration (DMC) were affected by fruit size with their values being higher in smaller fruit. The DI fruit were firmer and had higher DMC than CI fruit when comparing fruit of similar size. Total soluble solids (TSS) and total sugar concentration (TSC) were higher in DI fruit than in CI fruit in all experiments. In general, DI did not affect titratable acidity (TA) except for one experiment where TA at harvest was higher in EDI fruit than in CI fruit. Fruit ripened more quickly in LDI and WDI than in EDI which was similar in this respect to CI. The advancement in ripening of DI fruit appeared to be responsible for the enhanced production of aroma volatiles. This enhancement was observed on some occasions during ripening and after cold storage. Deficit irrigation may increase storage potential of the fruit as DI did not affect incidence of physiological disorders but decreased the weight loss during storage. The DI fruit were also firmer than CI fruit for at least 10 weeks of cold storage but this advantage was loss after longer storage due to the advanced ripening of the DI fruit. Apart from the enhancement on individual quality attributes, DI also improved overall fruit quality when many quality attributes were considered collectively using multivariate analysis. This was true both at harvest and after storage. There was no interaction between irrigation and crop load on any quality attributes under investigation. Light crop load improved fruit quality at harvest in terms of increased firmness, TSS, TSC and fruit density but increased weight loss during storage and incidence of bitter pit after storage. This research programme showed that deficit irrigation has a great potential as a strategy to save water and to improve fruit quality in apple production. 'Braeburn' is a <b>large-fruited</b> <b>variety.</b> Although fruit size was reduced under DI, DI fruit still met standard export requirements. In situations where price favours large size fruit, light crop load may be integrated with DI to increase fruit size but light crop load may adversely affect fruit quality after storage...|$|R
