40|$|The {{instrument}} {{insertion device}} (1) {{consists of two}} seal structures that have a tricuspid valve (2) and a <b>lipseal</b> valve (3) respectively, forming respective passageways (6, 8) through which the instrument is inserted. The passageway (6) moves from closed state to open state as the instrument is inserted and automatically moves from open state to close state as the instrument is removed. The passageway (8) moves from open state to closed state as the instrument is inserted and automatically move from closed state to open state as the instrument is removed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{show that}} hydraulic and pneumatic microactuators offer superior power and force densities at the microscale. The main technological barrier {{for the development}} of these actuators is the lack of microseal technologies. These seals must prevent the driving fluid leaking to the outside world without introducing friction. This paper presents a method to fabricate miniature <b>lipseals</b> in batch quantities. A simulation method for the design of these seals is developed and validated experimentally. Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators comprising <b>lipseals</b> have been fabricated and tested. These prototype actuators have an outside diameter of 1. 5 mm, and were able to generate forces of 1. 2 N at a supply pressure of 1. 6 MPa. status: publishe...|$|R
