50|$|The Green Tuff in Pantelleria {{contains}} rheomorphic structures {{which are}} held to {{be a result of}} post-depositional re-mobilization because at that time the Green Tuff was believed to be a fall deposit which has no <b>lateral</b> <b>transport.</b> Similarities between the structures in the Green Tuff and ignimbrites on Gran Canaria suggest post-depositional re-mobilization. This interpretation of the deposition of the Green Tuff has been disputed, suggetsing that it is an ignimbrite, and structures such as imbricate fiamme, observed in the Green Tuff, were the result of late stage primary viscous flow. Similar structures observed on Gran Canaria had been interpreted as syn-depositional flow.|$|E
50|$|The {{ocean is}} an {{extensive}} network of particle transport. Thorium isotopes can help researchers decipher the {{vertical and horizontal}} movement of matter. 234Th has a constant, well-defined production rate in the ocean and a half-life of 24 days. This naturally occurring isotope {{has been shown to}} vary linearly with depth. Therefore, any changes in this linear pattern {{can be attributed to the}} transport of 234Th on particles. For example, low isotopic ratios in surface water with very high values a few meters down would indicate a vertical flux in the downward direction. Furthermore, the thorium isotope may be traced within a specific depth to decipher the <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> of particles.|$|E
50|$|True tombolos {{are formed}} by wave {{refraction}} and diffraction. As waves near an island, they are slowed by {{the shallow water}} surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island {{to the opposite side}} as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift {{on the opposite side of}} the island. The beach sediments that are moving by <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.|$|E

50|$|Megafauna play a {{significant}} role in the <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance.

In South America's Amazon Basin, it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago. Given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region, the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains (both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the Andes) to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region's ecology, and the effects may not yet have reached their limits.|$|E

50|$|Cellular {{localization}} {{plays an}} essential role in the function of SMO, which anchors to the cell membrane as a 7-pass transmembrane protein. Stimulation of the patched 12-pass transmembrane receptor by the sonic hedgehog ligand leads to translocation of SMO to the primary cilium in vertebrates in a process that involves the exit of patched from the primary cilium, where it normally localizes in its unstimulated state. Vertebrate SMO that is mutated in the domain required for ciliary localisation often cannot contribute to hedgehog pathway activation. Conversely, SMO can become constitutively localized to the primary cilium and potentially activate pathway signaling constitutively {{as a result of a}} tryptophan to leucine mutation in the aforementioned domain. SMO has been shown to move during patched stimulation from the plasma membrane near the primary cilium to the ciliary membrane itself via a <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> pathway along the membrane, as opposed to via directed transport by vesicles. The cAMP-PKA pathway is known to promote the lateral movement of SMO and hedgehog signal transduction in general. In invertebrates like Drosophila, SMO does not organize at cilia and instead is generally translocated to the plasma membrane following hedgehog binding to patched.|$|E
40|$|The <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> of 2, 4 -D-C in {{horizontally}} orientated {{segments of}} Helianthus annuus hypocotyls has been studied. This auxin was asymmetrically supplied to one semi-circular cut {{end of the}} segments and the radioactivity transported to upper and lower receivers at the other cut end was determined. Since the total transport to receivers was independent {{of the position of}} the donors, and the <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> downwards to lower receivers through segments having upper sources was more than the lateral movement upwards to upper receivers through segments having lower sources, an actual polarized <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> from the upper to the lower side of the horizontal segments was indicated. The basipetally moving auxin made major contribution in giving rise to the lateral auxin asymmetry. C moving in the acropetal direction was less sensitive to the lateral effect of gravity. The polarized <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> did not rise in proportion to the auxin concentration supplied. At external auxin concentrations of 0. 2 and 1. 0 mg/l, 1411 per cent of the total C transported appeared to be moving laterallydownwards from the upper to {{the lower part of the}} horizontal segment. When the source concentration was 5. 0 mg/l the polarized <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> was 9 per cent of the total transport. The <b>lateral</b> <b>transport</b> continued to occur over the 11 -hour period tested.

Of the latter figure, 230 TgC/yr stem from the atmosphere, while the remainder 90 TgC/yr originate from carbonate mineral dissolution.

The tube entrance was then switched to a reservoir containing suspension of equal hematocrit, but with beads, for a short interval of flow at the same WSR. This process established a paraboloidal tongue of labeled suspension with a transient concentration gradient at its surface. The tube and contents were rapidly frozen to fix the suspended particles in flow-determined locations. Segments of frozen tube were collected at distances from the entrance corresponding to 13 %, 39 %, and 65 % of the axial extent of the ideal paraboloidal tongue. Concentration profiles were estimated from distances measured on fluorescence microscope images of cross-cut tube segments. Experiments used tubes either 40 or 50 cm long, suspension hematocrits of 0, 15, or 40 %, and bead concentrations in the range of 1. 5 - 2. 2 x 10 (5) /mm 3.

Measured mass accumulation rates (MAR) from sediment cores were compared to reconstructed MAR by multiplying the particulate rain caught in sediment traps by the Â²Â³â°Th focusing factor and subtracting measured dissolution. CaCOâ MAR is severely overestimated when the Â²Â³â°Th focusing factor correction is large but is estimated correctly when the focusing factor is small. In contrast, Al fluxes in the sediment fine fraction are well matched when the focusing correction is used. Since CaCOâ is primarily a coarse sediment component, we propose that there is significant sorting of fine and coarse sediments during <b>lateral</b> sediment <b>transport</b> by weak currents. Because CaCOâ does not move with Â²Â³â°Th, normalization typically overcorrects the CaCOâ MAR; and because CaCOâ is 80 % of the total sediment, Â²Â³â°Th normalization overestimates lateral sediment flux.
