40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Maternal {{mortality}} {{ratio in}} Tanzania is 454 / 100, 000 live births where by PPH alone accounts for 25 - 28 % of all maternal death (TDHS, 2010). PPH due to uterine atony {{accounts for more}} than 75 % of PPH in Tanzania (TDHS, 2010). It is an obstetric emergency that can effectively be prevented by conducting a cheap procedure called Active Management of the Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL). This study aimed at assessing knowledge and skills of midwives in conducting AMTSL for preventing primary PPH and to report barriers to its implementation in Municipal hospitals of Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania. Material and Methods: A comparative cross-sectional within subjects design was conducted at Amana, Mwananyamala and Temeke municipal hospitals of Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania. 87 midwives (30 from Amana 17 from Mwananyamala and 40 from Temeke municipal hospitals) out of all expected (105) who worked in labour and postnatal wards were studied. Data was collected by using questionnaire with four parts (demographic, training, AMTSL knowledge, policy/motivation/barriers information) contained both open and close ended structured questions. Practice of AMTSL was observed on normal vaginal deliveries by using a standard tool developed by Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Tanzania (MoHSW) in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO) in 2010. A satisfactory score in practice and knowledge was 90 %+ and 85 %+ respectively. A competent midwife on AMTSL had to obtain satisfactory scores in both knowledge and skills (MoHSW, 2010). Data was coded, entered, cleaned and analyzed in SPSS for windows version 15. Chi-square (X 2) test and Odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used to define the association of independent and dependent variables. A tool for <b>logistic</b> <b>assessment</b> was developed from the conceptual model that was developed after multinational study conducted in African Region in assessing the practicability of AMTSL. Participation in the study was purely voluntary. vii Results Majority of participated midwives performed well on what are considered the three most important components of AMTSL by ICM/FIGO (2003), (i. e. 10 IU of oxytocin (87. 4 %), CCT (92 %) and uterine massage (72. 4 %)). But there are 18 steps that comprise a standard AMTSL practice. When considering that standard observation guide and standard questions set on AMTSL, only 10 % of participating midwives achieved satisfactory standard scores in both knowledge and skills. Knowledge gave a strong association with being skillful (x 2 test, p = 0. 01 < 0. 05). Multivariate regression analysis signified association between place of training and competency level (x 2 test, p = 0. 02 < 0. 05), those who learnt AMTSL in midwifery/nursing school then got on job training were more likely to acquire competence on AMTSL than those who got from midwifery school alone, OR = 7. 143 (1. 017, 50. 188) (adjusted OR = 0. 140 (0. 020, 0. 984). All municipal hospitals had the AMTSL protocol, with enough supply of uterotonics in the previous two consecutive months stored under appropriate temperature. However, lack of on job training and shortage of staff and supplies were reported as major barriers that most midwives suggested were important for more successful AMTSL implementation. Conclusions and Recommendations. AMTSL Trials of Improved Practices (TIPS) and maternal outcomes can be conducted to determine barriers to the use of AMTSL and suggestions from providers on how to improve their practice of AMTSL and maternal health in achieving MDG 5. MoHSW should increased provision of on job training on AMTSL that fits with Tanzanian clinical environment and AMTSL job aids should be used, adapted and disseminated to all health facilities and Provided to pre-service educational programs while creation of ideal work environment (space, staffing, supplies and motivation) should be taken into consideration.

30|$|Through the {{discussion}} {{on the importance of}} <b>logistic</b> risk <b>assessment,</b> we can see that logistic risk refers to numbers of enterprises with complementary resources and technologies. Due to the fact that logistic risk does not change the independent legal personality in each node of enterprise in the market, it does not eliminate the potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, logistic also brings some new risk issues to alliance enterprises [3]. Risk is the uncertainty of the loss, that is, the possible negative deviation is combined with the expectation of the people’s decisions about the future behavior and the uncertainty of the objective conditions. The risks in the logistic can be divided into two categories: one is from the external of the virtual logistic organization, including market risk, financial risk, political risk, and natural disaster risk; the other one is from the internal of the virtual logistic organizations, which includes capacity risk, collaboration risk, investment risk, and operational risk.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the sustainability of a novel internet-based system for food logistics and to create a framework for more detailed future sustainability assessments. Digitalization enables food shopping via the internet and food delivery from producers to consumers using only a single terminal.

Given the frame of reference, there is a gap in the knowledge on the sustainability of food logistics. In addition, the current literature does not recognize a novel internet-based system for food logistics, as the literature has focused on evaluating the internet-based food logistics of traditional actors. The life cycle assessment results show that new food logistic options could reduce GHG emissions, but various factors affect the magnitude of the reductions.

The animals were randomly divided into four plots and placed on B. decumbens Stapf pastures. Three plots received concentrate supplement with different protein profiles and the fourth plot received only mineral supplement. Animals were weighed every 28 days to design growth curve of full body weight.

Within the frame of this study, pilot research (a case-control study) was conducted among 80 patients (20 cases and 60 control patients without periodontitis) to evaluate the risk for development of chronic periodontitis. The minimum sample size of patients was determined based on power analysis for sample-size calculation. The mean age of participants in the control group was 31. 33 § 9. 38 years and in the case group, 33. 00 § 11. 52. Data were accumulated by clinical and sociological methods. Descriptive statistics and multi-factor logistic regression analysis (Backward Conditional procedure) were used. One-factor dispersion analysis showed that, of the 12 studied risk factors, the following variables were significant: stress, diabetes, presence of calculus, overlapping and misaligned teeth (P < 0. 05). Multiple logistic regressions were applied to evaluate the association between the variables.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether an outsourced recruitment service can provide a satisfactory organisational solution from the perspective of its line-managers. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on a single, large organisation involving dissemination of an on-line survey targeting line-managers with a recent record of hiring new employees. Using quantitative analysis including correlation, multiple regression and binary <b>logistic</b> regression, <b>assessment</b> is made regarding manager perception, including experience as customers, overall rating of the recruiter and a willingness to recommend the service. Findings – Aspects of standard service, assessed in terms of operations and recruiter provision, are perceived as being at appropriately high levels, while the arguably more demanding external aspects of the recruitment process are perceived to be less successful. Line-manager satisfaction as customers and satisfaction with the recruiter are explained by various experiences of both service and recruiter, while willingness to recommend is explained in terms of customer satisfaction, satisfaction with the recruiter and recognition that the service provides added value. Personal line-manager experiences, perceived realisation of organisational values or achieving preferred line-manager recruitment objectives play no significant part in these explanations. Research limitations/implications – The research considered an individual organisation, with participating managers being solely from within. Further research could see the assessment being extended to other organisations perhaps at different points of maturity in their relationships with an external recruitment partner, as well as revisiting the participating organisation at a later point in time to assess potential changes in the relationships assessed. Practical implications – To enhance line-manager satisfaction with service and with the recruiter, aspects of process and recruiter contribution both play a role, while these satisfaction indicators, in tandem with an appreciation of added value will prompt a line-manager to ultimately recommend such a service. Originality/value – This centres on the assessment of an outsourced recruitment service from the particular perspective of its hiring line-managers, through evaluation of service satisfaction and willingness to recommend...|$|R

One hundred fifty-two first-ever stroke patients were recruited within 6 – 72 h after the onset of symptoms. Blood was drawn within 1 h after admission for deter-mining biomarkers. Cognitive function was assayed 2 weeks after stroke. The patients were divided into four groups: stroke, vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed dementia (MD). Forty healthy subjects were used as con-trols. The results indicated that lower soluble receptor levels for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and higher b-secretase enzyme (BACE 1) and neprilysin (NEP) levels were found in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups. In addition, the percentages of e 3 /e 4 genotypes and e 4 alleles in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups were higher than in the stroke group. Correlation analysis determined that sRAGE, BACE 1, and NEP were significantly related to the results of neuropsychological <b>assessments.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression analysis, however, suggested that only sRAGE and BACE 1 changed ahead of cognitive impairment after stroke.

40|$|Family-based designs protect {{analyses}} of genetic effects from bias that {{is due to}} population stratification. Inves-tigators have assumed that this robustness extends to assessments of gene-environment interaction. Unfortunately, this assumption fails for the common scenario in which the genotyped variant is related to risk through linkage with a causative allele. Bias also plagues other methods of assessment of gene-environment interaction. When testing against multiplicative joint effects, the case-only design offers excellent power, but it is invalid if genotype and exposure are correlated in the population. The authors describe 4 mechanisms that produce genotype-exposure dependence: exposure-related genetic population stratification, effects of family history on behavior, genotype effects on exposure, and selective attrition. They propose a sibling-augmented case-only (SACO) design that protects against the former 2 mechanisms and is therefore valid for studying young-onset disease in which genotype does not influence exposure. A SACO design allows the ascertainment of genotype and exposure for cases and exposure for 1 or more unaffected siblings selected randomly. Conditional <b>logistic</b> regression permits <b>assessment</b> of exposure effects and gene-environment interactions. Via simulations, the authors compare the likelihood-based inference on interactions using the SACO design with that based on other designs.

40|$|Objective: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that drug abuse and sexual intercourse have equal level of effects on HBV contamination. Drug abuse prevalence increases in adolescence period in Turkey. In the present study, it is aimed to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and risk factors of it among adolescent drug users, {{which is one of the}} most important health problems of our country. Methods: In the study, the medical records of the patients who were hospitalized between October 2004 and November 2007 at the inpatient service of Ege University Child and Adolescent Addiction Investigation and Practice Center (EGEBAM) were evaluated. Two hundred and six patients had been hospitalized within this period. Of 206 patients, 188 patients whose serological results were available were reviewed in terms of socio demographic features (n= 188), clinical properties (n= 188) and risk factors (n= 41). For the comparison of categorical variables, cross tabs and chi-square test, and for the risk <b>assessment</b> <b>logistic</b> regression analysis were used. P value less than 0. 05 (p< 0. 05) was considered to be statistically significant. Results: All of the 188 subjects recruited in the study were male and the mean age was 16. 4 ± 1. 4. It was found that; 69. 1 % (n= 130) of the subjects were using cannabis, 56. 4 % (n= 106) were using inhalant, 46. 8 % (n= 88) were using ecstasy and 42. 6 % (n= 80) were using alcohol.

40|$|Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at risk}} for {{infection}} with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Information on time trends in prevalence of these viruses among IDUs and in behaviors influencing their transmission can help define the status of these epidemics and of public health efforts to control them. We conducted a secondary data analysis combining cross-sectional data from IDUs aged 18 – 30  years enrolled in four Seattle-area studies from 1994 to 2004. Participants in all four studies were tested for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV), hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and HCV (anti-HCV), and completed behavioral risk <b>assessments.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was used to investigate trends in prevalence over time after controlling for sociodemographic, drug use, and sexual behavior variables. Between 1994 and 2004, anti-HBc prevalence declined from 43 to 15 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), anti-HCV prevalence fell from 68 to 32 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and anti-HIV prevalence remained constant at 2 – 3 %. Declines in anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence were observed within the individual studies, although not all these declines were statistically significant. The declines in anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence remained significant after control for confounding. Although we did not observe coincident declines in injection equipment sharing practices, there were increases in self-reported needle-exchange use, condom use, and hepatitis B vaccination. We conclude {{that there has been a}} substantial and sustained reduction in prevalence rates for HBV and HCV infection among young Seattle IDUs, while HIV rates have remained low and stable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{diagnosed}} with {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) face major daily challenges. Self-rated health (SRH) is a global measure of an individual's health related quality of life (HRQoL) {{and is based on}} the question, "In general, how would you rate your health?" Subjects rate their health as excellent, very good, good, poor or very poor. Our objective was to determine the HRQoL using the SRH measure and determine factors influencing responses. We hypothesized that better SRH responses were associated with shorter diabetes duration, better compliance and better glycemic control. Methods The standardized SRH measure was the instrument used for health related quality of life <b>assessment.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression analysis was used to examine the association between SRH responses and selected variables. Results 124 subjects, 64 females (51. 6 %) and 60 males (48. 4 %) were included. Average age was 13. 08 (± 3. 19) and average diabetes duration was 5. 82 (± 1. 60), while the mean HbA 1 C was 8. 02 (± 1. 60). The majority rated their health as good (31 %), 29 % rated it as excellent, 11 % as very good, 14 % as poor and 15 % as very poor. Regression analysis showed that regular exercise was the only predictor that was independently and significantly associated with a "better" self-health rating, with an OR of 12. 84, CI of 1. 425 - 115. 727 and a p value of 0. 023. Conclusion Regular exercise among Egyptian children with T 1 DM is strongly associated with a "better" overall health related quality of life and should be repeatedly encouraged. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Muscle {{impairment}} is {{a common}} condition in older people and a powerful risk factor for disability and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria to estimate the prevalence and investigate the clinical correlates of sarcopenia, in a sample of Italian community-dwelling older people. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 730 participants (74 % aged 65 years and older) enrolled in the InCHIANTI study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria using bioimpedance analysis for muscle mass <b>assessment.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression analysis was used to identify the factors independently associated with sarcopenia. RESULTS: Sarcopenia defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria increased steeply with age (p <. 001), with 31. 6 % of women and 17. 4 % of men aged 80 years or older being affected by this condition. Higher education (odds ratio: 0. 85; 95 % CI: 0. 74 - 0. 98), lower insulin-like growth factor I (lowest vs highest tertile, odds ratio: 3. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 14. 1), and low bioavailable testosterone (odds ratio: 2. 67; 95 % CI: 1. 31 - 5. 44) were independently associated with the likelihood of being sarcopenic. Nutritional intake, physical activity, and level of comorbidity were not associated with sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia identified by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria is a relatively common condition in Italian octogenarians, and its prevalence increases with aging. Correlates of sarcopenia identified in this study might suggest new approaches for prevention and treatment of sarcopenia...|$|R
40|$|Setting: A South African {{township}} clinic where loss to follow-up during TB {{treatment may}} prevent HIV-infected TB patients from receiving life-saving ART. Objective: To determine {{factors associated with}} loss to follow-up during TB treatment. Design: Regression analyses of a cohort of ART-eligible TB patients who commenced TB treatment and were followed for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Of 111 ART-eligible TB patients, 15 (14 %) died in the ensuing 24 weeks. Of the remaining 96 TB patients, 11 (11 %) were lost to follow-up. All TB patients lost to follow-up did not initiate ART. Of 85 TB patients in follow-up, 62 (73 %) initiated ART 56 days after TB diagnosis (median, IQR 33 - 77 days) and 31 days after initial assessment at an ART clinic (median, IQR: 18 - 55 days). The median duration from TB diagnosis to initial assessment at an ART clinic was 19 days (IQR: 7 - 48 days). At 24 weeks, 6 of 85 (7 %) TB patients who presented to an ART clinic for assessment were lost to follow-up, compared to 5 of 11 (45 %) TB patients who did not present to an ART clinic for <b>assessment.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio  =  0. 1, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 0. 03 - 0. 66) and our Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio  =  0. 2, 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 68) confirmed that assessment at an ART clinic during TB treatment reduced loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Assessment at antiretroviral clinics for HIV care by trained health-care providers reduces loss to follow-up among HIV-infected patients with TB...|$|R
40|$|Research Objective: To {{investigate}} {{predictors of}} pneumonia and subsequent hospitalisation in {{older adults with}} dysphagia. Methods: Adults aged 60 and over living {{in the community and}} in nursing facilities who exhibit signs of dysphagia. The 3 -oz water swallowing test was used to determine presence of dysphagia. Review of medical history examined for major chronic conditions, pneumonia diagnoses and hospitalization, dependence for activities of daily living (ADL), and number of medications taken at the time of <b>assessment.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was used to identify associations between various factors and pneumonia. Descriptive statistics were used to compare pneumonia cases with and without subsequent hospitalization. Results: Based on the 3 -oz water swallowing test, 98 were deemed dysphagic. Their mean age was 83. 5 years (SD= 7. 1), with 52 females. 86 needed some level of assistance with ADL; 64 needed help during mealtimes, 89 were not independently mobile. Univariate logistic regression revealed that male gender and neurological disease were highly predictive of pneumonia in elderly with dysphagia. Among the diagnosis of neurological disease, dementia seems the most likely predictor, however the promising odds ratio with a non-significant p-value suggests a larger sample size is needed, one of the limitations of the study. Comparison of descriptive statistics between the 3 groups supports the initial findings, as well as factors that did not emerge in regression due to the small sample size. Conclusions: Initial profiles are established for those with pneumonia, with and without hospitalisation, in older adults. These profiles can guide clinicians in flagging dysphagic patients who may be at risk for adverse outcomes, and provide adequate additional care...|$|R

Our aim was to assess which of three short questionnaires was most suitable for this identification among school-aged children Methods A community-based sample of 2, 066 parents of children aged 7 - 12 years (85 % of those eligible) filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and - randomly determined - one of three questionnaires to be compared: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire with Impact Supplement (SDQ), the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) and the PSYBOBA, a Dutch-origin questionnaire. Preventive Child Healthcare professionals assessed children's psychosocial functioning during routine health examinations. We assessed the scale structure (by means of Structural Equation Modelling), validity (correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity) and usability (ratings by parents and professionals) of each questionnaire {{and the degree to}} which they could improve the identification based only on clinical <b>assessment</b> (<b>logistic</b> regression). Results For the three questionnaires, Cronbach's alphas varied between 0. 80 and 0. 89. Sensitivities for a clinical CBCL at a cut off point with specificity = 0. 90 varied between 0. 78 and 0. 86 for the three questionnaires. Areas under the Receiver Operating Curve, using the CBCL as criterion, varied between 0. 93 and 0. 96. No differences were statistically significant. All three questionnaires added information to the clinical assessment. Odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for added information were PSC: 29. 3 (14. 4 - 59. 8), SDQ: 55. 0 (23. 1 - 131. 2) and PSYBOBA: 68. 5 (28. 3 - 165. 6). Parents preferred the SDQ and PSYBOBA.

40|$|In many {{epidemiologic}} data, the dose-response {{relation between}} a continuous exposure {{and the risk}} of disease abruptly changes when the exposure variable reaches an unknown threshold level, the so-called change-point. Although several methods are available for dose-response assessment with dichotomous outcomes, none of them provide inferential procedures to estimate change-points. In this paper, we describe a two-segmented logistic regression model, in which the linear term associated with a continuous exposure in standard logistic regression is replaced by a two-segmented polynomial function with unknown change-point, which is also estimated. A modified, iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is presented to obtain parameter estimates and confidence intervals, and the performance of this model is explored through simulation. Finally, a two-segmented logistic regression model is applied to a case-control study of the association of alcohol intake with the risk of myocardial infarction and compared with alternative analyses. The ability of two-segmented logistic regression to estimate and provide inferences for the location of change-points and for the magnitude of other parameters of effect will make this model a useful complement to other methods of dose-response analysis in epidemiologic studies.
