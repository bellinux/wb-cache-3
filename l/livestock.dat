5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and <b>livestock,</b> and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. <b>Livestock</b> production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to <b>livestock</b> profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, <b>livestock</b> produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. <b>Livestock</b> is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E

In December 2010, he launched a joint investigation with Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway into claims that the Eastern <b>Livestock</b> company had not paid Kentucky cattlemen for $130 million in <b>livestock.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the <b>Livestock</b> Conservancy {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Slow Food USA, Chefs Collaborative, and four other organizations to found the Renewing America's Food Traditions collaboration. The effort resulted in a book, Renewing America's Food Traditions, describing more than 1000varieties and species of food that are disappearing from the United States. The organization has written or published over a dozen books on heritage <b>livestock</b> breeds, including several on heritage poultry and waterfowl and more on general <b>livestock</b> conservation. Its conservation criteria and literature on <b>livestock</b> biodiversity are also widely used in independent publications on breeds. The Conservancy organizes an annual conference {{that focuses on the}} preservation and promotion of rare <b>livestock</b> breeds. For this conference, it partners with other organizations to teach members and other attendees about various aspects of rare breed <b>livestock.</b> For instance, in 2005, the organization partnered with the NAGP and the American Grassfed Association for a discussion on the cryogenic preservation of rare breed genetic material, which included a tour of the USDA <b>Livestock</b> and Poultry Gene Bank. In 2009, the Conservancy set up an online classified advertisement system to help users find and purchase rare breeds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Livestock</b> {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on <b>livestock</b> producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking <b>livestock</b> when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of <b>livestock,</b> while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended <b>livestock</b> in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted <b>livestock</b> species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack <b>livestock</b> when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack <b>livestock</b> to negatively affect it: the stress <b>livestock</b> experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of <b>livestock</b> guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as <b>livestock</b> guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger <b>livestock</b> such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are <b>livestock.</b> Widely agreed types of <b>livestock</b> include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered <b>livestock,</b> such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, <b>livestock</b> includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E

5|$|When {{targeting}} <b>livestock,</b> {{the spotted}} hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas {{in the southern}} parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region preferentially target donkeys. Reports of <b>livestock</b> damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The {{rate at which the}} species targets <b>livestock</b> may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where <b>livestock</b> is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of <b>livestock</b> predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.|$|E
5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains.

5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm <b>livestock,</b> particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young <b>livestock,</b> but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes are {{presently}} {{the most abundant}} <b>livestock</b> predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat, and cattle losses. For example, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths attributed to predation in 2004. The total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised 2.22% of the total sheep and lamb population in the United States, which, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA report, totaled 4.66 million and 7.80 million heads respectively as of July 1, 2005. Because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. The United States government agents routinely shoot, poison, trap, and kill about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect <b>livestock.</b> An Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were 5% as likely to attack <b>livestock</b> than individual wolves.|$|E
