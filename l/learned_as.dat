50|$|Instructional {{theory is}} {{different}} than learning theory. A learning theory describes how learning takes place, and an instructional theory prescribes how to better help people learn. Learning theories often inform instructional theory, and three general theoretical stances take part in this influence: behaviorism (<b>learning</b> <b>as</b> response acquisition), cognitivism (<b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge acquisition), and constructivism (<b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge construction). Instructional theory helps us create conditions that increases the probability of learning.|$|R

5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been <b>learned</b> <b>as</b> the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting <b>learned</b> <b>as</b> much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had <b>learned</b> <b>as</b> a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While the {{importance}} of viewing <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is gradually recognized (Paavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen, 2002; 2004), an important question remains to be answered- what represents an effective instructional design to support collaborative creative learning? This paper argues for a need {{to move away from}} efficiency-oriented instructional design to innovation-oriented instructional design if <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is to be pursued as an important instructional goal. The rationale in support of this argument is discussed from four different theoretical perspectives and an idea-centered, principle-based design approach as an example is proposed for discussion. In her work, Sfard (1998) distinguishes two metaphors of learning, which are <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> acquisition and <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation. Building on this work, Paavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen (2002; 2004) suggest a third metaphor—learning as knowledge creation. They identify Carl Bereiter’s (2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, in press) knowledge building theory, Nonaka and Takeuchi’s (1995) knowledge-creating theory, and Yrjo Engestrom’s (1999) expansive <b>learning</b> theory <b>as</b> three prominent models in support of the knowledge creating community conceptualization. While the argument for “learning as knowledge creation ” as a new pedagogical approach to schooling and education is well justified in their articles, an important issue remains to be explored-what represents an effective instructional design to support <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss two general types of instructional design approaches—efficiency-oriented and innovationoriented. It is posited that if <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation is to be pursued as a new pedagogical approach, instructional design will need to move away from an efficiency-oriented to an innovation-oriented approach. We discuss some design differences between the three learning metaphors in relation to these two types of instructional approaches from four theoretical perspectives to support this argument, and then propose an ideacentered, principle-based design approach as an example to support <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> knowledge creation...|$|R
40|$|The {{introductory}} chapter {{outlines the}} book&# 039;s central workplace learning themes from a socio-cultural perspective and situates them {{within the context}} of an Asia-Europe dialogue. Within this framework it problematises the idea of arguing that learning is not just acquisition, not just participation, but transformative of the self and circumstances, suggesting we need to consider <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> both acquisition and participation. However the acquisition metaphor or what Paulo Freire refers to as the banking concept of learning renders the learner(s) as passive, as having no agency, no will, no intent and that learners do not make their own meaning. Whereas <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation, deriving from the community of practice literature, places the emphasis on <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> being fundamentally social, as a matter of engagement, of the ability to negotiate new meaning, &# 039;as a process of changing understanding in practice&# 039; Unlike <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> acquisition, <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation recognises that learning is inherent in social relationships and that these relationships are embedded in practice, in the social setting of the practices and the activity of individuals and collectives. This is the strength of conceptualising <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation; however it does not account for the embeddedness of the wider social relations and conditions. Nor does <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> participation address the reality that we each bring our own understanding, our own mental image to what it is we are learning for. Our mental image, our understanding of an &# 039;object&# 039; is coloured by our individual and collective past experiences, our epistemological stance, our ethics and morals, our knowing. Therefore to understand learning {{we need to focus on}} who is doing the learning and under what circumstances...|$|R
