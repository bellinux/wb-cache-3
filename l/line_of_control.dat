5|$|On 13 September, after SAO Krajina forces {{captured}} Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, {{the conflict}} shifted north, where a new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was established south of ZNG-controlled Sunja and Novska. Daily skirmishes continued there. After the ZNG {{pulled out of}} Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, {{a substantial number of}} civilians left the area as well, leaving only about 120 Croat civilians in the two towns and the surrounding villages. About half of these stayed behind in Hrvatska Dubica, where looting and torching of houses owned by Croats or Serbs who had previously fled the town continued until mid-October. Most of the civilians who stayed in their homes were elderly or women.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} {{skirmish}} in Pakrac in March, a predominantly Serb-populated area {{east of the}} town, straddling the Pakrac–Bučje–Požega road, remained generally {{beyond the control of}} Croatian authorities. In early July, the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora. This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin–Osijek road, as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina. After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia (SAO Western Slavonia) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani, the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia—the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška—was severed. SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements. In order to address this deficiency, Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August. The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje, Daruvar, Pakrac and Lipik, and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia. The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar, but the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> remained in close proximity to the four towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{territory}} in dispute is {{in the vicinity of}} the town of Apatin, while the Island of Šarengrad and the Island of Vukovar are cited as particularly contentious parts of the dispute. Further disputed areas are located near the town of Bačka Palanka, and in the municipality of Sombor, at the tripoint of Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. Croatia claims that the cadastre-based boundary was adopted by the Đilas Commission, set up in 1945 to determine the borders between federal constituents of Yugoslavia, while Serbia claims that the same commission identified the boundary as the course of the Danube in 1945. In 1991, the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia ruled that the border between federal units of Yugoslavia became inviolable international borders, without referring to locations of any specific claim or line. The opinion was rendered at the request of Serbia. Prior to the ruling, Serbia asserted that the borders were subject to change following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia. Since the Croatian War of Independence, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> coincides with the Serbian claim.|$|E

25|$|India and Pakistan fought two further wars in 1965 and 1971.

25|$|In Paris Favre {{requested}} {{an officer}} {{to help him}} negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre {{had to get a}} postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, Charles Horix de Valdan, chief of staff to the commander of Paris, Joseph Vinoy, was sent along. Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and the area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral. When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the final document on 28 January 1871. It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas.|$|R

25|$|In late December, both {{countries}} moved ballistic missiles closer to each other's border, and mortar and artillery fire {{was reported in}} Kashmir. By January 2002, India had mobilized around 500,000 troops and three armored divisions on the Pakistan's border concentrated along the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> in Kashmir. Pakistan responded similarly, deploying around 300,000 troops to that region.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1999, alleged {{insurgents and}} Pakistani {{soldiers}} from Pakistani Kashmir infiltrated Jammu and Kashmir. During the winter season, Indian forces regularly move down to lower altitudes, as severe climatic conditions makes {{it almost impossible}} for them to guard the high peaks near the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control.</b> This practice is followed by both India and Pakistan Army. The terrain makes it difficult for both sides to maintain a strict border control over <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control.</b> The insurgents took advantage of this and occupied vacant mountain peaks in the Kargil range overlooking the highway in Indian Kashmir that connects Srinagar and Leh. By blocking the highway, they could cut off the only link between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. This resulted in a large-scale conflict between the Indian and Pakistani armies. The final stage involved major battles by Indian and Pakistani forces resulting in India recapturing most of the territories held by Pakistani forces.|$|E
25|$|Border {{disputes}} {{resulted in}} a short border war between the People's Republic of China and India on 20 October 1962. The border clash {{resulted in a}} defeat of India as the PRC pushed the Indian forces to within forty-eight kilometres of the Assam plains {{in the northeast and}} occupied strategic points in Ladakh, until the PRC declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 November and withdrew twenty kilometers behind its contended <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pangong Tso is in disputed territory. The <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> Actual <b>Control</b> {{passes through}} the lake. A section of the lake {{approximately}} 20 km east from the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> Actual <b>Control</b> is controlled by China but claimed by India. The eastern end of the lake is in Tibet. After the mid-19th century, Pangong Tso was {{at the southern end}} <b>of</b> Johnson <b>Line,</b> an early attempt at demarcation between India and China in the Aksai Chin region.|$|R

25|$|The 2001–2002 India–Pakistan {{standoff}} was {{a military}} standoff between India and Pakistan {{that resulted in the}} massing of troops {{on either side of the}} border and along the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. This was the second major military standoff between India and Pakistan following the successful detonation of nuclear devices by both countries in 1998 and the most recent standoff between the nuclear rivals. The other had been the Kargil War in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The Kashmir Valley is {{dominated}} by ethnic Kashmiris, who have largely driven the campaign for secession from India. Non-Kashmiri Muslim ethnic groups (Paharis, Gujjars and Bakarwalas), who dominate areas along the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control,</b> have remained indifferent to the separatist campaign. Jammu province region has a 70:30 Hindu-Muslim ratio. Parts of the region were hit by militants, but violence has ebbed there, along with the Valley, after India and Pakistan started a peace process in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The war {{marked the}} {{resumption}} of warfare between the two kingdoms that had been dormant since 1665. The inconclusive nature of this war would lead to more wars that would go on until 1854. From a geopolitical standpoint, Burma now had a firmer, though still by no means complete, hold on the upper Tenasserim coast. Still, the southward shift of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was strategically important. The Burmese would launch their next invasion from Tavoy in 1765, (not Martaban {{as was the case}} in 1759).|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "LAC" [...] gained legal {{recognition}} in Sino-Indian agreements signed in 1993 and 1996.

[...] However clause No 6 of the 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> Actual <b>Control</b> in the India-China Border Areas mentions, [...] "The two sides agree that {{references to the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> actual <b>control</b> in this Agreement do not prejudice their respective positions on the boundary question".|$|R
25|$|There {{were three}} major phases to the Kargil War. First, Pakistan {{infiltrated}} forces into the Indian-controlled section of Kashmir and occupied strategic locations enabling it to bring NH1 {{within range of}} its artillery fire. The next stage consisted of India discovering the infiltration and mobilising forces to respond to it. The final stage involved major battles by Indian and Pakistani forces resulting in India recapturing most of the territories held by Pakistani forces and the subsequent withdrawal of Pakistani forces back across the <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> after international pressure.|$|E
