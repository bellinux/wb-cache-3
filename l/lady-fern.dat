60|$|Her {{nature was}} the {{counterpart}} of the hill-side grove, where {{as a child}} she had read her fairy tales, and now as a woman turned the first pages of a more wondrous legend still. Lifted above the many-gabled roof, yet not {{cut off from the}} echo of human speech, the little grove seemed a green sanctuary, fringed about with violets, and full of summer melody and bloom. Gentle creatures haunted it, and there was none to make afraid; wood-pigeons cooed and crickets chirped their shrill roundelays, anemones and <b>lady-ferns</b> looked up from the moss that kissed the wanderer's feet. Warm airs were all afloat, full of vernal odors for the grateful sense, silvery birches shimmered like spirits of the wood, larches gave their green tassels to the wind, and pines made airy music sweet and solemn, as they stood looking heavenward through veils of summer sunshine or shrouds of wintry snow.|$|R

6000|$|So these departed. Early, one fair dawn, [...] The light-winged {{spirit of}} his youth {{returned}} [...] On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went, [...] So coming to the fountain-side beheld [...] Balin and Balan sitting statuelike, [...] Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down, [...] From underneath a plume of <b>lady-fern,</b> [...] Sang, and the sand danced {{at the bottom of}} it. [...] And on the right of Balin Balin's horse [...] Was fast beside an alder, on the left [...] Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree. [...] 'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?' [...] Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake [...] Of glory; we be mightier men than all [...] In Arthur's court; that also have we proved; [...] For whatsoever knight against us came [...] Or I or he have easily overthrown.' [...] 'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall, [...] But rather proven in his Paynim wars [...] Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not, [...] Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.' [...] And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down, [...] And lightly so returned, and no man knew.|$|E
6000|$|For it befell in that {{pleasant}} summer time, [...] "when small birds {{sing and}} shaughs are green," [...] that Thurnall started, one bright Sunday eve, {{to see a}} sick child at an upland farm, some {{few miles from the}} town. And partly because he liked the walk, and partly because he could no other, having neither horse nor gig, he went on foot; and whistled as he went like any throstle-cock, along the pleasant vale, by flowery banks and ferny walls, by oak and ash and thorn, while Alva flashed and swirled, between green boughs below, clear coffee-brown from last night's rain. Some miles up the turnpike road he went, and then away to the right, through the ash-woods of Trebooze, up by the rill which drips from pool to pool over the ledges of grey slate, deep-bedded in dark sedge, and broad bright burdock leaves, and tall angelica, and ell-broad rings and tufts of king, and crown, and <b>lady-fern,</b> and all the semi-tropic luxuriance of the fat western soil, and steaming western woods; out into the boggy moor at the glen head, all fragrant with the gold-tipped gale, where the turf is enamelled with the hectic marsh violet, and the pink pimpernel, and the pale yellow leaf-stars of the butterwort, and the blue bells and green threads of the ivy-leaved campanula; out upon the steep smooth down above, and away over the broad cattle-pastures; and then to pause a moment, and look far and wide over land and sea.|$|E
