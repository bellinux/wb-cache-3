2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final selector performed a sleeve test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of a cable {{breakdown}} or other similar event which may result in permanent loops on subscribers lines, after a predetermined time the register would be forcibly released and the subscriber put into a parked condition. This was possible because each subscriber had a dual armature <b>line</b> <b>relay,</b> and in the parked condition the low-current armature was operated but the other not. The scanners would ignore any park condition.|$|E
50|$|In most mid-20th-century {{switching}} equipment, {{a permanent}} signal would tie up a junctor circuit, diminishing {{the ability of}} the switch to handle outgoing calls. When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar line circuit designs had a park condition allowing the line circuit itself to monitor the line.|$|E

5000|$|Each line {{switch in}} this first, mixed bay has nine lines on nine of its {{vertical}}s, the tenth vertical being reserved for test purposes. In {{addition to the}} 90 lines on these switches, each LLF {{has at least one}} simple line switch bay, with ten more line switches carrying 200 lines. Thus the minimum size of a LLF is 290 lines for a line concentration ratio of 2.9:1. Optionally it has still another frame, with ten more switches and another 200 lines, and so forth, up to a maximum line concentration ratio of 5.9:1 since they all shared the same hundred line links. The line circuit is much like that in 1XB with a <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> for alerting the exchange to a trip condition, and the vertical off-normal contacts of the switch vertical serving as cutoff relay.|$|E
50|$|A picture above {{shows an}} STC SLU (Subscribers' Line Unit - {{in those days}} {{customers}} were always called subscribers, invariably shortened in conversation to 'subs'). It handled the traffic to and from five customers, and had five trunks going on to the B switches. There is therefore a 5×5 switching matrix of reed relays, which constituted the A-switch. Note that the four reeds {{in each of these}} reed relay were in-line, whereas in Plessey reed-relays the reeds were in a square formation. The SLU also contained 10 electro-mechanical relays, two for each line. They were the <b>Line</b> <b>Relay</b> (LR), which was operated when the customer picked up the handset and which generated the calling signal, and a K relay which gave the correct tones and prevented spurious calling conditions. These two relays both provided change-over contacts and therefore had to be electro-mechanical, because the reed-relays only gave make-break contacts. The face-plate of the unit is to the right: at the other end one can see the edge connector. It was feared that this type of connector would cause problems after a relatively low number of removal/re-insertion operations, but in practice they proved to be more than adequately robust.|$|E
50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|E

30|$|In the {{literature}} several techniques {{have been reported}} to solve the directional relaying problems of transmission line [20 – 23]. The algorithms are mainly based on voltage or current information. With large CCVT error correct direction estimation is a challenging task for many relaying algorithm. Sometimes relay correctly see the fault direction but further asserted which causes <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> to operate incorrectly [5, 10]. Distance relay algorithms are implemented with CCVT transient detection logic [24]. With such facility, new solutions can be provided to avoid relay malfunction. To obtain subsidence transient at the secondary side of CCVT, a new CCVT model is developed in EMTDC/PSCAD environment considering the nonlinear elements. Next, a current based approach is proposed which computes the phase angle difference between positive sequence post fault and prefault current. The impacts of voltage zero transient, voltage peak transient, passive FSC, different faults, fault resistance, high system SIR and fault location on the performance of proposed method are studied and results are compared with conventional techniques.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{system is a}} complex network of buses, loads, transmission lines {{in addition to other}} voltage and current regulating components. This complexity makes dealing with power system stability an ongoing challenge that has become more significant in recent years as renewables are integrated into the power grid. Solving these instabilities in the power grid requires a suitable model of the power system in order to analyze steady state and transient stability of such systems. In this paper, we consider an n-bus system model that consists of lossless transmission lines connecting generation and load buses. We develop a Hamiltonian function to represent the dynamics of this system and study the transient stability for selected system disturbances. These initiating disturbances may include transmission line failure, addition or removal of loads, short circuit or generator outage. In this report we focus is on simulating subsequent transmission <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> action following such disturbances, within a 14 -bus example power system. In particular we examine the impact of overcurrent relay action, which disconnects of one or more network branches, on the system?s transient and dynamic stability...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{compared}} {{the performance of a}} cellular OFDMA-TDD system enhanced with a MultiHop relay or optical repeater. In particular, we investigated bandwidth efficiency gained by a frequency reuse feature of a MultiHop relay along with outage performance subject to the co-channel interference under different resource allocation scenarios. In general, system throughput of the conventional IEEE 802.16 e mobile wireless broadband system can be significantly enhanced by either a MultiHop relay or repeaters. Furthermore, outage performance can be improved by repeaters or MultiHop relays with orthogonal allocation, since they improve C/I either by combining gain or by reducing the co-channel interference in the same cell, respectively. MultiHop relays will increase system capacity (almost doubling system throughput with the overlapped allocation), especially improving a per-user data rate in the cell edges or heavily shadowed areas. As these relays eliminate the need for a wire <b>line</b> <b>relay,</b> they facilitate rapid deployment and warrant economic feasibility. However, in the MultiHop relay system of overlapped allocation, there must be some means of circumventing the additional outage events around the subcell edges of the relay stations incurred by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station. One particular approach is a cooperative relay scheme that allows transmitting duplicate signals via multiple relay stations and then, combining them constructively in the receiver [15].|$|E
40|$|Stability of a {{power system}} is vital for its {{reliable}} operation and maintaining system stability {{has been a big}} challenge for engineers over the years. One way of improving system stability is the use of power system stabiliser (PSS). Its main function is to add damping to the generator rotor oscillation by modulating the generator excitation so as to develop a component of electrical torque in phase with the rotor speed deviation. In Ghana, two power stations have their generators equipped with PSS but none of the PSS are activated. The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess how the stability of the power system of Ghana can be improved by activating the power system stabilizers (PSS) on the excitation system of some of the generating units. To effectively perform the study the following questions had to be answered. &# 61558;	To what extent will the activation of the PSS on some generating units affect the overall system dynamic performance?&# 61558;	Where in the power system should the PSS be activated?&# 61558;	To what extend can the PSS reduces system oscillation? &# 61558;	What improvement can be made to the power system to optimise the performance of the PSS?Data of Ghana and the interconnected systems were first collected, reviewed and all the systems were modelled using PSSE program. Steady state stability studies were then performed to identify the inadequacy in the system during steady state operations. Five base cases including peak and average load condition with and without contingency were used for this study. Dynamic stability studies were also carried out by selecting appropriate dynamic models for generators, exciters and governors that best fit the dynamic behaviour of the generating units in the PSSE program. Appropriate PSS models were selected for units equipped with PSS based on manufacturers recommendation. Series of dynamic simulations were carried out to identify the best location and parameter settings for the PSS. Small signal stability studies were also carried out to complement the results obtained from the transient studies using NEVA. There was however a defect in the NEVA program and full results could not be obtained. In conclusion, Ghana s system is likely to experience voltage collapse during a transmission outage on some critical lines at peak period unless some loads are shed. This risk can be reduced by improving the power factor to 0. 95 using more reactive power compensating devices (capacitor bank) at the local substation. Transient stability results also show that the best location for the PSS to effectively damped oscillation is Akosombo GS. Inter-area oscillations of 0. 5 Hz between Ghana and Ivory Coast systems, local-area oscillation of 0. 8 Hz between the Akosombo units and Aboadze units in Ghana, were effectively damped within 7 sec with PSS at Akosombo GS. It is highly recommended that PSS at Akosombo generation station be activated since their application has a positive impact on the dynamic performance of Ghana s system. Steady state stability be improved by correcting the power factor at the local stations and <b>line</b> <b>relay</b> settings reviewed to accommodate the present operating condition. It is also recommended that the PSS be coordinated effectively with the protection and control devices for optimal performan...|$|E

Both the continuous-time and the discrete-time equations are given. The very poor estimates are explained by the equations determinant. At some isolated points the determinant approaches zero and the equations become singular. This results in useless, often extreme, estimates.
