The graphite mould is reusable many times, because the copper alloy is not as hot as the steel alloys used in rail welding. In signal bonding, the volume of molten copper is quite small, approximately [...] and the mould is lightly clamped {{to the side of}} the rail, also holding a signal wire in place. In rail welding, the weld charge can weigh up to 13 kg. The hardened sand mould is heavy and bulky, must be securely clamped in a very specific position and then subjected to intense heat for several minutes before firing the charge.When rail is welded into long strings, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction of steel must be taken into account. British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered [...] "stress neutral" [...] at some particular ambient temperature. This [...] "neutral" [...] temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures. The rail is physically secured to the ties or sleepers with rail anchors, or anti-creepers. If the track ballast is good and clean and the ties are in good condition, and the track geometry is good, then the welded rail will withstand ambient temperature swings normal to the region.|$|E
5000|$|From The Cornwall Chronicle, April 23, 1870: [...] "The Longford iron bridge {{has been}} {{constructed}} and erected under contract by Mr. C. de Borgue from designs {{prepared by the}} company's engineers, Messrs. Doyne, Major, and Willett. It is on the principle known as the double Warren girder, and consists of two spans, each of 200 ft. The girder is continuous, fixed in the centre but expanding and contracting at both ends, upon an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne. The girders are of lattice work, formed by building at top and bottom, strings of plate iron 2 ft wide on the bottom, and 2 ft deep. These are connected together by vertical and diagonal bars, the vertical bars being placed 14 ft apart, and the diagonals crossed between these. The size {{of each of these}} bars is arranged according to its position in the bridge, and in exact proportion to the amount of work it is to perform, a much smaller bar being used in tho centre than at the ends of each span. The top and bottom strings, on the contrary are much stronger in the centre than at the ends. The space between the upper and lower strings is 19 ft. The two main girders are connected together by cross girders at every 14 ft, and upon these are rivetted the beams which carry the permanent rails. The cross girders are rivetted to the sides of the lower strings, and the top strings arc connected by strong angle irons, thus giving great stability to the whole structure, which represents, in section, a square of 20 ft. A feature in this Bridge {{is the fact that the}} rivet holes instead of being punched as is the ordinary process, have all been drilled as true as a gun barrel; the consequence being that not a single hole required alteration, even where two or three plates had to be bolted together. The rivets were all made to fit the holes cold, and as they were put in at a red heat, and driven up by means of a circular steel cap, they all fit- as tight as though the holes had been rammed with some soft substance. Hence the extreme rigidity and elasticity of the structure. The ends of the bridge are to be set off by four massive fluted columns of cast iron, having handsome basements, and relieved by ornamental capitals, and over the centre also is a massive ornamental casting, which will agreeably break the line and relieve the appearance of the structure. These are the only pieces of ornamentation in which tho engineers have indulged. The height of the bridge and of the viaduct immediately beyond were both deter mined after a careful survey of the country and the most minute enquiries respecting the various flood levels. The bridge is now 2 feet 6 inch cm clear above the level of the highest recorded flood, and as it offers no impediment whatever to the passage of the waters, it is regarded almost as an everlasting structure. The abutments and centre pier are not yet quite complete, inasmuch as they have to be built up to the sides of the bridge, but the brick work and masonry of which they are composed, is very massive. They are sixteen feet thick, and stand upon a foundation of stiff clay. We are informed that a bed of cement concrete was laid 1 ft thick, upon which the brickwork was commenced. The average depth of the concrete bed from the surface of the ground is 26 feet m, so that the foundations are imbedded 27 ft or more below the river level. The abutments and piers are composed of brick, with ponderous blocks of hard blue stone, dove-tailed together under the girders, with quoins, caps, and copings of freestone quarried in the immediate neighbourhood, of the quality of which the engineers speak very highly. We have referred above to an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne, the object of which is to supply a means of compensation for the expansion or contraction in tho length of long iron girders, produced by variations of temperature and also to remove the pounding of the girder upon its support, caused by tho uudulatory motion produced in the girder by the passage of a heavy load. This has hitherto been effected by means more or less imperfect, and it is believed that this invention will prove a great improvement upon those which have hitherto been in use. The apparatus consists of a cast-iron circular plate seven feet in diameter and four inches in thickness, which rests on the top of the abutment. From the upper surface of this plate, five vertical ribs or jaws project upwards to the height of one foot nine inches. They are three inches in thickness and ten inches apart, running along the plate, in the direction of the girder, for its whole diameter. The upper edges of these ribs are grooved across the line of the girder, and in these grooves there rests a cast-steel turned pin 5 ftlong, and three inches in diameter. From this pin two steel links depend between each pair of ribs, making eight in number : they are three inches square, and are furnished with eyes at each end three inches in diameter, and bushed with brass. They are 16 inch cm long from centre to centre of the eyes, and hang nearly touching the ribs on one side, and leaving a space of nearly three inches between them on the other. This completes the description of the lower or abutment member of the apparatus. The upper girder member is nearly similar, but inverted; its plate, instead of being circular, is oblong. The ribs are four in number, and project downwards. They are placed between the links with the grooves opposite to the eyes. Through these, and through the eyes, a steel pin similar to the one described passes. Thus, the lower portion of the upper member is suspended from the upper portion of the lower member. The girder rests upon the iron plate, and as it increases or diminishes in length, through changes of temperature, it pushes forward or draws backward the whole upper member, causing it to swing freely on the suspending links, as if it rested on the tray of an ordinary swing. There is also a third motion, which takes place in the girders, which must be provided for in the bearings on the abutments, or serious vibration is produced. It is the undulatory or wave motion, produced by the changing deflections of the girders under the action of a moving load, which causes the ends of the girders to rock on their bearings. This motion is also perfectly provided for by Mr Doyne's apparatus, as the plate, on which the girder rests rolls freely on the lower pin, and thus destroys all pounding action on the abutment plate. It will be seen that when <b>longitudinal</b> <b>expansion</b> or contraction takes place in the girder, the lower pin moves forwards and backwards through the ribs of the lower member, and consequently the holes in these arc so formed as to give free play to this motion; they are of a radial oblong form, which has been termed [...] "balanoidal," [...] or bean-shaped." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the utility of left ventricular expansion velocities in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Background. Several {{studies have shown that}} left ventricular diastolic expansion is influenced by the elastic recoil forces of the myocardium. These forces are affected by intrinsic myocardial disease but should be preserved when diastole is impaired as a result of extrinsic causes. Methods. Using Doppler tissue imaging, we measured peak early velocity of <b>longitudinal</b> axis <b>expansion</b> (Ea) in 8 patients with constrictive pericarditis, 7 patients with restriction and 15 normal volunteers. Transmitral early (E) and late (A) Doppler flow velocities, left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, ejection fraction and mitral annular M-mode displacement were also compared between the groups. Results. The Eavalue was significantly higher in normal subjects (14. 5 ± 4. 7 cm/s [mean ±SD]) and in patients with constriction (14. 8 ± 4. 8 cm/s) than in those with restriction (5. 1 ± 1. 4 cm/s, p < 0. 001 constriction vs. restriction). There was weak correlation between Eaand the extent of annular displacement (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 004) and the E/A ratio (r = 0. 44, p = 0. 03). There was no correlation between Eaand E (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 07) or ejection fraction (r = 0. 21, p = 0. 26). By multivariate analysis, Eawas the best variable for differentiating constriction from restriction. Conclusions. Our study indicates that <b>longitudinal</b> axis <b>expansion</b> velocities are markedly reduced in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy.

40|$|We derive {{relativistic}} viscous hydrodynamic equations {{invoking the}} generalized second law of thermodynamics for two {{different forms of}} the non-equilibrium single-particle distribution function. We find that the relaxation times in these two derivations are identical for shear viscosity but different for bulk viscosity. These equations are used to study thermal dilepton and hadron spectra within <b>longitudinal</b> scaling <b>expansion</b> of the matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. For consistency, the same non-equilibrium distribution function {{is used in the}} particle production prescription as in the derivation of the viscous evolution equations. Appreciable differences are found in the particle production rates corresponding to the two non-equilibrium distribution functions. We emphasize that an inconsistent treatment of the non-equilibrium effects influences the particle production significantly, which may affect the extraction of transport properties of quark-gluon plasma.
