The prime measurements will be made by a CO 2 lidar instrument in the 9 to 10 micron range. These measurements will be complemented with the Goddard YAG Aerosol Lidar (YAL) data in two wavelengths, 0. 532 and 1. 06 micron, in the visible and near-infrared. The YAL, is being designed to utilize as much existing hardware, as feasible, to minimize cost and reduce implementation time.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to apply {{ergonomic}} controls in the soft drink beverage delivery industry, and measure the effectiveness in reducing musculoskeletal injuries through psychophysical, physiological, and biomechanical methods. Nine driver/sales workers with an average of 20 years experience participated in the study. Risk factors inherent in the job included exposure to whole body vibration from driving the trucks, pushing and pulling loads exceeding 350 pounds, repetitive lifting and moving of crates, slip and fall injuries, surface conditions, exposure to sharp glass from broken glass bottles, robberies, and moving products from bays into the trucks. All nine participants reported suffering a work related musculoskeletal injury, with eight reporting back injuries, five reporting arm injuries, and four reporting leg injuries. All had taken time off as a result of the injuries, with the average time off being 2. 8 months. The author recommends the use of several engineering controls, including drop down shelves; <b>low</b> <b>boy</b> tractor trailers; redesigned grab handles; antislip grit on bay rails, platforms, foot wells, and steps; additional foot wells; pullout steps; a dual hand truck holder with high back; adjustable height air cushioned seats; bay door straps; and relocation of the computerized beverage billing and printing system within the truck.

40|$|Fundamental {{movement}} skills {{form the}} foundation {{for many of the}} specific motor skills employed in popular sports and leisure activities. Little data exist on the prevalence and socioeconomic distribution of fundamental movement skill mastery among young children in Australia. This study process-assessed performance on six fundamental movement skills in a randomly selected sample of students from Years 1 through 3 in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales. The prevalence and sociodemographic distribution of mastery and near mastery for each skill and each skill component is reported for boys and girls in each school year. The findings revealed that the prevalence of mastery and near mastery of each of fundamental movement skill was generally <b>low.</b> <b>Boys</b> performed significantly better than girls in the run and in the four object-control skills (throw, catch, kick, and strike) whilst girls performed better than boys in the skip. There was no consistent association between prevalence of skill mastery and socio-economic status (SES), with only the kick and vertical jump for boys and catch, dodge, and vertical jump for girls differing across SES tertiles. Based on these results, we recommend that adequate curriculum time, resources, and professional development continue to be devoted to fundamental movement skills in NSW primary schools...|$|R
