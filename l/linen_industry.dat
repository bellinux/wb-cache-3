5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the <b>linen</b> <b>industry,</b> Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Brownlow and {{his family}} were {{released}} by the forces of Lord Conway, and as the rebellion ended they returned to their estate in Lurgan. William Brownlow died in 1660, but the family went on to {{contribute to the development of}} the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> which peaked in the town in the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
25|$|British cloth {{could not}} compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was {{approximately}} one-fifth that of Britain's. In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed Calico Acts {{in order to protect}} the domestic woollen and <b>linen</b> <b>industries</b> from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.|$|R
50|$|By 1920 growing {{unemployment}} in the <b>linen</b> <b>industries</b> and engineering sector were creating tension within the “Protestant bloc.” Large numbers of well organised ex-servicemen were still {{out of work and}} a cause of concern to the local middle class. It was the local middle class who alleged that ‘peaceful penetration’ of Belfast industry during the war by thousands of Catholics created the unemployment problem, especially that of the ex-servicemen. It would be the local middle class who succeeded in giving the conflict its sectarian twist.|$|R

5|$|Crewkerne and District Museum {{is part of}} a wider {{heritage}} centre {{which includes}} local archives and a meeting room. The museum opened in 2000 in an old house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council. The development of Crewkerne during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular emphasis on the flax and <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> is illustrated with a permanent display.

5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> was {{widespread}} in the Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
50|$|The Verdant Works are {{the only}} {{dedicated}} jute museum in the United Kingdom. As a museum, the Verdant Works {{tell the story of}} Dundee's textile industries, focusing primarily on the jute and <b>linen</b> <b>industries.</b> The production of textiles was the dominant industry in Dundee for many years, directly employing 50,000 people in the city (half the working population) {{by the end of the}} 19th century, as well as many more thousands in associated trades such as shipbuilding, transportation, and engineering. At the time Dundee supplied the majority of the world's demand for jute products, meaning it was also of importance for both Scottish and British histories.|$|R

40|$|Technical {{progress}} {{is the main}} lever for the further development of the socialist economy. Moreover, by securing a rise in labor productivity, it leads {{to the release of}} manpower. The intensity and forms of this process vary with branches and enterprises. However, the fact of its existence cannot be denied. It is confirmed, in particular, by the absolute reduction of the number of persons employed in a number of branches of the national economy. For instance, in the 1958 - 1962 period, the number of workers and employees decreased by 94, 400 in the coal industry, by 112, 700 in timber cutting, and by 46, 400 in the peat industry. There has been a {{decrease in the number of}} workers and employees in the cotton-cleaning, hemp-jute, and <b>linen</b> <b>industries,</b> in some branches of the food industry, etc. However, a direct connection cannot always be revealed between the reduction of employment in various branches of the national economy and technical progress. This process can also be due to the technical improvement of production in interconnected sectors of the national economy, or to a change in the pattern of output of various products. For example, the absolute reduction of the number employed in the coal and peat industries cannot be accounted for by technical progress in these branches alone. This is conditioned in considerable measure by a progressive change in the structure of the fuel balance, in which the share of oil and gas has increased. The chemicalization of the national economy exerts a similar influence on employment in some old, labor-consuming branches of production. This applies, in particular, to the cotton, hemp-jute, and <b>linen</b> <b>industries.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Linen was Scotland's premier {{industry}} in the 18th century and {{formed the basis for}} the later cotton, jute, and woollen industries. Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the British Linen Bank in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969. It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1727). Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system {{by the end of the}} century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|Helmshore {{owes its}} {{development}} to a damp climate that was {{ideally suited to}} the development of the wool, cotton and <b>linen</b> <b>industries.</b> During the early part of the Industrial Revolution, from the 1790s on, small mills were built on the river valleys, such as Alden valley where there are still ruins, close to the farming areas - indeed most mill-owners were also farmers. But by the latter half of the nineteenth century these mills became redundant and industry expanded enormously as mill owners such as the Turner family built terraced dwellings to house the workforce necessary to run their cotton mills close to the roads and railways. During this period Helmshore gradually superseded Musbury as the main name for the community.|$|R

25|$|The ship {{building}} {{district of}} Zaan, near Amsterdam, {{became the first}} industrialized area in the world, with around 900 industrial windmills {{at the end of}} the 17th century, but there were industrialized towns and cities on a smaller scale also. Other industries that saw significant growth were papermaking, sugar refining, printing, the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> (with spin-offs in vegetable oils, like flax and rape oil), and industries that used the cheap peat fuel, like brewing and ceramics (brickworks, pottery and clay-pipe making).|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} the {{fortunes}} of Dunfermline lasted until {{the introduction of a}} <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> in the early 18th century. One reason for which the town became a centre for linen was there was enough water to power the mills and nearby ports along the Fife Coast. These ports also did trade with the Baltic and Low Countries. Another reason was through an act of industrial espionage in 1709 by a weaver known as James Blake who gained access to the workshops of a damask linen factory in Edinburgh by pretending to act like a simpleton in order to find out and memorise the formula. On his return to his home town in 1718, Blake established a damask <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> in the town. The largest of these factories was St Leonard's Mill which was established by Erskine Beveridge in 1851. A warehouse and office block was later added around 1869. Other linen factories were built on land to both the north and south ends of the burgh. During the mid-19th century, powerloom weaving started to replace linen damask. The latter did not survive, going into decline straight after the end of First World War. In 1909 the Royal Navy established Scotland's only Royal Naval Dockyard at nearby Rosyth.|$|E
25|$|Sir Richard Cox, Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1703 to 1707, was the town's most {{important}} early patron.

To that end, Cox imported artisans from Ulster to teach the required skills. He sponsored numerous incentives for local residents involved in making linen, including rent-free housing for top producers, bonuses for efficient labourers, rewards for schoolgirls who showed strong loom skills, and production contests with generous prizes. In 1735, the town consisted of forty houses and two to three hundred people. By 1747, the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> was well established, and Cox's personal census recorded 557people. Two years later, it rose to 807.|$|E

500|$|Cloth {{manufacture}} {{was largely}} domestic. Rough plaids were produced, {{but the most}} important areas of manufacturing was linen, particularly in the Lowlands, with some commentators suggesting that Scottish flax was superior to Dutch. The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty on linen and from 1727 it received subsidies of £2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. These funds were derived from the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, using money set aside at the Union. It distributed £6,000 a year to encourage industry, particularly the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> and fishing. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738. The move of the British Linen Company in 1746 into advancing cash credits also stimulated production. The trade was soon being managed by [...] "manufacturers" [...] who supplied flax to spinners, bought back the yarn and then supplied to the weavers and then bought the cloth they produced and resold that.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the village}} {{consisted}} of linen weavers' cottages, {{to support the}} large flax growing and <b>linen</b> weaving <b>industry</b> of Fife in the 17-1800s.

50|$|The embargo {{also had}} an effect on France itself. Ship building, and its trades such as rope-making declined, as did many other {{industries}} that relied on overseas markets, such as the <b>linen</b> <b>industries.</b> With few exports and a loss of profits, many industries were closed down. Southern France, especially the port cities of Marseille and Bordeaux as well as the city of La Rochelle, suffered from the reduction in trade. Moreover, the prices of staple foods rose for most of continental Europe.Napoleon's St. Cloud Decree in July 1810 opened the southwest of France and the Spanish frontier to limited British trade, and reopened French trade to the United States. It was an admission that his blockade had hurt his own economy more than the British. It also failed to reduce British financial support to its allies. The industrialized north and east of France, and south of today's Belgium saw significantly increased profits {{due to the lack of}} competition from British goods (particularly textiles, which were produced much more cheaply in Britain).In Italy, the agricultural sector flourished.The Dutch economy, predicated on trade, suffered greatly as a result of the embargo. Napoleon's economic warfare was much to the chagrin of his own brother, King Louis I of Holland.|$|R
500|$|Poulton's {{commercial}} importance {{was affected}} by {{the growth in the}} 19thcentury of two nearby coastal towns. In 1836 the first building was constructed in the new, planned town of Fleetwood, [...] north of Poulton, {{at the mouth of the}} River Wyre. Fleetwood was conceived by local landowner and Preston Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood as a major port and a link for passengers travelling from London to Scotland. To achieve these ideals, a rail link was needed and the new town soon heralded the arrival of the railway to the area. A line connecting Fleetwood with Preston was completed in 1840, with Poulton as one of the stops. Although Fleetwood immediately superseded Poulton as a port (the Customs House was quickly moved to Fleetwood), Poulton initially benefited commercially from the rail link. The importation of Irish and Scottish cattle through Fleetwood enabled a fortnightly cattle market to be held in Poulton. At the same time, Blackpool was developing as a resort and for a few years visitors travelled by rail to Poulton and then on to Blackpool by horse-drawn charabancs or omnibuses. A line between Poulton and Blackpool was completed in 1846. As Fleetwood and Blackpool's own commercial capabilities developed, and Kirkham's prominence in the <b>linen</b> <b>industry</b> continued to grow, Poulton's importance declined.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, {{there was}} a process of the {{rehabilitation}} of highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers {{until the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, but by the nineteenth century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region. In the 1820s, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycle and further popularised by the works of Scott. His [...] "staging" [...] of the royal visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish <b>linen</b> <b>industry.</b> Individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period, and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity. This [...] "Highlandism", by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria's interest in the country, her adoption of Balmoral as a major royal retreat and her interest in [...] "tartanry".|$|E
500|$|In the 13thcentury, Poulton's {{economy was}} largely agricultural. Over the next centuries, the town became a {{commercial}} centre for the area, importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys. Imports of flax were vital {{for a local}} <b>linen</b> <b>industry,</b> particularly in nearby Kirkham, and Poulton craftsmen were part of this industry {{by the beginning of}} the 19thcentury. During the early part of this century the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton. New methods were not embraced by local producers and the town suffered from its location, far from coalfields and large labour markets. Following the development of the new town and port of Fleetwood from 1836, Poulton's role as a major commerce centre waned. For some time, the town's market remained important as a local supply of goods for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool. Eventually Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool. In his 1837 work on Blackpool, William Thornber called Poulton the [...] "metropolis of the Fylde". This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was Thornber's description of the town no longer apt, it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, the British {{government}} {{passed an}} act outlawing {{the export of}} [...] "tools or utensils" [...] used in the cotton and <b>linen</b> <b>industries.</b> As a result, {{the only way for}} the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through industrial espionage. Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright's inventions to Johann Gottfried Brugelmann; Brugelmann used the information to establish a mill in Ratingen, near Düsseldorf, which began production in 1784. He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford. The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe. The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America. In 1790, the United States had less than 2,000 spindles which were powered by spinning jennys, compared to 2.4million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time. The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by unskilled migrants from England, many of them being unskilled. Among them was Samuel Slater who was from the Derwent Valley and an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt. He founded Slater Mill. Many of the technologies developed in the Derwent Valley Mills endured and were adopted for other textile industries; until the mid-20th century, carding was still performed with machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. The factory system made it possible to produce cheap textiles and clothing.|$|R
