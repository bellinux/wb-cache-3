Finite element {{analysis was used}} to study three conditions of pipe riser – uncorroded, corroded and corroded and repaired with designated <b>laminate</b> <b>orientation</b> of carbon/epoxy or E-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced composite. The behaviour of the pipe riser (grade API 5 L X 60 steel) was studied using Ramberg–Osgood model. Two composites laminate systems, a pre-cured prepreg (grade AS 4 3501 - 6 carbon/epoxy) and a wet-layup filament-wounded composite (grade Gevetex LY 556 /HT 917 /DY 063 E-glass/epoxy), were characterised. Design conditions were determined via a limit analysis known as the double-elastic slope method. The results showed that under combined hoop, tensile and bending loads, the riser tends to approach failure at a much lower strain compared with each of these loads being applied individually. The limiting design factor of the composite repair system was due to excessive tensile strain experienced in a bent riser while the compressive stress caused by reversing the bending load occurred well within the linear-elastic region. With respect to the types of composite repair system, carbon fibre displayed a much better strength rehabilita-tion over glass fibre.

40|$|Predicting the {{residual}} strength of composite laminates {{in the presence}} of flaws such as cracks has been an important research problem for the last two decades. Most existing models for predicting notched residual strength are of a 2 ̆ 7 curve fit 2 ̆ 7 nature, wherein the model parameters, e. g., characteristic distance or damage zone size are chosen so as to fit the experimental data. Such parameters have been shown to depend on notch size and <b>laminate</b> <b>orientation,</b> and as such, cannot be considered material constants for the composite system. In the present research, a new model is proposed for predicting residual strength or fracture toughness of notched fiber dominated composite laminates under pure Mode I or mixed-mode loading conditions. The fracture toughness of such laminates is related to the fracture toughness of the principal load bearing plies within them. A new material parameter is introduced to predict laminate fracture toughness, and it is shown to be independent of <b>laminate</b> <b>orientation.</b> Experimental results indicate that the model can successfully predict the failure stress for notched laminates with arbitrary crack orientations (mixed-mode loading). The effect of ply thickness on notched strength of cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates is also investigated in this study. Results indicate that the ply thickness effect is more significant in cross-ply laminate configurations. ^ A 2 D finite element analysis is conducted to study the effect of crack tip damage in the form of splitting and delamination on the stress distribution near the crack tip. The experimentally observed damage zones in cross-ply laminates are modeled, and a criterion is established to predict the growth of matrix cracks in the 0 ∘ layer. It is shown that the matrix crack growth is controlled by the Mode II strain energy release rate. The effect of matrix damage on stress relaxation and subsequent failure is investigated and conclusions are drawn to establish the regime where the failure model is valid. ...|$|E

It is shown that the linear elastic range of the T 6 - and T 6 N-condition specimens is larger than that of the as-fabricated specimens, and that cyclic loading in tension or compression strain hardens the specimens and extends the linear elastic range. For laminates containing 0 -deg plies, the stress-strain behavior upon unloading is found to be nonlinear, whereas the other laminates exhibit a linear behavior upon unloading.

40|$|Fixed wing micro air {{vehicles}} (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging {{due to the}} low Reynolds number regime (104 - 105) {{they operate}} in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10 - 15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, {{and the range of}} stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with geometric twist (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here.

40|$|Physical {{testing of}} {{laminated}} structures {{has indicated that}} the compressive strength is often considerably lower than that predicted by analytical methods. Poor testing techniques and poorly constructed materials seem to be possible reasons for the premature failure. However, {{since many of the}} failures are characterized by delamination of the structures, the cause of the failure may be due to local buckling of the composite plies. In this dissertation, a ply buckling model is studied to assist in the understanding of the failure mechanisms. In order to find the failure envelope, inplane fracture and overall buckling are assumed as the failure modes of these structures. The classical theory of elasticity for thin shells, including transverse shear deformation, is used in the derivation.

By using predictions, a parametric study was also made of factors that influence fracture toughness. Fiber and matrix properties as well as lay-up were investigated. Without crack-tip splitting, fracture toughness increases in proportion to fiber strength and fiber volume fraction, increases linearly with E(22) /E(11), is largest when the modulus for non- 0 deg fibers is greater than that of 0 deg fibers, and is smallest for 0 (m) / 90 (p) (s) lay-ups.

40|$|SUMMARY Seventy-nine {{advanced}} composite compression specimens, fabricated from HTS- 1 /PMR- 15 and HTS- 2 /PMR- 1 5 graphite/polyimide material, were tested to investigate experimentally the IITRI test method for determining compressive properties of composite materials at room and elevated temperatures (589 K (600 ° F)). Minor modifications {{were made to}} the standard IITRI fixture and a high degree of precision was maintained in specimen fabrication and load alignment. Specimens included four symmetric <b>laminate</b> <b>orientations</b> designated as [o], [0,± 45, 90] 2 S, [90], and [+ 45] 5 S. Specimens 0. 635, 1. 27, 1. 91, and 2. 54 cm (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0 in.) wide were tested to evaluate the effect of width on measured modulus and strength. In most cases three specimens of each width were tested at room and elevated temperature and a polynomial regression analy-sis was used to reduce the data. Tangent modulus, Poisson's ratio, and com-pressive ultimate strengths and strains were determined for [o] 15, [ol 16, [90] 20 / [0,+ 45, 90] 2 s, and [+ 45] 5 S graphite/polyimide laminates. A statistical analysis of the data is presented to evaluate test scatter and property varia-tion with respect to load, temperature, and specimen geometry. Scatter of replicate tests and back-to-back strain variations were low, and no specimens failed by instability. Variation of specimen width had a negligible effect on the measured ultimate strengths and initial moduli of the specimens. Measured compressive strength and stiffness values were suffi-ciently high for the material to be considered a usable structural material at temperatures as high as 589 K (600 ° F) ...|$|R
