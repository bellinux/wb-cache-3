40|$|Four {{types of}} tobacco are {{produced}} in Virginia: flue-cured, dark fire-cured, <b>light</b> <b>air-cured</b> (burley) and dark air-cured (sun-cured). Virginia produces 28 {{percent of the}} flue-cured tobacco grown in the United States. Flue-cured tobacco is used almost exclusively in cigarettes. Approximately 40 percent of that grown in Virginia is exported as non-manufactured leaf. Almost 8 percent of all dark fire-cured tobacco is produced in Virginia. The majority of dark fire-cured tobacco is exported for the manufacture of smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, and cigars. The primary domestic use is for dry snuff. Virginia farmers produce 4 percent of the <b>light</b> <b>air-cured</b> (burley) tobacco grown. Burley tobacco is used primarily in cigarette blends {{with a small amount}} used in the manufacture of pipe and chewing tobacco products. Approximately 30 percent of the burley tobacco grown in Virginia is exported. Virginia produces about 1. 5 percent of the dark air-cured (sun-cured) tobacco grown in the United States. Most of it is exported for making smoking and chewing tobacco. A small portion is used domestically for plug chewing tobacco (9, 14, 15). In 1994, the gross income from tobacco production in Virginia was approximately $ 182 million. The gross value of tobacco averages between $ 3, 750 and $ 7, 000 per acre. Typical production costs for flue-cured tobacco in 1994 were about $ 2, 673 per acre (10) ...|$|E

40|$|Once iconic American symbols, tobacco {{farms are}} {{gradually}} disappearing. It {{is difficult for}} many people to lament {{the loss of a}} crop that has come to symbolize addiction, disease, and corporate deception; yet, in Kentucky, the plant has {{played an important role in}} economic development and prosperity. Burley tobacco—a <b>light,</b> <b>air-cured</b> variety used in cigarette production—has long been the Commonwealth’s largest cash crop and an important aspect of regional identity, along with bourbon, bluegrass music, and Thoroughbred horses. In Burley: Kentucky Tobacco in a New Century, Ann K. Ferrell investigates the rapidly transforming process of raising and selling tobacco by chronicling her conversations with the farmers who know the crop best. She demonstrates that although the 2004 “buyout” ending the federal tobacco program is commonly perceived to be the most significant change that growers have had to negotiate, it is, in reality, only one new factor among many. Burley reveals the tangible and intangible challenges tobacco farmers face today, from the logistics of cultivation to the growing stigma against the crop. Ferrell uses ethnography, archival research, and rhetorical analysis to tell the complex story of burley tobacco production in twenty-first-century Kentucky. Not only does she give a voice to the farmers who persevere in this embattled industry, but she also sheds light on their futures, contesting the widely held assumption that they can easily replace the crop by diversifying their operations with alternative crops. As tobacco fades from both the physical and economic landscapes, this nuanced volume documents and explores the culture and practices of burley production today. Awarded the 2014 Wayland D.
