5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor {{to see how she}} is doing. Pregnant women {{have to deal with the}} pregnancy with the help of other women while the men go along their day <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.|$|E
25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or bait fishing is that in fly fishing {{the weight of the}} line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and bait fishing the weight of the lure or sinker {{at the end of the}} monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|E
25|$|Before World War I, Gleizes {{had always}} been {{identified}} as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and Surrealism. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to call himself a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or De Stijl) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> else that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.|$|E

25|$|After {{dropping}} the nixies {{in a nearby}} pond (their reward for having sung to the giants), Jules, Laurie and Nick pass by Cindy's house and notice a large sinkhole close to it. When they go to warn Cindy and her parents, Laurie and Sandspur fall into the growing sinkhole and a tree falls on Jules's legs when attempting to rescue her. When Nick tries to help Laurie {{get out of the}} sinkhole, he finds that she still hadn't died from the methane exhaled by the dragons because Sandspur (who had grown to a huge size, revealing himself to be a spriggan) had been eating them, proceeding to eat Nick whole and only regurgitating him when Laurie drops rocks into the creature's mouth to make him sick. Nick and Laurie get out of the sinkhole and go back to meet Jack Jr. and the Grace kids, leaving Jules at Cindy's house waiting for an ambulance (being followed back by Sandspur, back in his small size, <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened).|$|E
25|$|After the {{way they}} had left the AWA Michaels and Jannetty could not just return <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened, instead the Midnight Rockers started working for the AWA {{affiliated}} Championship Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Tennessee. The team had made a couple of appearances in the CWA in the past as part of their working agreement with the AWA but now they were in Memphis full-time. Their first feud in Memphis was against a recently formed team known as The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) whom they faced in several brutal matches all over the CWA territory. After The Nasty Boys, The Rockers got involved in a feud with “The Nightmares” (Danny Davis and Ken Wayne). Their villainous personas were that of self-obsessed, glory seeking ”superstars”, the same persona Michaels would later adopt as ”The Hearbreak Kid”. Their feud with the RPMs saw the Midnight Rockers defeat Lane and Davis to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on October 26, 1987. Jannetty and Michaels lost then regained the Southern Tag Team title as the Midnight Rockers / RPMs feud raged on.|$|E

[...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Tchaikovsky's {{music has}} also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect {{for not being}} nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason.

[...] Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition [...] "whose stink one can hear" [...] and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, [...] "The furious peroration sounds <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker.

[...] Jordan Blum of PopMatters thinks that the album [...] "paved the way for modern progressive rock" [...] and [...] "today, it represents not only a pinnacle achievement for Jethro Tull, but also a concrete example of just how adventurous and free artists used to be." [...] Record Collector reviewer writes that [...] "today, free from the irrelevant context of misdiagnosis and derision that dogged it on its original release, the album sounds <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> less than an Olympian feat of composition and musicianship."

500|$|Roger Moore wrote, [...] "Daniel Craig {{impressed}} me so greatly in his debut outing, Casino Royale, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined {{edge to the}} character that I thought Sean [...] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted." [...] So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD. Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, called Casino Royale [...] "a perfect Bond film." ...|$|E
