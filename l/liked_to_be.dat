5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

She also took special pains on behalf of Mary of Guelders, who attended upon Catherine. Isabella helped arrange her marriage to James II of Scotland, which would make her queen.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Eccleston {{discussed}} {{plans for}} the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor.

Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann. However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

500|$|Because a {{large amount}} of the action in [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] takes place in Bubblegum's bedroom, Moynihan was worried that the scenes would not carry {{interest}} and [...] "people would get bored". As such, Moynihan and Sanchez created the scenes [...] "trying to be simultaneously funny and terrifying". Ward noted that he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "laughing and freaked out", and that the scenes work in this manner. Former storyboard artist Adam Muto commented that the possession scenes turned out [...] "nice and off-putting". Jones-Quartey called the shot of a possessed Princess Bubblegum melting [...] "terrifying". Although the series tries to avoid [...] "cartoon physics", Sanchez and Moynihan were forced to work around this during the scene when Bubblegum throws Finn and Jake through a wall without harming them. Moynihan later rationalized that the wall was made of candy, and thus was harmless.|$|E
500|$|Olivier {{was born}} in Dorking, Surrey, the {{youngest}} of the three children of the Revd Gerard Kerr Olivier (1869–1939) and his wife Agnes Louise, née Crookenden (1871–1920). Their elder children were Sybille (1901–1989) and Gerard Dacres [...] "Dickie" [...] (1904–1958). His great-great-grandfather was of French Huguenot descent, and Olivier came {{from a long line of}} Protestant clergymen. Gerard Olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster, but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious vocation and was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He [...] practised extremely high church, ritualist Anglicanism and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed as [...] "Father Olivier". This made him unacceptable to most Anglican congregations, and the only church posts he was offered were temporary, usually deputising for regular incumbents in their absence.
