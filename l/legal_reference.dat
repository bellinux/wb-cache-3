The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's {{our duty to}} look at any crime that comes to us[...] [...] After the regime has fallen, {{we believe that the}} Muslim {{majority}} in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very {{important to point out that}} some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all."

This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [...] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished." ...|$|E
