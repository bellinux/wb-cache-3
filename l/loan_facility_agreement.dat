50|$|VTB Capital plc {{claimed that}} Nutritek, its parent and a {{director}} called Konstantin Malofeev, fraudulently misrepresented {{the value of}} dairy companies that Nutritek was selling to Russagroprom LLC. VTB was giving a $225m loan to Russagroprom to buy the dairy companies. VTB claimed that it was deceived into thinking that Russagroprom was not already under common control with Nutritek. It additionally sought to hold the owner of Nutritek, Marshall Capital Holdings, Marshall Capital LLC and the alleged controller, Konstantin Malofeev all jointly liable because of their control of Nutritek. VTB Capital was {{a subsidiary of the}} Russian state owned bank called JSC VTB Bank, but the <b>loan</b> <b>facility</b> <b>agreement</b> was expressed to be governed by English law. Russagroprom defaulted on the loan, and only $40m was recovered. VTB sought to amend to add claims that the court should pierce the veil of Russagroprom to make the defendants liable under the facility agreement.|$|E

40|$|The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) {{contains}} {{the most extensive}} verification inspection provision of any arms control agreement in history. Among its innovations are provisions for <b>facility</b> <b>agreements</b> to govern on-site verification inspections of certain <b>facilities.</b> A <b>facility</b> <b>agreement</b> is an agreement or arrangement between a State Party and the Organization [for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] relating to a specific facility subject to on-site verification pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 6. The purpose of this very brief paper is to discuss the value of specificity in the model <b>facility</b> <b>agreements</b> that are {{to serve as the}} basis for <b>facility</b> <b>agreements.</b> The views expressed herein are those of the author alone, and not necessarily those of the government of the US of America or any other institution. The model <b>facility</b> <b>agreements</b> are a key document to national implementation of the CWC. As explained in the Manual for National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, <b>facility</b> <b>agreements</b> are among the important protections the CWC provides for confidential business information at facilities subject to CWC inspections. Thus, the structure of the models for these agreements will fundamentally determine how national implementation of the Convention will affect various private firms.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade {{non-bank}} institutional investors are increasingly taking larger roles in the corporate lending than they historically have played. These non-bank institutional lenders typically have higher required rates of return than banks, but invest in the same <b>loan</b> <b>facilities.</b> In a sample of 20, 031 leveraged <b>loan</b> <b>facilities</b> originated between 1997 and 2007, facilities including a non-bank institution in their syndicates have higher spreads than otherwise identical bank-only facilities. Contrary to risk-based explanations of this finding, non-bank facilities are priced with premia relative to bank-only facilities in the same loan package. These non-bank premia are substantially larger when a hedge or private equity fund {{is one of the}} syndicate members. Consistent with the notion that firms are willing to pay a premium when <b>loan</b> <b>facilities</b> are particularly important to them, the non-bank premia are larger when borrowing firms face financial constraints and when capital is less available from banks...|$|R
