40|$|SUMMARY The traffic {{congestion}} problem {{in urban areas}} is worsening since traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems cannot provide] efficient traffic regulation. Therefore, dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) recently has received increasing attention. This study devised a multi-agent architecture, the Adaptive and Cooperative Traffic light Agent Model (ACTAM), for a decentralized <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> system. The proposed architecture comprises a data storage and communication layer, a traffic regulation factor processing layer, and a decision-making layer. This study focused on utilizing the cooperation of multi-agents and the prediction mechanism of our architecture, the Forecast Module, to forecast future traffic volume in each individual intersection. The Forecast Module is designed to forecast traffic volume in an intersection via multi-agent cooperation by exchanging traffic volume information for adjacent intersections, since vehicles passing through nearby intersections were believed to significantly influence the traffic volume of specific intersections. The proposed architecture can achieve dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, total delay time of the traffic network under ACTAM can be reduced by 37 % compared to the conventional fixed sequence <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> strategy. Consequently, <b>traffic</b> congestion in urban areas can be alleviated by adopting ACTAM. key words: intelligent agents, multi-agent systems (MAS), decentralized <b>control,</b> dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> 1...|$|R

This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> models, where each agent in the system is a local <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> problems in a distributed manner.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 With over 300, 000 <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> in the United States, it is {{important}} to everyone that those <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> operate optimally. Unfortunately, according to the Institute of Transportation Engineers over 75 % of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems are in need of retiming or upgrade. Agencies and practitioners responsible for these signals face significant budgeting and procedural challenges to maintain and upgrade their systems. Transportation professionals have traditionally lacked accessible and effective tools to identify when and where the greatest benefits may be generated through retiming and system feature selection. They have also lacked methods and tools to identify, select and defend choices of new <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems. This is especially true for adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems which are generally more expensive and whose adaptive algorithms are proprietary, invalidating many traditional analysis methods. To address these challenges, a new theoretical framework including queuing and <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> models has been developed in this study to predict the impacts of <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> technology on a given corridor. This framework has been implemented in the STAR Lab Toolkit for Analysis of Traffic and Intersection Control Systems (STATICS) that uses an underlying queuing model interacting with simulated <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> logic to develop traffic measures of effectiveness under different <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> strategies and settings. The STATICS toolkit has been employed by the Oregon Department of Transportation and several other transportation agencies to analyze their corridors and select advanced <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems. Furthermore, a new cost-effective adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> system called the Swarm-Intelligence Based Adaptive Signal System (SIBASS) is proposed to address situations where optimum optimization strategies change with traffic conditions. Compared to the existing adaptive <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems, SIBASS carries an important advantage that makes it robust under communication difficulties. It operates at the individual intersection level in a flat hierarchy that does not use a central controller. Instead, each intersection self-assigns a role based on current traffic conditions and the current roles of neighboring intersections. Each role uses different optimization goals, allowing SIBASS to change intersection optimization criteria based on the current role chosen by that intersection. By designing cooperative features into SIBASS it is possible to create corridor coordination and optimization. This is accomplished using the characteristics of the swarm rather than external imposition to create order. SIBASS is evaluated via simulation under varied traffic conditions. SIBASS consistently outperformed the existing systems tested in this study. On average, SIBASS reduced system average per vehicle delay by approximately 3. 5 seconds and system average queue lengths by 20 feet in the tested scenarios. New approaches to tailoring <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> optimization strategies to current traffic conditions and desired operational goals are enabled by SIBASS. Combined, STATICS and SIBASS offer a solid basis upon which to build future tools and methods to analyze <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems. Future STATICS analytical modules may include estimating environmental performance and costs as well as improvements to pedestrian modeling and mobility analysis. Environmental and pedestrian considerations also present opportunities for improvement of SIBASS. New optimization roles can be created for SIBASS to address environmental and pedestrian optimization issues...|$|R

Most of the governments in developed countries continue to improve the safety as well as efficiency of their <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems. In a well-designed traffic control system, fewer traffic accidents will occur. Moreover, the vehicle waiting times can also be shortened. In this thesis, we attempt to apply adaptive learning techniques to <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control.</b> In particular, emphasis is put on three important aspects: (a) Adaptation: The controller should adapt its signal time plan to varying traffic patterns that are characteristic of non-stationary stochastic environments. (b) Memorization: The controller should be capable of remembering previously encountered traffic patterns so that {{there is no need to}} re-learn the patterns when these situations are encountered again. (c) Cooperation: Controllers for different traffic junctions should interact and cooperate with each other to optimize global performance. Several control strategies are studied in the thesis. First, the regular time method is a non-adaptive method that serves as a baseline for comparison with other methods. An adaptive extension of the regular time method, called the adaptive regular time method, improves performance through its adaptiveness to traffic changes. This adaptive method is then further generalised by formulating the adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> problem as a reinforcement learning problem.

For <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> already several network systems existed, but so far the integration with {{route guidance}} is lacking. In this paper we describe a new strategy to integrate <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> and route guidance, based on the principles of back-pressure control. The algorithms developed are tested in a theoretical network and it was shown that <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> based on back-pressure control performs well. Using back-pressure for route guidance required some assumptions which are open for debate. The results show that the average density is not such a good measure for route pressure and that travel time as a pressure variable performs better. A combination of factors of pressure based on density and travel time seems to be the best choice. Using back-pressure for both <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> and route guidance gave promising results, although the differences with optimized local control were small. Future research is recommended on the fine-tuning of the back-pressure <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> model, and on further integration and coordination of the control strategies. On the part of route guidance, finding representative route pressure values and making the model applicable of larger networks requires more research...|$|R

Real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> {{is an integral}} part of the urban traffic control system and providing effective real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. The developed “intelligent ” system makes “real-time ” decisions as to whether to extend green time for a set of signals. The model is developed using genetic algorithm implemented in MATLAB. A traffic emulator is developed in JAVA to represent dynamic traffic conditions. The emulator conducts surveillance after fixed interval of time and sends the data to genetic algorithm, which then provides optimum green time extensions and optimizes signal timings in real time. The optimization parameters are- total number of vehicles in a road and importance of the road in the intersection. In the end, by comparing the experimental result obtained by the fixed time and real time based traffic systems which improves significant performance for intersections, we confirmed the efficiency of our intelligent real time based control system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} {{presents}} the {{discussion on the}} concept of extending the logic of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> algorithms at the road intersections with additional decision making criteria. Currently typical <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> logic at an signalised intersection is usually based on the measurements of the cross-section characteristics of traffic at detector on intersection approach or in a broader case over the approach area of the controlled object. The traffic control criteria are therefore only partial descriptive characteristics of the traffic. These authors point out the existing problem of the balancing of supply and demand for the usage of a road network, in the context of traffic organisation and management. A modification of theF. V. Webster's formula has been presented as an example of an application of the proposed control logic. In alignment with the contemporary policy of the sustainable development of the transportation this problem has been complemented with the discussion on influencing the modal split. The presented extended logic of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> at the intersections is therefore predestined to utilise optimally both the spatial potential of road networks (their capacity) as well as their modal split...|$|R
