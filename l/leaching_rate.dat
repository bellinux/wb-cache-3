5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the <b>leaching</b> <b>rate</b> of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E

40|$|Activated metal is {{a special}} waste that {{requires}} evaluation for disposal. Contaminants in the activated metal will leach more slowly than will contaminants in generic waste. There is an inventory of activated scrap metal in the 105 -L Disassembly Basin. Approximately 1, 600 ft 3 of the material is characterized as ''No Dose/Low Dose'' and consists mainly of activated aluminum and aluminum alloy pieces and parts and no stainless steel with a dose rate less than 200 mR per hr. Contaminants in the activated metal will leach more slowly than will contaminants in generic waste. The change in the <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> will affect analyses for the groundwater pathway and intruder scenarios. For this evaluation, the slower <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> from the activated metal waste will be neglected for the groundwater pathway, which is conservative because the higher <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> used tends to produce higher groundwater concentrations and lower inventory limits. For this evaluation, the <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> was set to zero for intruder scenarios, which is conservative for the inadvertent intruder because a slower <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> will result in higher levels of radionuclides in the waste zone.

40|$|AbstractThis report {{reviews the}} {{possible}} effects of both radiation {{damage to the}} glass and of radiolysis of the leachant on the leaching behaviour of vitrified radioactive waste. It has been stimulated particularly by recent papers, which {{have suggested that the}} <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> of glasses will be enhanced by large factors after a ‘critical’ dose of radiation from alpha decays. These experiments have been conducted at highly accelerated rates using ion beams. The relationship between these experiments and the situation in vitrified waste has been assessed, taking into account the fact that experiments using alpha emitters incorporated in the glass have failed to find significantly enhanced <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> after doses about five times larger than those equivalent to this ‘critical’ dose. It is concluded that these differences are observed partly because the ion beam experiments are carried out at such high dose rates that some recovery effects important at lower rates do not come into play. In the case of experiments with 2 keV argon ions, surface effects other than genuine radiation damage must be taken into account. In practice, if water has penetrated the canister, vitrified waste will be irradiated {{in the presence of the}} leaching solution. Enhancements of the <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> due to the transient effects of radiation in the solid are shown to be completely negligible. The effects of radiolysis of the leaching solution and of any air in contact with the solution have also been considered in some detail and related to recent experiments by McVay and Pederson. It is shown that these radiolysis effects will not lead to any situations requiring special precautions in practice, although changes in surface <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> by small factors can be expected under some circumstances. Any effect of irradiation on <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> must be seen in the context of a waste repository. Along with other studies we hold the view that the rate of loss of material will be limited by the access of water to the repository, and will therefore depend on the effective saturation solubility of the glass in the leachant, not on the <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> as usually determined in laboratory tests. Radiation damage is not expected to change the saturation solubility by more than a factor of two or three...|$|R

In this paper, the sensitivity Of MAKEDEP to various amounts and timing of N availability, including increased supplies of N prior to air pollution assuming increased biological N- 2 fixation, was assessed in a small hardwood stand of southern Quebec. The scenarios of N cycling were validated for burned and unburned conditions based on the simulated tree growth and N <b>leaching</b> <b>rates</b> {{as well as the}} model's ability to recreate the trends in atmospheric deposition of major ions in northeastern North America. The N <b>leaching</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated as the residual component of all simulated processes acting as sources and sinks of N. The N availability scenarios that subtracted/added 5 mmol m(- 2) yr(- 1) of NH 4 in the unburned and burned conditions, respectively, recreated N <b>leaching</b> <b>rates</b> and tree biomass with the most precision. Modifying the amounts of N made available prior to air pollution was also necessary for the trees to grow to reasonable values before 1900. Historical trends of deposition were linked to the changes in the continental emissions in northeastern North America. Observational data for 30 years at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, showed convergent trends for most ions with the deposition trends simulated with MAKEDEP...|$|R
40|$|This memo {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} of some recent measurements of solution impurity levels in the three KDP and one DKDP Pilot Production 1000 liter growth tanks (Tanks B, C, D, & F). Solution samples were taken {{on a weekly basis}} during recent crystal growth runs in each tank and were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES). The solution history for five specific elements, Si, B, Al, Fe and Ca will be analyzed in detail. The first four of these elements are input into solution via slow dissolution of the glass vessel at a rate which is strongly dependent on the solution temperature. Si and B continuously accumulate in solution, since they are not incorporated into the crystal. Al and Fe by comparison are incorporated into the crystal (primarily the prismatic sectors) and present problems to inclusion-free growth (Al) and 30 damage (Fe). The level of these impurities initially increases when the crystal size is small but later decreases when the rate of incorporation into the crystal exceeds the rate of dissolution of the glass tank. The last element, Ca is of interest since it has recently been observed {{to be one of the}} elements found at the location of 3 cu damage. For Si and B, the dissolution or <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> from the glass tank is easily obtained from the results of the chemical analysis. The temperature dependent <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> are shown to be comparable (within a factor of two) for all four tanks, with Tank B (DKDP) having the lowest rate of Si accumulation. The glass <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> of the two incorporating elements Al and Fe require substantially more analysis as the daily variation of the crystal dimensions, the solution concentration, and the mass of KDP remaining in solution must be taken into account in order to separate the rate of impurity incorporation from the rate of dissolution of the glass. The method for accomplishing this separation is described, and the result obtained is that the <b>leach</b> <b>rates</b> of all four tanks are within a factor of three of each other. Tank B again shows the lowest <b>leach</b> <b>rate</b> for both Al and Fe. The results for Ca are less clear. From the present data, the level of Ca does not change appreciably during a run, indicating that it. is neither leaching from the glass strongly nor being incorporated into the crystal at a significant rate. It does increase with the age of the solution, however, as Ca is a small but measurable component of both the starting salt as well as the D,O. Older solutions that have successfully grown several crystals will therefore have higher accumulated levels of Ca, which will increase the driving force for Ca incorporation into the crystal...|$|R
