40|$|Abstract—The need {{of sharing}} {{fingerprint}} image data in many emerg-ing applications raises concerns about the protection of privacy. It has become possible to use automated algorithms for inferring soft biometrics from fingerprint images. Even if we cannot uniquely match the person to an existing fingerprint, revealing their age or gender may lead to undesirable consequences. Our research is focused on de-identifying fingerprint images in order to obfuscate soft biometrics. In this paper, we first discuss a general framework for soft biometrics fingerprint de-identification. We implemented the framework {{to reduce the risk}} of successful estimation of gender from fingerprint images using ad-hoc image filtering. We evaluate the proposed approach through experiments using a data set <b>of</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprints</b> collected at West Virginia University. Results show the proposed method is effective in preventing gender estimation from fingerprint images...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Law {{enforcement}} agencies routinely collect both <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> <b>of</b> all the ten fingers of suspects. These {{two types of}} fingerprints complement each other, since <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprints</b> are <b>of</b> larger size and contain more minutiae, and plain fingerprints are less affected by distortion and have clearer ridge structure. It is widely known in the law enforcement community that searching both <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> can improve the accuracy of latent matching, but, this {{does not appear to}} be a common practice in law enforcement. To our knowledge, only rank level fusion option is provided by the vendors. There has been no systematic study and comparison of different fusion techniques. In this paper, multiple fusion approaches at three different levels (rank, score and feature) are proposed to fuse <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints.</b> Experimental results in searching 230 latents in the ELFT-EFS Public Challenge Dataset against a database of 4, 180 pairs <b>of</b> <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> show that most of the fusion approaches can improve the identification performance. The greatest improvement was obtained by boosted max fusion at the score level, which reaches a rank- 1 identification rate of 83. 0 %, compared to the rank- 1 rate of 57. 8 % for plain and 70. 4 % for rolled prints...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{fingerprint}} matching {{studies have been}} conducted on an experimental laboratory system called the Algorithmic Test Bed (ATB). The ATB is a system used to test the functional characteristics of the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) component of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). It was supplied by Lockheed Martin a, the vendor of IAFIS, whose technology it shares. The ATB includes a built-in gallery of nearly 1. 2 M subjects, effectively a 3 % representative sample of the FBI’s criminal master file, with some room for additions. The ATB provides broad control over its operating modes and set points. The ATB, like IAFIS, was originally designed to identify (and verify) subjects using submitted (predominantly <b>rolled)</b> <b>fingerprint</b> cards. The database against which the submitted cards were to be matched was likewise predominantly composed <b>of</b> <b>rolled</b> images from <b>fingerprint</b> cards. As demand rose for the use of plain (or flat or slap) images, ascertaining the operational characteristics of this matcher with plain submissions became important. These studies were organized in three major groups. Studies of plain-to-rolled matching as a function of data source made up the first group. Studies of plain-to-rolled matching using large sets of operational data made up the second. Studies of plain-to-plain matching made up the third. The studies answered nine major questions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExisting {{algorithms}} that fuse level- 2 and level- 3 fingerprint match scores {{perform well}} {{when the number}} of features are adequate and the quality of images are acceptable. In practice, fingerprints collected under unconstrained environment neither guarantee the requisite image quality nor the minimum number of features required. This paper presents a novel fusion algorithm that combines fingerprint match scores to provide high accuracy under non-ideal conditions. The match scores obtained from level- 2 and level- 3 classifiers are first augmented with a quality score that is quantitatively determined by applying redundant discrete wavelet transform to a fingerprint image. We next apply the generalized belief functions of Dezert–Smarandache theory to effectively fuse the quality-augmented match scores obtained from level- 2 and level- 3 classifiers. Unlike statistical and learning based fusion techniques, the proposed plausible and paradoxical reasoning approach effectively mitigates conflicting decisions obtained from classifiers especially when the evidences are imprecise due to poor image quality or limited fingerprint features. The proposed quality-augmented fusion algorithm is validated using a comprehensive database which comprises <b>of</b> <b>rolled</b> and partial <b>fingerprint</b> images of varying quality with arbitrary number of features. The performance is compared with existing fusion approaches for different challenging realistic scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Fingerprint based {{identification}} {{is one of}} the most mature and proven technique compare to the all biometric technique. In crime sense fingerprints have been extensively used for identification of criminals. Fingerprints are classified as rolled, plain and latent fingerprints. Latent fingerprints are lifted from surface of objects that are unintentionally touched by person. Latent means poor quality of images or unclear image i. e. smudgy, blurred, moist, small area or fingerprints that contains fewer amount of minutiae. Matching latent <b>fingerprints</b> over <b>rolled</b> or plain <b>fingerprints</b> that is difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to extract all fingerprint features that are present in latent fingerprint images for accurate matching. Although tremendous progress has been made AFIS (Auto-mated Fingerprint Identification System), this system works well only in that case where <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprint</b> images. There-fore, semi-automatic system is feasible for feature extraction of la-tent images i. e. some human intervention is allowed during feature extraction from latent fingerprint images. Before feature ex-traction performed it is necessary to improve the quality of la-tent image because they are lifted from any surface and it is easy to extract features from improved quality of latent images. Then outputs candidates are matched over <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprint</b> images by using fully automatic system. This paper presents study of various techniques that are useful for latent fingerprint matching...|$|R

They {{are now being}} considered for inclusion in automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS), particularly with the adoption of 1000 ppi resolution in the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system. Earlier studies on this topic suffered from two limitations: (i) experiments were based on live scan images that are generally of good quality and contain smaller intra-class variations compared to ink images and (ii) the baseline minutiae matcher {{used to measure the}} additive value of extended features was not a state-of-the-art matcher. In this paper, we study the utility of pores, one of the most prevalent extended <b>fingerprint</b> features, on <b>rolled</b> ink <b>fingerprint</b> images at both 500 ppi and 1000 ppi resolution in the NIST SD 30 database. The results show that the fingerprint image quality significantly affects the automatic extraction and matching accuracy of pores. Furthermore, the contribution of pores to the overall fingerprint recognition accuracy is miniscule when a COTS matcher is used for 500 ppi <b>rolled</b> ink <b>fingerprint</b> images. The fusion between pore matcher and COTS minutiae matcher is a bit more effective on 1000 ppi good quality <b>rolled</b> ink <b>fingerprint</b> images.

40|$|Identifying {{suspects}} {{based on}} impressions of fingers lifted from crime scenes (latent prints) {{is extremely important}} to law enforcement agencies. Latents are usually partial fingerprints with small area, contain nonlinear distortion, and are usually smudgy and blurred. Due {{to some of these}} characteristics, they have a significantly smaller number of minutiae points (one of the most important features in fingerprint matching) and therefore it can be extremely difficult to automatically match latents to plain or <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprints</b> that are stored in law enforcement databases. Our goal is to develop a latent matching algorithm that uses only minutiae information. The proposed approach consists of following three modules: (i) align two sets of minutiae by using a descriptor-based Hough Transform; (ii) establish the correspondences between minutiae; and (iii) compute a similarity score. Experimental results on NIST SD 27 show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a commercial fingerprint matcher. 1...|$|R
40|$|Fingerprints are {{traditionally}} captured based on contact of the finger on paper or a platen surface.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{availability}} <b>of</b> <b>live-scan</b> palmprint technology, high resolution palmprint recognition {{has started to}} receive significant attention in forensics and law enforcement. In forensic applications, latent palmprints provide critical evidence as {{it is estimated that}} about 30 percent of the latents recovered at crime scenes are those of palms. Most of the available high resolution palmprint matching algorithms essentially follow the minutiae-based fingerprint matching strategy. Considering the large number of minutiae (about 1, 000 minutiae in a full palmprint compared to about 100 minutiae in a <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprint)</b> and large area of foreground region in full palmprints, novel strategies need to be developed for efficient and robust latent palmprint matching. In this paper, a coarse to fine matching strategy based on minutiae clustering and minutiae match propagation is designed specifically for palmprint matching. To deal with the large number of minutiae, a local feature based minutiae clustering algorithm is designed to cluster minutiae into several groups such that minutiae belonging to the same group have similar local characteristics. The coarse matching is then performed within each cluster to establish initial minutiae correspondences between two palmprints. Starting with each initial correspondence, a minutiae match propagation algorithm searches for mated minutiae in the full palmprint. The proposed palmprint matching algorithm has been evaluated on a latent-to-full palmprint database consisting of 446 latents and 12, 489 background full prints. The matching results show a rank- 1 identification accuracy of 79. 4 %, which is significantly higher than the 60. 8 % identification accuracy of a state of the art latent palmprint matching algorithm on the same latent database. The average computation time of our algorithm for a single latent-to-full match is about 141 ms for genuine match and 50 ms for impostor match, on a Windows XP desktop system with 2. 2 GHz CPU and 1. 00 GB RAM. The computation time of our algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than a previously published state of the art algorithm.
