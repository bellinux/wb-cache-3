25|$|In Northern Ireland, {{phosphorus}} enrichment {{of lakes}} due to agriculture {{is a significant}} problem. Locally available laterite—a low-grade bauxite rich in iron and aluminium—is used in acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at several sewage treatment facilities. Calcium-, iron- and aluminium-rich solid media are recommended for phosphorus removal. A study, using both laboratory tests and pilot-scale constructed wetlands, reports the effectiveness of granular laterite in removing phosphorus and heavy metals from <b>landfill</b> <b>leachate.</b> Initial laboratory studies show that laterite is capable of 99% removal of phosphorus from solution. A pilot-scale experimental facility containing laterite achieved 96% removal of phosphorus. This removal is greater than reported in other systems. Initial removals of aluminium and iron by pilot-scale facilities have been up to 85% and 98% respectively. Percolating columns of laterite removed enough cadmium, chromium and lead to undetectable concentrations. There is a possible application of this low-cost, low-technology, visually unobtrusive, efficient system for rural areas with dispersed point sources of pollution.|$|E

40|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>leachates</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} as significant secondary sources of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). This study presents data on the occurrence and concentration of 11 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and 5 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) in leachates from 4 municipal solid waste landfill sites located across northern Spain. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of PFASs in Spanish <b>landfill</b> <b>leachates.</b> Two of the landfill sites applied on-site treatment using membrane bioreactors (MBR), and its effect on PFASs occurrence is also reported. Total PFASs (∑PFASs) in raw leachates reached 1378. 9 ng/L, while in treated samples ∑PFASs was approximately two-fold (3162. 3 ng/L). PFCAs accounted {{for the majority of the}} detected PFASs and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant compound in raw leachates (42. 6 %), followed by shorter chain PFHxA (30. 1 %), PFPeA and PFBA. The age of the sites might explain the PFASs pattern found in raw leachates as all of them were stabilized leachates. However, PFASs profile was different in treated samples where the most abundant compound was PFHxA (26. 5 %), followed by linear perfluorobutane sulfonate (L-PFBS) (18. 7 %) and PFOA (17. 7 %). The overall increase of the PFASs content as well as the change in the PFASs profile after the MBR treatment, could be explained by the possible degradation of PFASs precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols or fluorotelomer sulfonates. Using the volume of leachates generated in the landfill sites, that served 1. 8 million people, the discharge of 16 ∑PFASs contained in the <b>landfill</b> <b>leachates</b> was estimated as 1209 g/year.

40|$|A simple {{operative}} {{procedure is}} described for the speciation of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Ni and Cd) in <b>landfill</b> <b>leachates.</b> The procedure {{is based on}} the kinetics of metal removal from the liquid phase by a cation-chelating resin (Chelex- 100) in batch tests. The metals were divided in three different classes of behaviour (free-labile fraction, slowly exchangeable fraction and stable-inert fraction). The leachate was spiked with the metals at mg L(- 1) level and a strong effect of the aging time (the time elapsed between metal spike of the leachate and kinetic tests) was observed. This is to be ascribed to a slow complex formation in the spiked leachate. As a comparison, the procedure was also applied on synthetic solutions containing several simple ligands (chloride, acetate, glycinate and salycilate), proposed in the literature to model the complexing power of <b>landfill</b> <b>leachates.</b> The metals in the leachate behaved in a different way than in the synthetic solutions. The metal removal rate was in general slower than observed in the synthetic solutions and a not negligible stable/inert fraction was always present for each of the metals.
