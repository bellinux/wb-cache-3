2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with roller blind focal plane shutter, gearbox, film magazine, and <b>lens</b> <b>cone.</b> Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide roll film, with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film). Shutter speed is preset between 1/100s and 1/1000s.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe focal cone {{electroretinogram}} (ERG) in monkey retina {{has been}} examined with a 3 deg pulse of laser light (544 and 633 nm) {{centered on a}} 25 deg steady white rod saturating field. The stimuli were viewed simultaneously through a slit lamp and corneal contact <b>lens.</b> <b>Cone</b> ERGS were studied at different eccentricities from the fovea and compared with full-field corneal and intraretinal ERGS. The cone ERG is maximum at the fovea. There are two components to the on- (b-wave) and off-(d-wave) response, one slower, more long wavelength sensitive and more foveally oriented than the faster response. This makes the foveal cone ERG slower and more longer wavelength sensitive than the perifoveal ERG. This difference disappears at high rates (> 20 Hz) of stimulation. The foveal cone ERG is larger and slower than that of more peripheral retina. The slowness appears {{to be due to}} a subcomponent of the response which is especially prominent in the fovea and has a slightly greater long wavelength sensitivity than the more peripherally generated ERG. It may depend on a unique difference in L-M cone bipolar systems or in L-M cone interactions that are more prominent near the fovea...|$|E

40|$|F 2 -lasers {{with their}} vacuum-ultraviolet {{emission}} wavelength of 157 nm offer {{the possibility to}} process UV-transparent materials like quartz or fused silica by direct laser ablation. This way optical quartz fiber tips can be modified {{in a way that}} special beam characteristics of the fiber-emitted light are generated, i. e. the beam shaping optic is integrated into the fiber. Two ablation methods for this modification of fiber tips have been developed, lateral processing and axial processing. Both are based on mask projection in combination with a rotation of the fiber. Precise shaping of the tip with surface roughness around 30 nm is obtained. Examples of these fiber integrated optics are <b>lenses,</b> <b>cones</b> or inverted cones. These functional fiber tips can be applied in medical technology or metrol-ogy...|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and experimental results for {{two types of}} space application concentrator photovoltaic modules, employing reflective optical elements, are presented. The first type {{is based on the}} use of compound parabolic concentrators, the second type is based on the use of line-focus parabolic troughs.

40|$|With eight islands, complex coastlines {{and bottom}} topography, strong wind curls, and {{frequent}} upwelling fronts, the Southern California Bight (SCB) {{is an area}} with strong eddy activity. By applying an automated eddy detection scheme to a 12 year high-resolution numerical product of the oceanic circulation in the SCB, a three-dimensional eddy data set is developed. It includes information for each eddy's location, polarity, intensity, size, boundary, and moving path at nine vertical levels. Through a series of statistical analyses applied to the eddy data set, three-dimensional statistical characteristics of mesoscale and submeoscale eddy variations in the SCB are elucidated; these shed light on how eddies are generated, evolve, and terminate. A significant percentage of eddies {{is found to be}} generated around islands and headlands along the coastline, which indicates that islands in the SCB {{play a vital role in}} eddy generation. Three types of eddies, based on shape, are identified from the numerical product: bowl, <b>lens,</b> and <b>cone.</b> A dynamic analysis shows that some submesoscale eddies with finite local Rossby numbers tend to be ageostrophic balanced while mesoscale eddies are in geostrophic balance.

40|$|Among {{the curious}} eyes {{found in nature}} {{is that of a}} little known marine {{crustacean}}, Copilia, a copepod, which is about X 1 X 3 mm. This copepod is found in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. In 1963, while we were working on crustacean eyes at the Zoological Research Station, Naples, Italy, Professor J. Z. Young brought to our attention this animal and its unusual eyes. Only the female of the species possesses these remarkable eyes which make up more than half of its transparent body. The eye of Copilia (Mediterranean) was described in 1879 by Grenacher (6) and in 1891 by Exner (1) who made measurements of its optical system. Recently Vaissire (8, 9) and Gregory (3, 4) and his collaborators (5) have made studies of the eye and the behavior of Copilia. Each eye appears as the single ommatidium of a compound eye (sometimes referred to as ocelli in copepods) with a corneal <b>lens,</b> crystalline <b>cone,</b> and retinula cells that form its rhabdom (Figs. 1 and 4). The rhabdom lies in a pigmented stem that oscillates back and forth (Fig. 4). It seemed important {{to learn more about the}} optics and imaging properties of such scanning eyes and also to see by electron microscopy how the rhabdom and its rhabdomeres are structured in comparison to other arthropod visual systems (1...|$|R
30|$|It is {{seen that}} in all cases, the energy levels are very {{sensitive}} to the magnetic field and their dependencies on the magnetic field strength exhibit multiple crossovers and reordering. Comparing these dependencies for the disk, the <b>lens,</b> and the <b>cone</b> in Figure[*] 2, one can also observe a successive increase of the number of crossovers and the lowering of the region energies where such crossovers occur. It is related to the variation of the electron probability distribution inside and around their InAs layers, which is similar to charge distribution in a metallic surface when its geometry varies from the flat to the spiked-type one. Such variation of the probability distribution is a consequence of the stronger confinement in structures with spiked-type QD geometry where the electron-ion separation is defined by interplays between the electrostatic interaction between them and the strong structural confinement, making it more stable with respect to the external magnetic field and the ring-like electron probability density distribution. Therefore, the energy dependencies for cone-like QDs have a shape similar to those that exhibit structures with ring-like geometry known as the Aharonov-Bohm effect.|$|R
40|$|Superposition {{eyes are}} {{generally}} thought to function ideally when {{the eye is}} spherical and with rhabdom tips in the focal plane of the imaging optics of facet <b>lenses</b> and crystalline <b>cones.</b> Anatomical data as well as direct optical measurements demonstrate that the superposition eyes of moths and skippers often deviate severely from the expected ideal case. Part of the deviation {{has been attributed to}} diffraction at the single facet lens, which was taken to be an essential limit to spatial resolution, because light traveling through different facet lenses was assumed to be incoherent. By considering the two-dimensional facet lens lattice, it is here demonstrated that many facets within a superposition aperture transmit coherent light, allowing a much sharper image than possible with single facet lens diffraction. Partial coherence therefore is an important aspect of superposition imaging. It is argued that broadening of the photoreceptor acceptance angles occurs because of optical errors in the facet lens-crystalline cone system other than diffraction. The transmittance of the superposition aperture of moths and skippers is improved by the corneal nipple arrays of the facet lenses, but quantitative assessment shows that the effect is minor. ...|$|R
40|$|JWFront is {{a program}} written in Java to visualize, {{in two or three}} dimensions, the wavefronts passing by an object, i. e. a black hole or {{gravitational}} <b>lens.</b> The light <b>cones</b> can also be displayed. The caustics for a given metric can be visualized in two or three dimensions. This program has a graphical user interface to control input and output. The implemented metrics so far are: Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kerr. We will describe how the program works and present its applications. 1. Wavefronts and Caustics in General Relativity The mathematical theory of wavefronts and caustics in general relativity were developed by Friedrich and Stewart 1 (see also Stewart 2). They used Arnold’s singularity theory 3 to tackle this problem. More recently Hasse 4 et al., Low, 5 and Ehlers and Newman 6 have revived this topic. Petters 7 (see also Petters 8 et al.), and Frittelli and Petters 9 developed this theory for gravitational lenses. More recently, Grave 10 made movies in MPG format of the gravitational collapse and wavefronts in presence of Schwarzschild and Kerr fields. To have a perspective on this topic, the interested reader is referred to Perlick’s paper. 11 1. 1. Wavefronts A wavefront is generated by a bundle of light rays orthogonal to a spacelike 2 -surface in a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold. 4 For the sake of visualization, the wavefront is defined as the surface A generated by all points of the null geodesic bundle at a given time ti: A(ti) = {γ(ti) | γ(ti) is a null geodesic with γ(t 0) = (t 0, x 0, y 0, z 0), ti ≥ t 0 }...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{essential}} {{feature of}} the superposition type of compound eye {{is the presence of}} a wide zone, which is transparent and devoid of pigment and interposed between the distal array of dioptric elements and the proximally placed photoreceptive layer. Parallel rays, collected by many lenses, must (through reflection or refraction) cross this transparent clear-zone {{in such a way that}} they become focused on one receptor. Superposition depends mostly on diameter and curvature of the cornea, size and shape of the crystalline <b>cone,</b> <b>lens</b> cylinder properties of cornea and cone, dimensions of the receptor cells, and width of the clear-zone. We examined the role of the latter by geometrical, geometric-optical, and anatomical measurements and concluded that a minimal size exists, below which effective superposition can no longer occur. For an eye of a given size, it is not possible to increase the width of the clear-zone cz=dcz/R 1 and decrease R 2 (i. e., the radius of curvature of the distal retinal surface) and/or c=dc/R 1 without reaching a limit. In the equations `cz' is the width of the clear-zone dcz relative to the radius R 1 of the eye and c is the length of the cornea-cone unit relative to R 1. Our results provide one explanation as to why apposition eyes exist in very small scarabaeid beetles, when generally the taxon Scarabaeoidea is characterized by the presence of superposition eyes. The results may also provide the answer for the puzzle why juveniles or the young of species, in which the adults possess superposition (=clear-zone) eyes, frequently bear eyes that do not contain a clear zone, but resemble apposition eyes. The eyes of the young and immature specimens may simply be too small to permit superposition to occur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{determine}} the effect of varying lens diameter of two types of keratoconic lenses on lens performance and initial comfort with participants with either centered or oval cones. MethodsSixteen eyes of ten keratoconic participants were fitted with lenses of five diameters i. e. 8. 7, 9, 9. 6, 10. 1 and 10. 4 diameters and two commercially available lens types; “KCGP- 1 ” and “KCGP- 2 ”. Lensmovement, centration and initial comfort were assessed. ResultsTen subjects (2 female and 8 male, sixteen eyes) were enrolled to participate in the pilot study, themean age was 40. 4 ± 14. 33 years. Six eyes were in the early centred cone group, five in the early oval cone group and five in the late oval <b>cone</b> group. The <b>lenses</b> with the 9. 6 lens diameter (TD) decentered the least for all lenses (p= 0. 001). When compared to cone type, the 8. 7 / 9 were more decentered for the late oval and late centred cones (p= 0. 009). The movement of the smaller KCGP- 1 was greater than the KCGP- 2 for the centered early cones (p= 0. 001) and the movement decreased for the larger KCGP- 2 <b>lenses</b> for all <b>cone</b> types but not significantly (p> 0. 05). The KCGP- 1 lenses were more significantly comfortable than the KCGP- 2 lenses for the centered cones (p= 0. 003). Only for the early oval cones, was the larger KCGP- 2 lenses more comfortable (p= 0. 04). ConclusionsLens diameter affects comfort and centration especially for the small (8. 7 / 9) and large (10. 4 / 10. 1) diameters in this pilot study. Lens movement was not correlated with comfort...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Compensatory {{responses}} to focusing errors imposed by spectacle lenses in chicks, tree shrews and primates leave {{little doubt that}} active emmetropization can occur, and debate is now centered on whether this process is uni-directional or bi-directional in nature. To provide further insight into this emmetropization process, the studies reported in this paper addressed {{the question of whether}} access to sharp vision is necessary for compensation to myopic defocus in the chick. METHODS: Two different experimental paradigms were used to address the above question: (A) Myopic defocus was imposed, either with + 15 or + 40 d lenses alone or with + 15 D lenses on eyes made myopic by 7 days of form deprivation; these treatments result in a shift in the plane of focus of the eye (far point) to 6. 67, 2. 5 cm and approximately 3. 5 cm resp., with only objects at or closer than these planes being in focus. The addition to the <b>lenses</b> of stand-off <b>cones,</b> either 2. 5 or 5 cm in length, further limited access to (or precluded) sharp vision by controlling how closely the chicks could approach objects. One group that had sharp vision precluded also underwent optic nerve section. (B) A range of positive lenses (+ 15 to + 65 D) were used on their own to impose myopic defocus; for the high power lenses, access to sharp vision was very restricted because of the close proximity of the new far point (1. 54 cm for + 65 D lens). Refractive errors and axial ocular dimensions were measured in all experiments. RESULTS: In the first study (A), preclusion of sharp vision not only prevented compensation but resulted in increased eye growth and myopia. This myopia, like form-deprivation myopia, was unaltered by optic nerve section surgery. Limiting but not precluding sharp vision resulted in partial compensation. In the second study (B), good compensation was observed with the + 15 D lens but compensation progressively declined for higher powers, with the + 50 D lens having no apparent effect on eye growth and refraction and the + 65 D lens inducing myopia instead of hyperopia. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results argue that some sharp vision is fundamental to compensation to impose myopia. The significance of this new finding in relation to the processes underlying active emmetropization is discussed...|$|R
