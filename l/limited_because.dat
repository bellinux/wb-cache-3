5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat <b>limited</b> <b>because</b> most of the nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States {{at the time were}} focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project. Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids.

50|$|The {{speed limit}} on most rural Interstates is 70 mph. Urban Interstate speed limits {{generally}} vary from 55 mph to 65 mph. Sections of I-64 and I-68 have lower truck speed <b>limits</b> <b>because</b> of steep grades; otherwise, West Virginia does not post separate truck speed limits.

5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was <b>limited</b> <b>because</b> they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League. He {{was one of the best}} pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food <b>limited</b> <b>because</b> benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been <b>limited</b> <b>because</b> they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

5|$|As local {{football}} {{continued to}} expand after the war, {{and with the}} success of the newly formed Yorkshire League, demand for another senior team in York arose. At a meeting held at the Co-operative Hall in York on 6 May 1922, {{the decision was made to}} form the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited, with W. H. Shaw as chairman. Despite having neither a ground nor players, an application was made for election to the Football League; this was unsuccessful, but the club was admitted to the Midland League on 10 June 1922. York's first match was away to Notts County reserves on 6 September 1922, and despite a good performance the team lost 4–2. York had to play their first two home matches at Mille Crux, the ground of Messrs Rowntree & Company <b>Limited,</b> <b>because</b> their Fulfordgate ground was not ready. Their first match at Fulfordgate came on 20 September 1922, with a 4–1 victory against Mansfield Town. York finished 1922–23 in 19th place; they had been placed midtable in early March 1923 but failed to win any of their remaining 14 fixtures. In the same year, York reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup, but lost 4–2 to Middlesbrough reserves at Ayresome Park on 10 March 1923. The club's first season proved disappointing financially, with a loss of £718 reported, and as a consequence Shaw relinquished the chairmanship to Arthur Brown. York entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1923–24 and reached the first qualifying round, losing 3–1 to Mexborough Town in a second replay. They again ranked 19th in the table with an almost identical record to the previous season's.|$|E

30|$|The TXOP {{limit values}} in Table  3 {{are written in}} a form to show the {{relativity}} of these values for different traffic types. Different combinations of numerical values were used when the proposed mechanism was simulated, but the relativity mentioned in Table  3 was maintained. Voice gets the least TXOP <b>limit</b> <b>because</b> it consists of short data bursts and long silent periods. Video gets highest TXOP limit as it has streams of packets, {{so that it could}} transmit as much of the stream as possible when the station acquires medium access. Web-browsing gets moderate TXOP <b>limit</b> <b>because</b> its traffic has bursty characteristics as well. File-sharing traffic gets a bit higher TXOP <b>limit</b> than web-browsing <b>because</b> it also has streams of packets, but has less priority than video traffic as file-sharing traffic is elastic (non-real-time) in nature.|$|R

5000|$|Coronal mass ejections reach {{velocities}} from [...] with {{an average}} speed of , based on SOHO/LASCO measurements between 1996 and 2003. These speeds correspond to transit times from the Sun out to the mean radius of Earth's orbit of about 13 hours to 86 days (extremes), with about 3.5 days as the average. The average mass ejected is 1.6e12 kg. However, the estimated mass values for CMEs are only lower <b>limits,</b> <b>because</b> coronagraph measurements provide only two-dimensional data. The frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the solar cycle: from about one every fifth day near the solar minimum to 3.5 per day near the solar maximum. These values are also lower <b>limits</b> <b>because</b> ejections propagating away from Earth (backside CMEs) usually cannot be detected by coronagraphs.|$|R
