5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve endings at the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Like Eliurus, Voalavo has {{moderately}} high-crowned (hypsodont) molars with crowns that consist not {{of discrete}} cusps, but of transverse laminae (plates) that generally lack longitudinal connections. However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in Voalavo, and the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molar has only two laminae (three in Eliurus). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.|$|E
5|$|Musicians often socialised in the Gioconda café at No. 9. David Bowie {{recruited}} {{his first}} backing band, The <b>Lower</b> <b>Third,</b> in the bar, while the Small Faces formed {{after the original}} members socialised at the Gioconda.

5000|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>thirds</b> {{are also}} often known as [...] "CG" [...] (from {{character}} generator) or captions, and sometimes chyrons in North America, {{due to the}} popularity of Chyron Corporation's Chiron I character generator, an early digital solution developed in the 1970s for rendering <b>lower</b> <b>thirds.</b> [...] Other common terms include superbars (or simply supers) (US), name straps and astons (after Aston Broadcast Systems) (UK).|$|R
5|$|Known {{material}} of Dermotherium includes {{a handful of}} jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred {{material of}} this species from Pakistan includes a single M2.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the <b>lower</b> <b>third)</b> contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E

5|$|Out of the {{hundreds}} of known Psittacosaurus specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis {{due to a lack of}} blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molar—are closed by a wall, or cingulum, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E

25|$|It is {{rare for}} pericoronitis {{to occur in}} {{association}} with both <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molars at the same time, {{despite the fact that}} many young people will have both lower wisdom teeth partially erupted. Therefore, bilateral pain from the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molar region is unlikely to be caused by pericoronitis and more likely to be muscular in origin.|$|E
25|$|Supporting {{the vagina}} are its upper third, middle third and <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> muscles and ligaments. The upper third are the levator ani muscles (transcervical, pubocervical) and the sacrocervical ligaments; {{these areas are}} also {{described}} as the cardinal ligaments laterally and uterosacral ligaments posterolaterally. The middle third of the vagina concerns the urogenital diaphragm (also described as the paracolpos and pelvic diaphragm). The <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> is the perineal body; it may be described as containing the perineal body, pelvic diaphragm and urogenital diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|Its <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> {{presents}} a broader, somewhat triangular surface, the Inferior {{angle of the}} scapula, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus dorsi glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from this part.|$|E

2500|$|Another [...] "accented" [...] {{chromatic}} chord {{frequently used}} by march music composers is an inversion of a I chord with a <b>lowered</b> <b>third</b> and raised fifth. For example, {{if there was}} an E♭ major chord (the I in the key of E♭), it would be followed by a B major chord (because a B chord is an E♭ chord with a <b>lowered</b> <b>third</b> and raised fifth). Unlike the aforementioned secondary dominants, this chord really does not have logical harmonic functions to it (besides neighbor tone usage) other than to add texture and interest.|$|R
25|$|Ramus {{fractures}} {{are said}} to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an oblique line extending from the <b>lower</b> <b>third</b> molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and {{which could not be}} better classified as either condylar or coronoid fractures.|$|E
25|$|The longer {{people are}} missing teeth, wear {{dentures}} or partials, the less bone {{they have in}} their jaws.

25|$|When the SDFT is damaged, {{there is}} a {{thickening}} of the tendon, giving it a bowed appearance when the leg is viewed from the side.

25|$|The {{angle of}} the {{mandible}} refers to the angle created by {{the arrangement of the}} body of the mandible and the ramus.
