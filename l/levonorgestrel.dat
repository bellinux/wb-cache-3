5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control <b>levonorgestrel</b> around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levonorgestrel</b> intrauterine {{devices are}} highly {{effective}} in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically very moderate because the <b>levonorgestrel</b> (a progestin) is released in low concentration locally. There is now substantial evidence that Levongestrel-IUDs provide good symptomatic relief {{for women with}} fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{estrogen}} (ethinylestradiol) and progestin (<b>levonorgestrel</b> or norgestrel) pills used to {{be available}} as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills under several brand names: Schering PC4, Tetragynon, Neoprimavlar, and Preven (in the United States) but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (<b>levonorgestrel)</b> emergency contraceptive pills with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (<b>levonorgestrel,</b> ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral contraceptive pills can be taken in split doses 12hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72hours after intercourse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills containing <b>levonorgestrel</b> or norgestrel available in the United States {{that can be used}} in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levonorgestrel</b> intrauterine {{devices are}} {{effective}} in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically few as the <b>levonorgestrel</b> (a progestin) is released in low concentration locally. While most levongestrel-IUD studies concentrated on treatment of women without fibroids a few reported good results specifically for women with fibroids including a substantial regression of fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Ulipristal acetate, and mid-dose {{mifepristone}} is {{more effective}} than <b>levonorgestrel,</b> which {{is more effective}} than the Yupse method.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levonorgestrel</b> intrauterine {{devices are}} highly {{effective}} at controlling {{dysfunctional uterine bleeding}} (DUB) or menorrhagia and should be considered before any surgery.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), <b>levonorgestrel,</b> medroxyprogesterone (in Indivina), dienogest or drospirenone.|$|E
25|$|When {{appropriate}} (e.g., {{in women}} of child-bearing age who require contraception), a standard contraceptive pill is frequently {{effective in reducing}} hirsutism. Progestogens such as norgestrel and <b>levonorgestrel</b> should be avoided due to their androgenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins norgestrel or levonorgestrel; and sometimes defined as those containing the progestins norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etynodiol acetate, norgestrel, <b>levonorgestrel,</b> or norgestimate and < 50nbsp&µg ethinylestradiol.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{contraceptives}} are prescribed in {{the treatment}} of menorrhagia to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The hormonal IUD (Mirena) releases <b>levonorgestrel</b> which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone as {{a regular}} {{contraceptive}} at 2mg daily prevents ovulation (1mg daily does not). A single preovulatory 10-mg dose of mifepristone delays ovulation by three to four days and is as effective an emergency contraceptive as a single 1.5-mg dose of the progestin <b>levonorgestrel.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} well tolerated with few significant side effects. Side effects may include irregular menstrual periods, no periods, headaches, and breast pain. Use {{is not recommended}} in people with significant liver disease. The <b>levonorgestrel</b> implant {{is a type of}} long-acting reversible birth control. It primarily works by stopping ovulation and by thickening the mucus around the cervix.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral {{contraceptive}} medications {{are effective in}} reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. Estrogen and progesterone compounds available {{for use in the}} correction of menorrhagia are ethinylestradiol and <b>levonorgestrel</b> (Levona, Nordette, Lutera, Trivora). Administration of ethinylestradiol diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Three {{types of}} {{emergency}} contraceptive pills are available: combined estrogen and progestin pills, progestin-only (<b>levonorgestrel,</b> LNG) pills, and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills. Progestin-only and antiprogestin pills are available as dedicated (specifically packaged for use as) emergency contraceptive pills. Combined estrogen and progestin pills {{are no longer}} available as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills, but certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills {{may be used as}} emergency contraceptive pills.|$|E
25|$|In August 2000, Wyeth {{suspended}} {{shipments of}} Norplant in the United States because during regular quality assurance monitoring, representative samples of seven lots distributed beginning October 20, 1999 tested within product specifications, {{but at the}} lower end of the release rate specification for shelf life stability, raising concerns about those lots' contraceptive effectiveness. Wyeth recommended that women who had Norplant capsules from those lots implanted use backup contraception until they determined the clinical relevance of the atypically low levels of <b>levonorgestrel</b> release.|$|E
25|$|Levonorgestrel-releasing implant, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Jadelle among others, is a device {{made up of a}} two rods of <b>levonorgestrel</b> used for birth control. It {{is one of the most}} {{effective}} forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.05%. The device is placed under the skin and lasts for up to five years. It may be used by women who have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and therefore cannot use an intrauterine device. Following removal fertility quickly returns.|$|E
25|$|Progestin-only {{emergency}} contraceptive pills contain <b>levonorgestrel,</b> {{either as a}} single tablet or as a split dose of two tablets taken 12hours apart, effective up to 72hours after intercourse. Progestin-only ECPs are sold under many different brand names. Progestin-only ECPs are available over-the-counter (OTC) in several countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, India, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, United States), from a pharmacist without a prescription, and available with a prescription in some other countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and <b>levonorgestrel,</b> are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
25|$|A levonorgestrel-releasing implant was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1983 in Finland and in the United States in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 8.93 to 13.29 USD per set. <b>Levonorgestrel</b> implants are approved in more than 60 countries and used by more than seven million women. As of 2015 it is approved but not available in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Norplant II (Norplant-2, Jadelle), also {{developed}} by the Population Council and manufactured by Schering Oy, consists of two small (2.5mm × 43mm) silicone rods each containing 75mg of <b>levonorgestrel</b> in a polymer matrix, instead of six capsules. It was approved May 31, 1996 by the FDA as being effective for three years; it was subsequently approved November 22, 2002 by the FDA as being effective for five years. Jadelle has not been marketed in the United States; Jadelle is the successor to the original Norplant in USAID's contract beginning January 2007.|$|E
25|$|One {{concern about}} the use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone <b>levonorgestrel</b> in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.|$|E
25|$|It was {{developed}} by Sheldon J. Segal and Horatio B. Croxatto at the Population Council beginning in 1966, with the first clinical trial in Chile in 1974. It was first approved in Finland on November 23, 1983, where it was manufactured by Leiras Oy Pharmaceuticals. The original Norplant consisted {{of a set of}} six small (2.4mm × 34mm) silicone capsules, each filled with 36mg of <b>levonorgestrel</b> implanted under the skin in the upper arm and effective for five years. The original (six capsule) Norplant's production has been phased out; USAID's contract ran until December 2006.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like <b>levonorgestrel,</b> norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
500|$|Emergency {{contraceptive}} {{methods are}} medications (sometimes misleadingly {{referred to as}} [...] "morning-after pills") or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse {{with the hope of}} preventing pregnancy. They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization. They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded. A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, <b>levonorgestrel,</b> mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs. <b>Levonorgestrel</b> pills, when used within 3days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%). Ulipristal, when used within 5days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and might be a little more effective than <b>levonorgestrel.</b> Mifepristone is also more effective than <b>levonorgestrel</b> while copper IUDs are the most effective method. IUDs can be inserted up to fivedays after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%). This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive. In those who are overweight or obese <b>levonorgestrel</b> is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.|$|E
500|$|The current intrauterine devices (IUD) {{are small}} devices, often 'T'-shaped, often {{containing}} either copper or <b>levonorgestrel,</b> which are {{inserted into the}} uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control. Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the <b>levonorgestrel</b> IUD has a failure rates of 0.2% {{in the first year}} of use. Among types of birth control, they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users. [...] As of 2007, IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception, with more than 180million users worldwide.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{research}} in progress on more genes and biomarkers {{that may be}} linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the <b>levonorgestrel</b> IUD placed for a year, combined with 6monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. [...] Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is anastrozole, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and aminoglutethimide and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.|$|E

2500|$|Temporary {{disruption}} of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced. If taken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in <b>levonorgestrel</b> treatments may induce progestogen withdrawal bleeding {{a few days after}} the pills are taken. One study found that about half of women who used <b>levonorgestrel</b> ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the pills. If <b>levonorgestrel</b> is taken after ovulation, it may increase the length of the luteal phase, thus delaying menstruation by a few days. Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may delay ovulation by 3–4 days (delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation). These disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ECPs were taken; subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected. If a woman's menstrual period is delayed by two weeks or more, it is advised that she take a pregnancy test. (Earlier testing may not give accurate results.) ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{not used}} {{according}} to their package directions, but instead used according to the directions of <b>levonorgestrel</b> emergency contraceptive pills (up to 72 hours after intercourse), they would be estimated to have a [...] "perfect-use" [...] (when not used {{according to their}} package directions but used as directed on the package directions for <b>levonorgestrel</b> emergency contraception pills) pregnancy rate of 20% per year when used as the sole means of contraception (as compared to a 40% annual pregnancy rate for the Yuzpe regimen).

2500|$|There {{are various}} {{concerns}} {{about the effects of}} pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents. [...] Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water. [...] In a study by Dr. Jerker Fick from Umeå University rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage water at three different sits in Sweden. [...] They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis. [...] The progestin <b>Levonorgestrel</b> was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level. [...] Studies show that the measured effluent level of <b>Levonorgestrel</b> in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2006, the Pharmacy Board of the Washington State Department of Health {{rejected}} a draft rule proposed by Governor Gregoire requiring all pharmacies to begin carrying Plan B <b>levonorgestrel.</b> [...] Governor Gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the Board members to reconsider {{or they could}} be removed. [...] In April 2007, the Board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from refusing to provide Plan B for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for “good faith” business reasons.|$|E
