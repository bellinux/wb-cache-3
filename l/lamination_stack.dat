40|$|The Morrison rotor, {{named after}} its inventor, is a hybrid rotor {{for use in}} a bearingless switched-reluctance {{electric}} motor. The motor is characterized as bearingless {{in the sense that it}} does not rely on conventional mechanical bearings: instead, it functions as both a magnetic bearing and a motor. Bearingless switched-reluctance motors are attractive for use in situations in which large variations in temperatures and/or other extreme conditions preclude the use of conventional electric motors and mechanical bearings. In the Morrison motor, as in a prior bearingless switched-reluctance motor, a multipole rotor is simultaneously levitated and rotated. In the prior motor, simultaneous levitation and rotation are achieved by means of two kinds of stator windings: (1) main motor windings and (2) windings that exert levitating forces on a multipole rotor. The multipole geometry is suboptimum for levitation in that it presents a discontinuous surface to the stator pole faces, thereby degrading the vibration-suppression capability of the magnetic bearing. The Morrison rotor simplifies the stator design in that the stator contains only one type of winding. The rotor is a hybrid that includes both (1) a circular <b>lamination</b> <b>stack</b> for levitation and (2) a multipole <b>lamination</b> <b>stack</b> for rotation. A prototype includes six rotor poles and eight stator poles (see figure). During normal operation, two of the four pairs of opposing stator poles (each pair at right angles to the other pair) levitate the rotor.

The relative lengths of the circular and multipole lamination stacks on the rotor can be chosen to tailor the performance of the motor for a specific application.

40|$|This paper compares four {{prototype}} Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRMs) {{having an}} identical geometry of iron <b>lamination</b> <b>stacks</b> in the stator and rotor. Two different stator winding layouts are employed: a conventional three-phase star connection and a combined star–delta winding. In addition, two rotors are considered: a conventional rotor without magnets and a rotor with ferrite magnets. The {{performance of the}} four SynRMs is evaluated using a two-dimensional (2 D) Finite Element Model (FEM). For the same copper volume and current, the combined star–delta-connected stator with Permanent Magnets (PMs) in the rotor corresponds to an approximately 22 % increase in the output torque at rated current and speed compared to the conventional machine. This improvement is mainly thanks to adding ferrite PMs in the rotor {{as well as to}} the improved winding factor of the combined star–delta winding. The torque gain increases up to 150 % for low current. Moreover, the rated efficiency is 93. 60 % compared to 92. 10 % for the conventional machine.

Available now, the conversion of wind power into electricity is and will continue to be an important element of energy self-sufficiency planning. This paper is one in a series intended to report on the development of a new type of generator for wind energy; a compact, high-power, direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (DD-PMSG) that uses direct liquid cooling (LC) of the stator windings to manage Joule heating losses. The main param-eters of the subject LC DD-PMSG are 8 MW, 3. 3 kV, and 11 Hz. The stator winding is cooled directly by deionized water, which flows through the continuous hollow conductor of each stator tooth-coil winding. The design of the machine is to a large degree subordinate to the use of these solid-copper tooth-coils. Both steady-state and timedependent temperature distributions for LC DD-PMSG were examined with calculations based on a lumpedparameter thermal model, which makes it possible to account for uneven heat loss distribution in the stator conductors and the conductor cooling system. Transient calculations reveal the copper winding temperature distribution for an example duty cycle during variable-speed wind turbine operation. The cooling performance of the liquid cooled tooth-coil design was predicted via finite element analysis.

40|$|As NASA {{seeks to}} fulfill its goals of {{exploration}} and understanding through missions planned to visit the moons of Saturn and beyond, a number of challenges arise {{from the idea of}} deep space flight. One of the first problems associated with deep space travel is electrical power production for systems on the spacecraft. Conventional methods such as solar power are not practical because efficiency decreases substantially as the craft moves away from the Sun. The criterion for power generation during deep space missions are very specific, the main points requiring high reliability, low mass, minimal vibration and a long lifespan. A Stirling generator, although fairly old in concept, {{is considered to be a}} potential solution for electrical power generation for deep space flight. A Stirling generator works on the same electromagnetic principles of a standard generator, using the linear motion of the alternator through the stationary stator which produces electric induction. The motion of the alternator, however, is produced by the heating and cooling dynamics of pressurized gases. Essentially heating one end and cooling another of a contained gas will cause a periodic expansion and compression of the gas from one side to the other, which a displacer translates into linear mechanical motion. NASA needs to confirm that the materials used in the generator will be able to withstand the rigors of space and the life expectancy of the mission.

40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the efficiency {{and the cost of}} electrical machines has been observed. The efficiency of electric motors is important because electric motors consume about 40 %- 45 % of the produced electricity worldwide and about 70 % of the industrial electricity 1. Therefore, some types of electric motors have been classified in proposed standard classes 1 based on their efficiency. By consequence, efficient and low cost electric motors are necessary on the market. Several types of electric motors are used in industrial applications such as permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), induction motors (IMs) and reluctance motors (RMs). Due to the high cost of PMSMs and due to the rotor losses of the IMs, the RMs can be considered as promising and attractive candidates. Moreover, they have a robust and simple structure, and a low cost as there are no cage, windings and magnets in the rotor. There are two main types of RMs: switched reluctance motors (SRMs) and synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs). However, there are some disadvantages of these types of machines. On the one hand, the SRMs have problems of torque ripple, vibrations and noise. In addition, their control is more complicated than that of three-phase conventional motor drives, a. o. because of the high non-linearity of the inductance. On the other hand, the SynRMs have a low power factor, so that an inverter with a high Volt-Ampère rating is required to produce a given motor output power. Therefore, adding a proper amount of low cost permanent magnet (PM) material - such as ferrite - may be a good option to boost the power factor. The PMs also increase the efficiency and torque density. These types of motors are [...] 1 Waide, P. and C. Brunner (2011),”Energy-Efficiency Policy Opportunities for Electric Motor Driven Systems”, IEA Energy Papers, No. 2011 / 07, OECD Publishing, Paris. xiv Summary called permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMaSynRMs). In this thesis, both SynRMs and PMaSynRMs are investigated. The main focus is given to the rotor design, magnetic material grade and winding configuration. In addition, the modelling and control of SynRMs and PMaSynRMs is also investigated. First, parametrized models are made of the machines. The finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain the dq-axis flux-linkages λd(id, iq, θr) and λq(id, iq, θr) of the SynRM in static 2 D simulations, as a function of d-axis current id, and q-axis current iq and rotor position θr. As known, the performance (output torque, power factor and efficiency) of SynRMs depends mainly on the ratio between the direct (d) and quadrature (q) axis inductances (Ld/Lq). This ratio is well-known as the saliency ratio of the SynRM. As magnetic saturation causes significant changes in the inductances and by consequence in the saliency ratio during operation, a SynRM model based on constant inductances (Ld and Lq) is not good enough. It can lead to large deviations in the prediction of the torque capability compared with the real motor. How large these deviations are, is clarified in this thesis by comparing several models that do or do not take into account saturation, cross-saturation and rotor position effects. It is found that saturation and cross saturation must be included in the model for an accurate representation of the SynRM performance and control. This means the flux linkages should be function of id and iq. The rotor position needn’t be included. Apart from the currents, the FEM contains many parameters for the flux barrier geometry, which have a strong influence on the torque and torque ripple of the machine. Next to static simulations, also dynamic simulations are done. In these simulations, the flux-linkages are stored in lookup tables, created a priori by FEM, to speed up the simulations. Based on the SynRM FEM model, the design of the SynRM rotor is investigated. Choosing the flux-barrier geometry parameters is very complex because there are many parameters that play a role. Therefore, an optimization technique is always necessary to select the flux-barrier parameters that optimize the SynRM performance indicators (maximize the saliency ratio and output torque and minimize the torque ripple). To gain insight in the relevant parameters, first a sensitivity analysis is done: the influence of the flux-barrier parameters is studied on the SynRM performance indicators. These indicators are again saliency ratio, output torque and torque ripple. In addition, easy-to-usexv parametrized equations are proposed to select the value of the two most crucial parameters of the rotor i. e. the flux-barrier angle and width. The proposed equations are compared with three existing literature equations. At the end, an optimal rotor design is obtained based on an optimized technique coupled with FEM. The optimal rotor is checked mechanically for the robustness against mechanical stresses and deformations. Apart from the geometry, the electric steel grade {{plays a major role in}} the losses and efficiency of an electric machine. Therefore, several steel grades are compared with respect to the SynRM performance i. e. output torque, power factor, torque ripple, iron losses and efficiency. Four different steel grades NO 20, M 330 P- 50 A, M 400 - 50 A and M 600 - 100 A are considered. The steel grades differ in thickness and in the losses they produce. It was found that the “best” grade NO 20 had in the rated operating point of the considered SynRM 9. 0 % point more efficiency than the “worst” grade M 600 - 100 A. Next to energy-efficiency, a large interest in recent research is dedicated to obtain a high torque density. One of the main techniques to improve the machine torque density is to increase the fundamental winding factor through an innovative winding layout. Among several configurations, the so-called combined star-delta winding layout was proposed in literature several years ago. In the PhD, the combined stardelta winding is compared with the conventional star winding in terms of output torque, torque ripple and efficiency. A simple method to calculate the equivalent winding factor of the different winding connections is proposed. In addition, the modelling of a SynRM with combined star-delta winding is given. Furthermore, the effect of different winding layouts on the performance of the SynRM is presented. To compare both windings experimentally, two stators are made, one with combined star-delta windings and one with conventional star windings, having the same copper volume. Measurements revealed a 5. 2 % higher output torque of the first machine at rated current and speed. In order to even further improve the power factor and the output torque of the SynRM, ferrite PMs are inserted in the center of the rotor flux-barriers. The rotor geometry of the resulting PMaSynRM is the same as the conventional SynRM. Hence, two rotors with identical iron <b>lamination</b> <b>stack</b> were built: one with PMs and a second one without magnets. Having the two stators and two rotors, a comparison of fourxvi Summary prototype SynRMs is done in the PhD, each of 5. 5 kW. Several validation measurements have been obtained. The combined-star delta SynRM with PMs in the rotor had up to 1. 5 % point more efficiency than the SynRM with star winding and rotor without magnets at the rated current and speed. As an application of SynRM, an efficient and low cost photovoltaic (PV) pumping system employing a SynRM is studied. The proposed system does not have a DC-DC converter that is often used to maximize the PV output power, nor has it storage (battery). Instead, the system is controlled in such a way that both the PV output power is maximized and the SynRM works at the maximum torque per Ampère, using a conventional three phase pulse width modulated inverter. The design and the modelling of all the system components are given. The performance of the proposed PV pumping system is presented, showing the effectiveness of the system...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the NACA Lewis laboratory to determine whether simulated porous gas-turbine blades fabricated by the Eaton Manufacturing Company of Cleveland, Ohio would be satisfactory with respect to coolant flow for application in gas-turbine engines. These blades simulated porous turbine blades by forcing the cooling air onto the blade surface through {{a large number of}} chordwise openings or slits between laminations of sheet metal or wire. This type of surface has a finite number of openings, whereas a porous surface has an almost infinite number of smaller openings for the coolant flow. The investigation showed that a blade made of sheet-metal <b>laminations</b> <b>stacked</b> on a support member that passed up through the coolant passage was completely unsatisfactory because of extremely poor coolant flow distribution over the blade surface. The flow distribution for two wire-wound blades was more uniform, but the pressure drop between the coolant supply pressure and the local pressure {{on the outside of the}} blades was too low by a factor ranging from 3 to 3. 5 for the required coolant flow rates. The pressure drop could be increased by forcing the wires closer together during blade fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{fields and}} eddy {{currents}} in thin electrical steel laminations {{are governed by}} the laws of magnetodynamics with hysteresis. If the lateral dimension of the laminations is large with respect to their width, the fields and currents generated under arbitrary excitation inside a lamination can be resolved accurately by solving a one-dimensional finite element magnetodynamic problem across half the lamination thickness. This mesoscopic model is able to produce, by averaging the necessary information, a homogenised laminated core model, {{to be used in the}} macroscopic modelling of electrical devices involving ferromagnetic <b>lamination</b> <b>stacks.</b> As each evaluation of the homogenised model at the macroscale implies a finite element simulation at the mesoscale, a monolithic implementation of the homogenisation method would be extremely time-consuming. Hence the idea of this study to use system identification techniques to construct an algebraic approximation of the homogenised model, to be used as a conventional constitutive relationship in two- or three-dimensional macroscale simulations. This pragmatic two-step homogenisation approach turns out to be quite accurate and efficient in practice, and it entails no implementation in the FE code, provided the latter offers enough flexibility in the description of the material laws...|$|R
40|$|Since twenty years, the L 2 EP {{develops}} a computation code based on Finite Element Method (FEM) to determine electromagnetic fields at low frequencies. To validate the computations, numerical results are generally compared to analytical solutions. But {{this can only}} be applied to simple cases. The best way to validate a new model is to compare the numerical results to measurements (For example, simulation results from a loss model [1] should be validated through their comparison to experimental measurements). Besides, some other recent research works concerning data assimilation [2], homogenisation [3], …, require also an experimental validation. Objective The goal of this project is the design of an experimental bench (like T. E. A. M workshop given by Compumag society [4]) {{in order to be}} used as a validation bench for different FEM computation examples. Thus, the geometry must be simple. An example is given in the following figure with one or two coils of tore form with a plate of square section between in order to impose the energy. The plate can be of parallelepiped form and must be removable to change the nature of the plate (copper, aluminium, steel, <b>lamination</b> <b>stacks</b> …). Furthermore, the position of the plate should be controlled and adjusted. Design of experimental benc...|$|R
40|$|Super Collider (SSC) {{will be a}} {{synchrotron}} containing 96 dipoles operating between 0. 13 T and 1. 35 T at 10 Hz. Each dipole’s 1. 865 m-long core is {{made from}} ~ 2900 steel laminations (lams), each 52 x 66 cm and 0. 635 mm thick. A n=d to minimize power supply costs and stringent field specifications led to a straight core with very tight mechanical tolerances {{of the order of}} 0. 05 mm. To satisfy these tolerances, we decided to stack the core in a vertical posit io ~ i. e., with the Iaminat iom laid horizontally. We designed and built an unusual vert ical stacking fixture that pivots into a horizontal position after all the <b>laminations</b> have been <b>stacked</b> and compressed and four support angles welded onto the <b>laminations.</b> The <b>stacking</b> fixture, our experience using it, and conclusions as to the merits of stacking such a long core vertically will be described.

40|$|International audienceThe {{consideration}} of thin and wire conducting regions (e. g., <b>lamination</b> <b>stacks</b> in magnetic cores, foil windings, wires in stranded conductors) in finite element (FE) analyses {{is a source}} of difficulty regarding the mesh as well as the numerical solving. An isolated thin or wire volume region can efficiently be reduced to surface or line elements satisfying the actual distributions or interface conditions of the fields. Nevertheless, when numerous thin or wire regions are juxtaposed and separated with insulating layers, the whole resulting region must remain volumic and its homogenization is usually the only feasible solution for a 3 -D FE analysis. Homogenization models are nevertheless tainted with errors, in particular on the border of the homogenized domains. Local corrections of homogenized solutions are proposed to be performed via sequences of FE subproblems (SPs), in certain thin or wire regions separately, surrounded by their insulating layers and the remaining regions kept homogenized. The correction SPs use sources calculated from the homogenized solution and allow local corrections of the fields and current densities in regions of interests, allowing to improve the determination of global quantities as well, such as Joule losses, resistances and inductances. Practical sequences of SPs, involving homogenization models followed by their corrections, with a handy way to define the required sources, will be developed and applied to practical test problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{composite}} structures based on _bre angle optimisation rapidly becomes intractable {{as the number}} of design variables increases. Lamination parameters can be used instead as intermediate design variables in order to overcome this issue. An extra step is then required in order to convert the optimal design expressed in lamination param- eter into feasible blended stacking sequences. However, disparities between the <b>lamination</b> parameter and <b>stacking</b> sequence designs performance are generally observed due to dis- crepancies between both design spaces. In this paper, the lamination parameter blending constraints recently proposed by the authors are applied to the aeroelastic optimisation of the common research wing model in order to diminish these discrepancies and achieve more realistic lamination parameter designs. A comparison between the optimised designs achieved with and without the proposed blending constraints is carried out to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that the application of blending constraints greatly in- creases the matching quality between <b>lamination</b> parameter and <b>stacking</b> sequence designs, consequently facilitating the retrieval of equivalent blended stacking sequences.
