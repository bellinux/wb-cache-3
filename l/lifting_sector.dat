40|$|Allseas Engineering bv is an {{engineering}} {{center of the}} Allseas group, {{a major player in}} the offshore pipe lay market and recently expanding the activities to the offshore heavy <b>lift</b> <b>sector.</b> Because of the necessity to design and build lifting structures and equipment of a tremendously high capacity, the demand for high-strength steels usage has been arisen. These steels are to be welded and used in a harsh offshore environment. Localized heating and melting of a workpiece during welding lead to the build-up of residual stresses. When distortion is prevented due to constraints in structures or due to clamping, stress levels will be high and may exceed the yield strength. Post weld treatments are often carried out to mitigate or re-distribute the residual stresses. Ultrasonic impact techniques make use of the combined effects of the high frequency impacts and ultrasonic oscillations in the treated material. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) has been applied successfully to increase the fatigue life of parts and welded elements, to eliminate distortion caused by welding and other technological processes, to relieve residual stresses, and to increase the hardness of materials. Although reported results on fatigue life are very promising, the detailed changes induced in the treated material and the mechanisms by which such changes occur are still poorly understood. In this research, the main objectives are to understand the stress build-up during multi-pass welding, and the mechanisms involved in post weld ultrasonic impact treatments, how these affect the residual stress state in the welded area.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the Nigerian government economic reform programme in 1986, various incentives have been granted to the manufacturing sector, as a means of <b>lifting</b> the <b>sector</b> from the constant low level of performance and contribution to GDP. This paper sets out to find out how these various government incentives have impacted on manufacturing output – with specific focus on the food sub sector. By studying the operating profile of selected food-manufacturing companies, using the Pearson correlation analysis with relevant output, employment and price index variables, {{it was found that the}} benefits of these incentives appear not to have been passed on to the general public. It is thus recommended that bench-mark performance expectations be set for manufacturers as a pre-condition for granting incentives in subsequent dispensations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results and lessons learnt from converting the Cultural Heritage Management Office in Oslo’s Yellow List of architecturally and culturally valuable buildings into a Linked Data server. The study was performed {{in the context of}} the Semicolon II project, as a foray into the more general problem of <b>lifting</b> public <b>sector</b> information. The paper argues, that whilst the benefits of adopting the Linked Data distribution model are many and important, the required transformation to RDF is not unproblematic. Specifically, one needs to ensure that the information content of a dataset is preserved undistorted despite the change of representation. This can not be assumed to be the case by default, since a transformation will often alter the very structure of the dataset. The paper draws attention to the concept of a bounded RDF homomorphism as a means to address this problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been rapidly growing {{interest}} in developing a more robust, internationally competitive construction sector in Australia. All major stakeholders are involved in associated initiatives - industry, government, research sector and interest groups. There has been a significant improvement in the level and quality of communication between major stakeholders which is yielding initiatives that promise to <b>lift</b> future <b>sector</b> performance. However, it is early days yet and concrete improvements are modest at this stage. The performance of Australia's construction sector remains far short of its potential. Australia's construction sector operates against a background of industry fragmentation, intense competition, falling profits and new challenges including IT advancements; increasing public interest in environmental protection; increasing demand for packaged construction services; and moves toward private-sector funding of public infrastructure. Innovation and innovative behaviour are seen as key opportunities to raise the sector's performance and meet new challenges. However, to date, innovation in the Australian construction sector has been marked by poor innovation levels, government programs of limited effectiveness and poor uptake of those innovation programs that are available...|$|R
40|$|Productivity of New Zealand’s {{construction}} sector is declining {{compared with other}} countries and with most other sectors of the New Zealand economy. In response, the New Zealand government has set a target to <b>lift</b> construction <b>sector</b> productivity by 20 % from the year 2010 to 2020. Development and use of new tools is {{seen as part of}} the solution, as is the adoption of international construction best practice. Lean Construction approaches are among those considered international best practice; construction industry experience with Lean is widely used and reported around the world in North America, Europe and Asia, but adoption has been very limited in New Zealand to date. The basis of the research was the low level of implementation of Lean methods, more accurately Last Planner System (LPS) in New Zealand commercial construction. The focus of the research was on the perceived benefits and challenges of LPS and the factors which hinder its implementation in New Zealand companies. While the findings indicate that benefits and challenges are generally perceived to be the same as those reported internationally, procurement methods have been raised as a key issue when considering the obstacles to implementation in the New Zealand context...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperIn recent years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} given to the effects of removing trade restrictions on natural resource utilization and on poverty, especially in developing countries. Our paper adds to the growing body of conceptual work to show conditions under which a developing country that, in isolation, is unable to produce enough to meet subsistence consumption requirements of its residents can gain from participation in international trade. Using a small-country, two-sector, steady-state, general equilibrium model, we explore autarky conditions and the circumstances under which trade - perhaps supplemented by resource management - is able to <b>lift</b> all <b>sectors</b> of an economy out of poverty. Indeed, trade may be necessary for survival. However, if subsidies to subsistence sectors are required in order for such trade to take place, international prohibitions or restrictions could return the country to its autarky conditions and, with them, the return of poverty to some sectors. While the model abstracts considerably from "real world" conditions, it may help explain why some countries find it difficult to participate in free trade in the absence of domestic subsidy programs. Those in the more developed world holding expectations about WTO participation by developing countries may need to exercise caution in advocating policy reform that would preclude - or eliminate - such programs...|$|R
40|$|In 2002 a {{high-level}} economic review committee recommended that Singapore position {{itself as a}} 'global schoolhouse'. An ambitious target was set to attract 150, 000 international students to Singapore by 2015 and to <b>lift</b> the education <b>sector's</b> contribution to GDP from 1. 9 % to 5 % in the same timeframe. The global schoolhouse was viewed as producing a number of policy complementarities including addressing population, labour market and economic priorities. This article reviews the last 10 years of Singapore's global schoolhouse strategy from its inception until the present time. It examines the policy successes and setbacks, and present statistical evidence of its performance. In particular, the article examine the development of {{both the public and}} private higher education sectors in Singapore, the growth of the tuition grant scheme in the public universities and the introduction of the Private Education Act of 2009 in the private sector. It is argued that the 2011 general election in Singapore has proved to be an historic watershed and exposed considerable tensions between local needs and global ambitions in higher education...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} first order form of the NS string sigma model {{allowing}} for worldsheet couplings corresponding on the target space to a bi-vector, a two-form and an inverse metric. <b>Lifting</b> the topological <b>sector</b> of this action to three dimensions produces several Wess-Zumino like terms which encode the bi-vector generalization of the Courant bracket. This bracket may be familiar to physicists through the (H_{ijk},F_{ij}^{k},Q_i^{jk},R^{ijk}) notation for non-geometric backgrounds introduced by Shelton-Taylor-Wecht. The non-geometricity of the string theory in encoded in the global properties of the bi-vector, when the bi-vector is a section then the string theory is geometric. Another interesting situation emerges when one considers membrane actions which are not equivalent to string theories on the boundary of the membrane. Such a situation arises when one attempts to describe the so-called R-space (the third T-dual of a T^ 3 with H_ 3 flux). This model appears to be, at least classically, described by a membrane sigma model, not a string theory. Examples of geometric backgrounds with bi-vector couplings and non-vanishing Q-coefficients are provided by gauged WZW models. Comment: 21 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} main {{results from a}} five-year {{research}} project on health Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAps) aimed at supporting the transition from project approach to SWAps. The principal hypotheses tested were that: (i) SWAp is a dynamic approach and not a blueprint model; (ii) SWAp has major advantages over the project approach; (iii) however, SWAp is not a panacea. A multidisciplinary (public health, economics) research group, financed by the Belgian cooperation, {{was set up in}} 2004, comprising teams from 3 Belgian universities and a focal point from the Dept. of Development Cooperation. Over the 5 years, the group performed several missions in sub-Saharan Africa (3 in Mali, 3 in Benin, 2 in Senegal, 4 in Rwanda, 5 in Tanzania and 1 in Uganda). An analysis grid and 3 types of questionnaires were used to assess and follow-up the evolution of the SWAp dynamics and its results, which showed that (i) SWAps are not a rigid model and is definitely a dynamic way of working together between a government and its development partners. The core elements of a SWAp are a common sector strategy and a country-led coordination mechanism. However, different elements of the SWAp mature over time in a context-specific way. SWAps should constantly evolve and be used as a means of making progress in sector policy, planning, service provision and evaluation. (ii) SWAps can quickly bring in some positive results, especially in terms of coherence and coordination of interventions; policy dialogue, trust building and common understanding between partners; and ultimately sector reforms and health outcomes. Thus they have major advantages over the project approach. (iii) However, SWAps are not a panacea and its means should not be confounded with its ends, that is, improving sector performance. SWAps entail risks (notably those of technocratisation, centralisation and disconnection from field realities) and need to be constantly fuelled by shared analyses and common reform projects aiming at <b>lifting</b> major <b>sector</b> constraints. The case studies helped accumulating a good knowledge of SWAp dynamics at central level, but the evaluation of the impact of SWAps on health outcomes – which was also analysed – is uneasy. The results from the case studies were used by the Belgian cooperation and other stakeholders to accompany the SWAp dynamics, especially in Mali where a technical assistant was appointed to support the process. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of economic globalization has been the increased importance of foreign direct investment around the world. Over the past two decades, the international flow of FDI has increased {{by a factor of}} almost 10 (see Figure 18. 1). To put this trend in perspective, it might be noted that, by comparison, international trade flows only doubled over almost the same period. However, the increase in FDI has not been consistent over this time span. There were periods of stagnation—the first half of the 1980 s and 1990 s—followed by periods of explosive growth. During the second half of those same decades, the annual rate of growth of FDI was close to 25 percent. Latin America did not take advantage of the first FDI boom of the late 1980 s, primarily because of macroeconomic instability and restrictions on some sectors of FDI and on the repatriation of profits and capital. FDI inflows into the region remained fairly stable from 1980 through 1993, increasing {{at an annual rate of}} less than 2 percent. The FDI boom into Latin America began around 1993, when most of the restrictions mentioned above had been <b>lifted,</b> and infrastructure <b>sectors</b> were opened to private participation. Between 1993 and 1999, flows into the region grew at almost 30 percent per year. As a result of the latest boom, Latin America has regained the share in FDI flows it had lost during the late 1980 s, and is currently receiving around 10 percent of all FDI flows. Furthermore, while FDI flows to the developing world have increased spectacularly, other forms of capital flows have remained fairly stagnant. Thus, in recent years FDI has represented by far the most important source of private external financing for Latin America. In 1999, FDI represented nearly 97 percent of total net private capital flows into the region...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{innovation}} and the decreasing costs of wireless and other technologies, combined with progressive policy and regulatory environments, {{have resulted in}} the provision of telecommunication services in remote areas thought unserviceable by incumbent telcos in Latin America, Central Europe, and Asia. In line with the increasing number of success stories {{in other parts of the}} world, the South African government, as part of the policy of "managed liberalization" of the telecommunications <b>sector,</b> <b>lifted</b> the monopoly provision of telephone services in under-serviced areas by permitting smaller-scale entrants into the telecommunications market. Emerging from the second round of telecommunications policy reform in 2001, following the initial reforms to the sector in 1996, it was anticipated that these special operators would be licensed in 2002. Although licenses were finally granted following several licensing delays in June 2004 to seven applicants (three conditionally) from the ten areas demarcated in the first round, further delays in the final issuing of these licenses meant these licensees were only able to become operational in 2005. With the Ministry of Communications' latest policy directives on further liberalization of the market, which allows for some of the services previously reserved for Under-Serviced Area Licensees (USALs) to be more widely available from February 2005, just prior to the underserviced area licensees coming on stream, the window of opportunity for these small-scale new entrants may have closed. This paper assesses the degree to which policy and regulatory conditions promote the viability of these operators and facilitate their evolution as business and developmental models. Drawing on international experience, the policy and regulatory framework for these licenses is assessed. -super- 2 The paper focuses specifically on other jurisdictions where similar regimes have been introduced as part of a national policy rather than on the wide range of pilot projects deploying innovative technologies that may provide low-cost solutionsbut which are not scaled up or formally implemented. -super- 3 The key success factors in these jurisdictions are weighed in relation to the sustainability of the underserviced area operators (often referred to as regional or rural operators in other jurisdictions) under the conditions that exist in South Africa. Finally, it provides some lessons for other developing countries wishing to consider the South African experience. Copyright (c) 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} impact on the rural poor of a {{combination}} of an IMF/World Bank sourced structural adjustment program and two economic recovery programs as implemented by the revolutionary government in sub-Saharan Ghana over the 1983 - 86 and 1987 - 89 periods. From a pre-independence position in the mid- 1950 s of enjoying the highest per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa, over the next two decades, the Ghanaian economy was caught in a downward economic cycle owing to adverse external market conditions as well as inept and increasingly corrupt economic management. The virtual collapse of Ghana's economy by 1980 - 81, prompted a military coup in December 1981. Thereafter, an extensive structural adjustment program, underpinned by the injection of $US 1 billion by the IMF/World Bank, was undertaken in conjunction with a series of domestic-sourced economic recovery program measures with the objective of arresting further socio-economic decline. The neoclassical instruments of exchange rate devaluation as well as stringent fiscal and monetary policy measures were employed by the government to address the principal macroeconomic features of Ghana's economic crisis, as well as reliance on better terms of trade and export earnings to get the economy back on the road to recovery. While urban households were the worst affected by the adverse economic conditions and external shocks of the 1980 s, at least two-thirds of those in rural Ghana lived in absolute poverty by the early 1980 s. Stringent fiscal reform measures saw a virtual collapse of already very poor delivery of public sector services to the rural population. The ongoing structural adjustment program was directed to the recovery of export earnings from cocoa, so that its effects had a higly uneven impact on the rural population when the real income of cocoa producers recovered. Then when the government overcame its reluctance to implement measures to redress the worst effects of its adjustment program on the poor and vulnerable groups, little was achieved owing to inadequate funding, poor design and even poorer implementation. The decline in rural poverty actually achieved over the relevant period was due to economic growth, not expenditure-switching effects of the two economic recovery programs. Higher spending sourced in lower debt repayments, to maintain key social infrastructure services such as health and education, research, advisory and agricultural extension services as well as faster rehabilitation of economic infrastructure would have yielded high social and economic returns particularly in the rural <b>sector,</b> <b>lifting</b> income and well-being levels of the poor and other vulnerable groups...|$|R
