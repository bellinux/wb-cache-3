TEST and telemetry system are partially efficient owing to the limitation of the duration of monitoring. This paper presents a new system dedicated to real-time cardiac arrhythmias teleassistance and monitoring. This system is generally composed of 4 main configurable elements: wireless ECG sensor, <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>unit,</b> remote centre server, and remote surveillance terminal. The main technical challenges of this system include three aspects: a real-time automatic ECG diagnostic algorithm, an embedded real-time multi-task operating system, and a real-time reliable telemedicine communication protocol. This paper gives our solutions to these problems and specifies the technical details. Currently, this system has been evaluated on thirty patients at the CHRU of Gabriel Montpied hospital (Clermont-Ferrand, France) and also been {{used to test the}} athletes ’ cardiac status during the physical exercises. The performance results show that this system meets fully the requirements of real-time cardiac monitoring and diagnosing application and {{can be used as a}} long-term cardiac healthcare equipment.

40|$|Wideband {{radiowave}} propagation measurements in the DECT {{frequency band}} are {{performed in a}} suburban environment. The aim is to analyse the fixed radio link between the subscriber's premises and the <b>local</b> exchange <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> for different heights and pointing directions of the antenna at the subscriber side. Measured complex impulse responses are {{used to calculate the}} path loss and rms time delay spread of this wireless localloop communication channel. For both line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS) links, the Iowest path Ioss and rms time delay spread are found when the antenna points to the <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> at the <b>local</b> exchange side. On the average, no significant decrease in path Ioss and rms time delay spread is observed when the height of subscriber antennae is increased from 2 m to 4 m above the ground. However for LOS links and NLOS links which are affected by attenuation due to vegetation, the path Ioss can be minimized by a proper choice of the antenna height...|$|R

40|$|Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks}} and <b>local</b> loop unbundling have been central in the 1999 {{review of the}} EU communications regulatory framework. These issues also figure high on national policy agendas. Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> is thought to stimulate internet penetration {{and the development of}} e-commerce and interactive applications, all key elements for the move towards a 'new economy'. Following an analysis of different ways to promote competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks and}} a review of the respective EU debate, this paper then concentrates on the relevant developments in Britain. At a broader level, it explores the interplay between EU debates and British policies and actions and the scope for harmonisation of national regulatory regimes. At a more specific level, the paper assesses the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>access</b> competition and relates this to the role of regulation and the question of facilities- vs. services-based entry. It is argued that the introduction of new market restructuring initiatives, such as local loop unbundling, requires a larger involvement by regulators, particularly in the early stages, rather than just a reliance on general competition rules.

40|$|More {{customization}} {{and adaptation}} of coded data streams may {{be achieved by}} processing the information signal such that the various syntax structures obtained by pre-coding the information signal are placed into logical data packets, each of which being associated with a specific data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, and by defining a predetermined order of data packet types within one <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> of data packets. The consecutive <b>access</b> <b>units</b> in the data stream may, for example, correspond to different time portions of the information signal.; By defining the predetermined order among the data packet types it is possible, at decoder's side, to detect the borders between successive <b>access</b> <b>units</b> even when removable data packets are removed from the data stream on {{the way from the}} data stream source to the decoder without incorporation of any hints into the reminder of the data stream. Due to this, decoders surely detect the beginnings and endings of <b>access</b> <b>units</b> and therefore are not liable to a buffer overflow despite a removal of data packets from the data stream before arrival at the decoder...|$|R

40|$|In a {{distributed}} {{programming environment}} with location transparency, fast access to remote resources is absolutely critical for efficient program execution - {{but it is}} not sufficient. Locality optimization will try to group objects according to their communication patterns and replace remote <b>access</b> by <b>local</b> <b>access</b> whenever possible. Locality optimization {{is based on the assumption}} that <b>local</b> <b>access</b> always is much faster than remote access. Using conventional communication packages like RMI, this assumption is void. A remote object always needs an access layer around it to allow access to the object by means other than direct reference. Transparent access to a remote object also needs to overcome this access layer, even in a <b>local</b> <b>access.</b> Direct reference access can not be used, because of different parameter passing semantics. In this paper we present techniques to provide transparent <b>local</b> <b>access</b> to potentially remote objects in the same magnitude as direct Java access...|$|R

30|$|The {{elementary}} concept at the NAL {{level is}} the NAL unit (NALU). An AVC NALU contains a header {{followed by a}} raw byte sequence payload. This header is made of a unique byte and includes a field to identify the type of NALU. A complete picture can be segmented into multiple NALUs, each carrying usually a coded slice or control information. The set of NALUs needed to decode a complete picture is called <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> AVC introduces a special type of <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> called instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR), which can be identified through the inspection of the NALU header. A sequence of <b>access</b> <b>units</b> starting with an IDR can be decoded independent of any previous pictures in the bitstream. The maximum NALU size can be configured as a parameter of the encoder {{in order to be}} adjusted to the maximum transmission unit (MTU).|$|R
5000|$|A set of NAL {{units in}} a {{specified}} form {{is referred to}} as an <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> The decoding of each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> results in one decoded picture.Each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> contains a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture. It may also be prefixed with an <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> delimiter to aid in locating the start of the <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> Some supplemental enhancement information containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture.The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units consisting of slices or [...] slice data partitions that represent the samples of the video picture.Following the primary coded picture may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or corruption of the data in the primary coded pictures. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present.Finally, if the coded picture is the last picture of a coded video sequence (a sequence of pictures that is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set), an end of sequence NAL unit may be present to indicate the end of the sequence; and if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream, an end of stream NAL unit may be present to indicate that the stream is ending.|$|R
