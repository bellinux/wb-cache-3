Brazilian Journal of Biomotricity, v. 5, n. 2, p. 80 - 86, 2011. The {{purpose of this}} study was to find out anthropometric measurements, body composition and somatotyping differences in high performer and <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> hammer throwers. 20 male hammer throwers of age 18 to 25 years were assessed for the study. Out of which 10 were high performers and 10 were low performers. All subjects were assessed for height, weight, widths, girths and skinfold thicknesses. The independent samples t-test revealed that high performer hammer throwers had significantly higher weight (p< 0. 01), sitting height (p< 0. 05), BMI (p< 0. 01) and lower leg length (p< 0. 01) as compared to low performers. The high performer hammer throwers were also found to have significantly greater all circumferences and skinfold measurements. High performers hammer throwers also had significantly higher % body fat (p< 0. 01), total body fat (p< 0. 01) and lean body mass (p< 0. 01) as compared to low performers. Endomorphy (p< 0. 01) and mesomorphy (p< 0. 01) were significantly higher in high performer hammer throwers whereas ectomorphy (p< 0. 01) was significantly greater among low performers. It is concluded that in most of the parameters there were significant differences between high performer hammer throwers and <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> hammer throwers, and the high performer athletes showed better anthropometric measurements and somatotyping scores...|$|E
40|$|Four {{breeding}} {{lines of}} white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{were obtained from}} AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, New Zealand, that had been shown previously to differ in terms of specific growth responses to added phosphate (P) in the field. These were designated Breeding Line (BL) 43 (<b>low</b> <b>performer</b> on low P; <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> on high P), BL 45 (<b>low</b> <b>performer</b> on low P; high performer on high P), BL 47 (high performer on low P; high performer on high P), and BL 49 (high performer on low P; <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> on high P). These breeding lines and five selected genotypes that were propagated from each line (designated 43 - 7, 43 - 8. 45 - 14. 45 - 4 and 47 - 9) were rooted in half-strength Hoagland solution in vermiculite for two weeks and then transferred to half-strength Hoagland liquid media for five weeks prior to the initiation of the experiments. For the breeding line screening, plants were acclimatized in a constant temperature environment for one week prior to treatments, while for the genotypic screening, plants were maintained in a temperature-controlled glasshouse. These lines and genotypes were characterized in relation to P uptake and utilization efficiency by growing in P-sufficient media (+P; 0. 5 mM KH 2 PO 4) and P-deficient media (-P; 0 mM KH 2 PO 4) for 3, 5, 7 and 14 days (for the breeding line screening) and 7, 14 and 21 days (for the genotype screening). Over the time course, inorganic phosphate (Pi) content in leaves, non-specific acid phosphatase (APase) activity in intact roots (both as a total soluble activity and a cell-wall-associated activity), isoenzyme analyses, shoot dry weight (DW) and fresh weight (FW), leaf area, weight of an individual leaf (designated as {{the weight of the}} first fully expanded leaf), root FW, and the root:shoot (R:S) ratio were determined. Pi deprivation enhanced the induction of one major low mobility cell wall acidic isoform, two minor high mobility cell wall acidic isoforms and one major low mobility cell wall basic isoform in all genotypes. Furthermore, the activity of one major low mobility cell wall basic isoform was more higher in genotype 45 - 14 and one minor high mobility cell wall basic isoform was induced only in genotype 45 - 14 in response to Pi deprivation. In terms of individual BLs and genotypes, the screening results showed that BL 49 and genotype 45 - 14 displayed a constant Pi content and a slow induction of APase activity in the -P media, and had the highest total biomass FW in both +P and -P media. Overall (in both treatments) BL 49 and genotype 45 - 14 are the most efficient at utilizing available P as they produced the largest biomass FW, produced more roots in P- deprived media when compared with the other BLs and genotypes, and were more efficient in utilizing the P for the synthesis of biomass. BLs 43 and 45 and genotypes 43 - 7 and 43 - 8 are less efficient at utilizing available P, while under P deprivation, BL 45 and genotype 45 - 14 are the most efficient at utilizing P compared to the other BLs and genotypes. The study also showed that the Pi content in leaves and APase activity in roots was found to be the plant parameter most sensitive to Pi deprivation, and the results suggest that the selection of white clover germplasm for satisfactory performance under low P availability can be carried out using these two parameters as criteria...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{associative}} learning is often hindered by confirmation bias and success-chasing, which together can conspire to produce or solidify false {{beliefs in the}} decision-maker. We performed {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} in 35 experienced physicians, while they learned to choose between two treatments in a series of virtual patient encounters. We estimated a learning model for each subject based on their observed behavior and this model divided clearly into high <b>performers</b> and <b>low</b> <b>performers.</b> The high performers showed small, but equal learning rates for both successes (positive outcomes) and failures (no response to the drug). In contrast, <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> showed very large and asymmetric learning rates, learning significantly more from successes than failures; a tendency that led to sub-optimal treatment choices. Consistently with these behavioral findings, high performers showed larger, more sustained BOLD responses to failed vs. successful outcomes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule while <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> displayed the opposite response profile. Furthermore, participants' learning asymmetry correlated with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens at trial onset, well before outcome presentation. Subjects with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens showed more success-chasing during learning. These results suggest that high performers' brains achieve better outcomes by attending to informative failures during training, rather than chasing the reward value of successes. The differential brain activations between high and <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> could potentially be developed into biomarkers to identify efficient learners on novel decision tasks, in medical or other contexts...|$|R

Previous {{data suggest}} that (i) {{dopamine}} modulates the ability to implement nonroutine schemata and update operations (flexibility processes) and that (ii) dopamine-related improvement {{may be related to}} baseline dopamine levels in target pathways (inverted U-shaped hypothesis). Objective. To investigate above hypotheses in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. Twenty PD patients were administered tasks varying as to flexibility load in two treatment conditions: (i) “off” condition, about 18 hours after dopamine dose and (ii) “on” condition, after dopamine administration. PD patients were separated into two groups: low performers (i. e., performance on Digit Span Backward below the sample mean) and high performers (i. e., performance above the mean). Twenty healthy individuals performed the tasks in two sessions without taking drugs. Results. Passing from the “off” to the “on” state, only <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> PD patients significantly improved their performance on high-flexibility measures (interference condition of the Stroop test; P< 0. 05); no significant effect was found on low-flexibility tasks.

The potential for stereotyping exists where faculty members repeatedly rate students ’ clinical competency. Stereotyping {{is difficult to}} study because of methodological problems. If, for example, a student’s score remains low over repeated ratings, {{it may be because}} the faculty member has pegged the student as a poor performer or because the student is in fact a consistently <b>low</b> <b>performer.</b> An existing dataset of clinical competency ratings for almost 300 students was divided so that ratings given by faculty members who had evaluated students previously could be compared to ratings of the same students by faculty members who had not previously evaluated these students. This study supports the following conclusions: 1) repeating faculty members use both current informa-tion and carryover information from previous rating periods; 2) the amount of information carried over increases from quarter to quarter; and 3) faculty evaluators who use more carryover information are more accurate in predicting students ’ graduation competency level than are faculty members on their initial ratings of students.

DMN was captured using independent component analysis of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data from 35 young healthy adults (27. 1 ± 5. 1 years). Metabolic connectivity, a correlation between FDG uptake in PCC and MPFC, was examined in groups of subjects with (relative to median) low (n= 18) and high (n= 17) performance on digit span backward test as an index of verbal WM. In addition, fiber tractography based on PCC and MPFC nodes as way points was performed in a subset of subjects.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the effects of pharmacological treatment with pergolide (a D 1 +D 2 receptor agonist) and pramipexole (a D 2 +D 3 receptor agonist) on performance in visual-spatial, visual-object, and verbal WM tasks in PD patients. Participants included 19 "de novo" PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC). The experimental task consisted of an n-back paradigm with verbal, visual-object, or visual-spatial stimuli. PD patients performed the task twice: after 18 - 24 h of therapy wash-out and after administration of pergolide (nine patients) or pramipexole (ten patients). HCs performed the task only once, without drug administration. Depending on how they performed in the "Off" and "On" therapy conditions, the nine PD patients each were classified into groups of low performers (i. e., performance on the n-back paradigm was below the median value of the experimental sample) and high performers (i. e., performance was above the median value). One PD patient was excluded from the analysis because his performance pattern clearly revealed that he was an outlier. In the <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> PD patients, administration of both pergolide and pramipexole improved accuracy on all WM tasks. No effect of the drugs was found in the high performer patients.

To understand why some MS have succeeded to meet their RE targets and others not, a high and a <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> are analysed and compared. Sweden was chosen as it is the most ahead of the 2020 targets, while France is among countries that are alarmingly behind their trajectories. Furthermore, an objective was to analyse the application and effectiveness of economic incentive schemes of the MS. As the geographic, technological and social premises to utilise RE sources are not similar between the EU countries, this study looked at how country-specific factors affect economic incentives. Summary The EU has set RE targets for 2020 and 2030. In the latest Directive it was outlined that each MS can contribute their part as best suits their progress prospects. Taxation and subsidies are named the key incentive instruments. On one hand, tax schemes can be compared as percentages and at the targets of taxation. Subsidies, on the other hand, opened a wider discussion with the number of possible approaches. This research focussed on feed-in tariffs (FITs), feed-in premiums, quotas, tradable green certificates and funding and grants. FITs and the quota system are the biggest instruments in France and Sweden respectively, and were thus discussed to a greater extent. The geographic, demographic and legislative environments were outlined to show the role they play as reasons and origins for the incentive structures. Conclusions The successful RE incentive schemes are those that are supported by the public and that in turn support the technological possibilities of the country. For the EU to reach the 2030 and further RE targets, many MS need more EU-level guidance to meet their individual contributions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rehabilitation and relapse {{prophylaxis}} for schizophrenia {{patients is}} limited by their neurocognitive impairment. Neurocognition {{and its impact on}} an integrated psychoeducational approach is investigated. Methods: Post-acute phase schizophrenia patients enrolled in a mixed naturalistic inpatient and outpatient (day clinic study) underwent cognitive testing before and after an integrated psychoeducational group program. Patients were classified into high and <b>low</b> <b>performer,</b> according to their level of cognition. The differential impact of cognitive impairment on subjective (ideas, concepts, insight about one's illness, self-esteem, etc.) and objective (knowledge gain, psychosocial functioning, compliance with medication, etc.) target criteria of psychoeducation was tested. Results: 1. Level of cognition was predictive for the course of treatment and was associated with negative symptoms. 2. While cognitive 'high performers' showed more adaptive concepts of illness, their quality of life did not improve significantly. 3. Psychoeducational knowledge gain was independent of the level of cognition; however, knowledge gain was always lower for 'low performers'. 4. Working memory and fluid intelligence showed a tendency effect on compliance when tested externally, but level of cognition before the psychoeducation intervention was not predicitive. Altogether, cognitive impairment differed significantly from measurement standard in all domains, as well as among study patients. Independent of neurocognition the psychoeducational program was effective for knowledge aquisition, but strong impairments led to fewer adaptive illness concepts. Likewise, failure to experience improvements in quality of life following treatment could result from neurocognitive limitations in transferring the gained knowledge into day-to-day practice. Relevance, as well as determinants of measurement quality and predictive value of neurocognition are discussed. Conclusion: The data shows, that neurocognition has a substantial impact on the efficacy of psychoeducation. Course of treatment and subjective target criteria could be enhanced by matching psychoeducational interventions to a patient's neurocognitive profile...|$|E

40|$|This mixed-methods study {{examined}} the interactions and learning outcomes of science teachers in an online graduate-level course on evolutionary biology intended to improve their content knowledge and science lesson planning. Discussion posts made by the teachers in this seven-week course were analyzed for cognitive presence using the Community of Inquiry framework. Compared to other studies examining cognitive presence, high levels of Integration level cognitive activity were observed (47 % of total posts). This was most likely due {{to the design of}} the discussion prompts and expectations used to frame student participation. The questions were open-ended, and students were expected to use reference materials to construct their responses. During the course, 395 student posts contained statements that could be coded for scientific accuracy. Of these, 85 % were coded as scientifically accurate. This reinforces reports from previous literature that the online environment is conducive to reflective and careful contributions by participants. As the course progressed, the number of faculty posts per discussion declined, while the number of student posts remained relatively constant. Student-to-student posts increased in frequency as faculty participation dropped. The number of student posts increased towards the end of each two-week discussion period, however the frequencies of posts with scientifically accurate statements and Integration level cognitive activity remained relatively constant over this same period. The increase in total posts was due to the increase in other types of communication in the discussions. Case study analysis was used to examine patterns of online behavior in three participants who achieved different course grades. A low-performing student had a pattern of intermittent activity, made low numbers of posts in each discussion, and had low percentages of posts that contained scientific statements or indicators of Integration level cognitive activity compared to classmates. A medium-performing learner posted infrequently but was efficient in making scientifically accurate posts that demonstrated Integration. Both the medium and <b>low</b> <b>performer</b> made most of their posts near the end of each two-week discussion period and had limited interaction with other learners. The high-performing learner demonstrated high levels of engagement with the course material. She posted frequently, introduced new resources to the other learners, and had high numbers of scientifically accurate and Integration level posts. An examination of teachers' views of the Nature of Science (NOS) using a pre- and post course Views of Nature of Science - C survey indicated that this group of teachers began the course with relatively informed views of many of the nature of science aspects. An exception was views about the nature of scientific theories and laws. At the start of the course 10 of 18 participants had naive views, five had partially informed views, and three had informed views. While scientific definitions of theories and laws were addressed in the course, there was no task that asked teachers to apply their understanding of this topic. When the course finished, six participants still had naive views, six held partially informed views, and six had informed views. Participants used course content to create teaching unit plans that indicated how they might use the course outcomes in their practice. Most of the learning objectives stated in the unit plans were grade-level appropriate when referenced to the Benchmarks for Science Literacy. The exception was the inclusion by some middle school teachers of detailed analyses of evolutionary relationships using genetic data. Although there was alignment of stated objectives to content from the online course and lesson activities, some of the teachers did not fully align assessments with their objectives. Based on these findings, it is suggested that designers of online instruction be mindful in the framing of learning tasks and use open-ended discussion prompts that require the use of reference materials if Integration level cognitive activity is the goal. The teachers in this course were generally able to utilize content from the course to create teaching applications, but more support for pedagogical applications could be an important addition for teachers who struggled with this task. This study reinforces previous research that indicates that online asynchronous discussions encourage reflection by learners. However, analysis of individuals who struggled in the course indicates that the online format may not suit all learners since consistent effort and the ability to communicate effectively in writing are important for success...|$|E
40|$|Prior work {{examines}} competitive {{moves in}} relatively stable markets. In contrast, {{we focus on}} less stable markets where competitive advantages are temporary and R&D moves are essential. Using evolutionary search theory and an experiential simulation with in-depth fieldwork, {{we find that the}} relationship between performance and subsequent competitive moves depends on the type of market, not just on whether performance is high or <b>low.</b> High <b>performers</b> seek to maintain status quo, but this requires different strategies in different markets. They are conservative in established markets and bold in new ones. In contrast, <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> seek to disrupt the status quo. Again, this requires different strategies in different markets. Unlike high <b>performers,</b> <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> are bold in established markets and conservative in new ones where they lack understanding of how to disrupt rivals. Overall, our results incorporate unstable markets in theories of competitive dynamics and competitive interaction in theories of evolutionary search. By examining R&D moves, we also extend competitive dynamics research to include technology-based firms for whom temporary advantages are often essential. Copyright 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the effectiveness of collaborative teamwork in a polytechnic (in Singapore) as an intervention strategy, especially for <b>low</b> <b>performers.</b> Using questionnaire surveys, this study investigated the changes in the students' motivational styles after they had worked in teams to complete a software development assignment. The self-worth related consequences of success and failure for high and <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> working in similar ability and mixed ability teams were also investigated. Another area that was investigated was the students' experience of working in teams and their perspectives on teamwork. Students were interviewed to find out their perceptions, feelings and behaviours when they were working in teams to complete their software development assignment. The motivational problems encountered by the students during the team working process were studied. While the mastery orientation factor scores of the four groups increased after the team assignment, the self-worth motivation factor scores for all the groups continued to be the highest, indicating that this maladaptive motivational style was still quite strong. The students continued to remain focused on ability. Ability differences were accentuated when students were allowed to form teams comprising of only <b>low</b> <b>performers.</b> Mixed ability teams also accentuated perceptions of ability differences. Even in high performers teams, high performers were found to be trying to demonstrate their ability to show that they were better than their teammates. Team failures resulted in accentuation of low ability, ability differences when comparing themselves to others, and feelings of shame and guilt, especially among the <b>low</b> <b>performers.</b> Some of the problems associated with team-working were found {{to be related to the}} maladaptive motivational styles of the students. For team work to be effective, teachers should address the potential problems of process and the factors that influence their occurrence. This is where constructivist theories of learning and instruction can provide a useful input to motivation theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

After the individual challenge, all players voted for one of the <b>lowest</b> <b>performers.</b> The top two vote-getters then competed in an elimination challenge as in earlier episodes.|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} {{in this study}} was: do business units that exhibit a "linkage" or "fit" between their business strategy and manufacturing strategy variables, outperform competitors who lack such a fit? This exploratory research focused on two business strategies: cost leadership and differentiation. Based on existing literature, twenty-four hypotheses concerning the relationship between business strategy and selected manufacturing strategy variables were developed. The manufacturing executives of eighty-eight broadwoven cotton fabric mills (SIC 2211) were surveyed using a qualitative questionnaire. Two sets of comparisons were made between the manufacturing strategy variables of the sampled firms: first, high vs. <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> pursuing cost leadership strategy; and second, high vs. <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> focusing on differentiation strategy. Within each set of comparisons, high performers reported linkage between their business strategies and selected manufacturing strategy variables. This study re-affirms the importance of linking business strategy with manufacturing strategy variables as a forceful weapon for overcoming competition...|$|R
40|$|Aim. Our {{purposes}} were to investigate: (a) {{differences in}} mood states {{between high and}} <b>low</b> <b>performers</b> {{at the beginning and}} end of the Girobio 2012 cycling race, and in respect to both actual and perceived performance; and (b) whether the participants’ mood states predicted actual and perceived performance. Methods. Profile of Mood States (POMS) of 72 elite cyclists were assessed the day prior to the first (T 0) and last stage (T 1). At the end of the race, we created two rankings, one based on the total time spent to complete the race (actual ranking) and one based on the average of self-evaluations provided at the end of each stage (perceived ranking). We compared high and <b>low</b> <b>performers,</b> considering both rankings, using a general measure of mood; i. e. the Total Mood Disturbance. Results. Total Mood Disturbance differed among high and <b>low</b> <b>performers.</b> In particular, high performers’ mood disturbance did not differ between T 0 and T 1, whereas low performing cyclists showed higher levels of mood disturbance at the end of the race. Furthermore, we found that mood disturbance at T 0 did not predict either actual or perceived performance. Conclusions. The cyclists’ mood states at the beginning of the race are not reliable predictors of performance throughout the race. High performing cyclists maintained a more positive mood profile than their low performing counterparts {{at the beginning and end}} of a multi-stage race...|$|R
