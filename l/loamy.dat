5|$|Scotch Run flows over Leck Kill soil, a {{deep and}} well-drained fine <b>loamy</b> soil for its entire length. However, the {{northern}} and southern edges of the watershed are on Hazleton soil, a deep, <b>loamy,</b> siliceous, well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and <b>loamy</b> soil on a {{steep slope}} (30–50%) with gravelly <b>loamy</b> surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.eburneus grow on the soil, mostly in {{coniferous}} woods, thickets and grassy areas. The fungus prefers soil that is moist, mesic, <b>loamy</b> and calcareous.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa is {{cultivated}} for its attractive needle-like {{leaves and}} rusty-brown flower spikes, {{both of which}} can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or <b>loamy</b> acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen forest with commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red <b>loamy</b> soil is also found. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV Seismic Zone, having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale on February 8, 1900.|$|E
5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in <b>loamy</b> clay or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and <b>loamy</b> soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the city region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and <b>loamy.</b> The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or <b>loamy</b> soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|The tree prefers {{moist and}} <b>loamy</b> soils, but is {{adaptable}} {{to a very}} wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade. In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas. The tree of heaven is found within {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China. In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and <b>loamy</b> soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red <b>loamy</b> soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
25|$|The spinifex {{hopping mouse}} (Notomys alexis), {{also known as}} the tarkawara or tarrkawarra, occurs {{throughout}} the central and western Australian arid zones, occupying both spinifex-covered sand flats and stabilised sand dunes, and <b>loamy</b> mulga and melaleuca flats.|$|E
25|$|The fenlands, {{that stretch}} down {{as far as}} Norfolk, are former {{wetlands}} consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes which were virtually all drained {{by the end of}} the 19th century when Firsby had its longest period of growth. The former peat fens and silt marshes provided a rich <b>loamy</b> soil that was ideal for the growing of cereal and vegetable crops, and gave Lincolnshire its reputation as being the 'bread basket' of England. The resulting flat lands also made an ideal environment for the later mechanisation of farming in the mid-20th century. Firsby has always been an agriculturally based village with a dark and rich <b>loamy</b> soil over a heavy clay subsoil.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} {{predominantly}} marked by dry, sandy soil, wide stretches {{of which have}} pine trees and erica plants, or heath. However, the soil is <b>loamy</b> in the uplands and plateaus and, when farmed appropriately, can be agriculturally productive.|$|E
25|$|Its geology {{is that of}} the North Downs, see Surrey - Geology; as to soil Chipstead, Banstead and Tadworth {{have the}} first free {{draining}} slightly acid <b>loamy</b> soil that tops the wider downs to Guildford and is found around Dorking.|$|E
25|$|This ash {{has since}} {{developed}} a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or <b>loamy</b> sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{here has}} the {{expected}} shallow, lime-rich soil over chalk or limestone of the escarpment with lower {{parts of the}} escarpment summit here, where the topsoil has eroded, having slightly acid, <b>loamy</b> and clayey soils with impeded drainage, which makes that soil particularly fertile.|$|E
25|$|Soils in Columbia {{are well}} drained in most cases, with grayish brown <b>loamy</b> sand topsoil. The subsoil may be {{yellowish}} red {{sandy clay loam}} (Orangeburg series), yellowish brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the Ultisol soil order.|$|E
25|$|This {{species has}} a very limited {{distribution}} in the Australian Northern Territory. It is endemic to the area between Darwin and Berry Springs, but is fairly common there. It grows in the <b>loamy</b> sand of seasonally flooded depressions and in the shallow margins of freshwater lagoons. Here it shares its habitat with B. liniflora. which is however native to dryer regions elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{deposits of}} middle sands have been extensively worked around the Cheshire area for building purposes, they vary from clean sharp sand to somewhat <b>loamy</b> deposits {{with layers of}} clay. Whilst never quarried in any great quantity at Alderley, the Upper Mottled Sandstone in the main is incoherent enough to be quarried for sand and there are large reserves available {{at the foot of}} the Edge escarpment near the Hough.|$|E
25|$|Bangalore has {{a handful}} of {{freshwater}} lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit {{in the area and}} includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine <b>loamy</b> to clayey soils.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} little known in cultivation. It germinates well, but is {{difficult}} to establish and slow to grow. It has been grown successfully in <b>loamy</b> soil in northern Victoria, but attempts to grow it in the sandy soils of Perth have failed. Tony Cavanagh and Margaret Pieroni suggest that as a compact shrub with attractive foliage {{it would be best}} suited to a small garden. It requires warm, dry weather with near full sun, and heavy well drained soils. It is hardy to drought and frost.|$|E
25|$|Most of Goa's {{soil cover}} {{is made up}} of laterites rich in ferric-aluminium oxides and reddish in colour. Further inland and along the riverbanks, the soil is mostly {{alluvial}} and <b>loamy.</b> The soil is rich in minerals and humus, thus conducive to agriculture. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between Molem and Anmod on Goa's border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as Trondjemeitic Gneiss estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by rubidium isotope dating. A specimen of the rock is exhibited at Goa University.|$|E
25|$|Warren has a hilly topography, {{caused by}} two factors: the {{underlying}} geology, {{which consists of}} infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometre (50mi) long strip of coastal limestone {{on top of a}} ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting <b>loamy</b> soil, lateritic soil, leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.|$|E
25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be found in dry and rocky watercourses, but is most often found in clusters on rocky jump-ups and colluvial slopes of rocky mesas with weathered silcrete rocks and <b>loamy</b> soils. The most dense populations of this species are found on the lower slopes that have high water retention because of deep colluviums. The altitude of the known locations of G. kennedyana is between 140 m and 200 m and is found on slopes that vary from 10˚, which is relatively flat to a steep slope of 75˚. Populations are found under very little or no tree and shrub canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|Glaciation and the {{resulting}} glacial and fluvio-glacial deposition has had a vast impact on the geology of England covering many areas with a veneer of glacial till in the lower lying areas north of a line running from Bristol to London. In the Ribble valley, Lancashire in north west England {{the resulting}} drumlins are clearly visible. Cromer Ridge in East Anglia is a terminal moraine. Indeed, most of East Anglia is covered with glacial till which has produced its rich <b>loamy</b> soils. This unconsolidated material (it is not stuck tightly together) is very easily eroded hence the rapid rate of retreat of the coastline of this region.|$|E
25|$|See {{the image}} for the {{biological}} {{life cycle of}} the hookworm where it thrives in warm earth where temperatures are over 18°C. They exist primarily in sandy or <b>loamy</b> soil and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages must be more than 1000mm (40inches) a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of Necator americanus can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of Ancylostoma duodenale are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live {{for only a few}} weeks at most under natural conditions, and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.|$|E
25|$|In May, June or July, females {{normally}} lay {{a clutch}} of 1 to 11 eggs into a flask-shaped nest excavated {{in a patch of}} sandy or <b>loamy</b> soil. After 70 to 80 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the small hatchlings emerge from the nest in late summer. In the northern parts of its range, the common box turtle may enter hibernation in October or November. They burrow into loose soil, sand, vegetable matter, or mud at the bottom of streams and pools, or they may use a mammal burrow, and will remain in their chosen shelter until the cold winter has passed. The Common box turtle has been known to attain the greatest lifespan of any vertebrate outside of the tortoises. One specimen lived to be at least 138 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, {{and poorly}} {{cemented}} sands {{up to several}} miles deep. The region's geology developed from stream deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath these tiers is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into dome shapes, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. This thick, rich soil also provides a good environment for rice farming in suburban outskirts into which the city continues to grow near Katy. Evidence of past rice farming is even still evident in developed areas as an abundance of rich, dark, <b>loamy</b> top soil exists.|$|E
25|$|Silent Valley is rectangular, twelve {{kilometres}} {{from north}} to south and seven from east to west. Located between 11°03' to 11°13' N (latitude) and 76°21' to 76°35' E (longitude) it is separated from the eastern and northern high altitude plateaus of the (Nilgiris Mountains) by high continuous ridges including Sispara Peak (2,206 m) {{at the north end of}} the park. The park gradually slopes southward down to the Palakkad plains and to the west it is bounded by irregular ridges. The altitude varies from 658 m to 2328 m at Anginda Peak, but most of the park lies within the altitude range of 880 m to 1200 m. Soils are blackish and slightly acidic in evergreen forests where there is good accumulation of organic matter. The underlying rock in the area is granite with schists and gneiss, which give rise to the <b>loamy</b> laterite soils on slopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or mattocks must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed earth between the furrows, the fields are often cross-ploughed lengthwise and widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to <b>loamy</b> or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|E
25|$|Cilicia Pedias ("flat Cilicia"—; Assyrian Kue), to the east, {{included}} the rugged spurs of Taurus {{and a large}} coastal plain, with rich <b>loamy</b> soil, known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (euthemia), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, {{and that the united}} rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.|$|E
500|$|Crystal Palace lies {{approximately}} [...] to {{the south}} east of Charing Cross on the Norwood Ridge and includes {{one of the highest}} points of London at 112metres above the mean sea level (OS map reference TQ337707). The Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, in the centre of the park, lies at 88metres above the mean sea level. [...] The soil in the area has been classified as typically [...] "Slowly permeable, seasonally wet, slightly acid but base-rich <b>loamy</b> and clayey soils", with impeded drainage, moderate fertility and a <b>loamy</b> profile.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{periodic}} inundation of Southern California by the ocean, most of the Aliso Creek watershed is underlain by several layers of marine sedimentary strata, the oldest dating from the Eocene (55.8–33.9MYA) and the most recent, the Pliocene (5.33–2.59MYA). These alluvial sediments range from [...] in depth. Generally throughout the watershed, there are five major soil and rock outcrop types—Capistrano sandy loam, Cieneba sandy loam, Marina <b>loamy</b> sand, Myford sandy loam, and Cieneba-rock outcrop. The water table ranges from [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|Cambrian to Ordovician-age dolomite, {{part of the}} Wappinger Group, and {{calcareous}} shales {{from the}} Hudson River Group underlie the Fonteyn Kill. Between 15–20 kya, a glacial lake covered the land that would become the Fonteyn Kill. Till {{and to a lesser}} extent other glacial sediments today sit atop the dolomite and shale. Surrounding soils are <b>loamy,</b> either silt loam or gravelly loam depending on the underlying surficial geology. The streambed is composed of about 25% sand, silt, and clay and approximately 75% cobbles. Quicksand was once common around the Fonteyn Kill and its minor tributaries. The distance covered by the stream is noted as being relatively flat, descending between [...] over the course of its run.|$|E
