500|$|Markley became {{motivated}} by the large crowd a rock band like the Yardbirds attracted, particularly the number of teenage girls, and proposed he would finance and secure a recording contract for the Laughing Wind, {{in exchange for his}} inclusion into the group. Impressed and slightly seduced by the much older Markley's wealth and entourage, the band accepted his offer. The decision to record as the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, rather than the Laughing Wind, was made by Markley, who envisioned the band as a west coast counterpart to the Velvet Underground. Looking to have something tangible to represent the band, in 1966, the WCPAEB released their debut album on Markley's FiFo <b>label,</b> <b>Volume</b> One. Much of the album was recorded at Lloyd's personal studio and a rented store-front on La Cienega Boulevard, before Markley joined the group; however, tracks such as [...] "Don't Break My Balloon" [...] and [...] "If You Want This Love" [...] indicate he had some influence over the later sessions for the album's development.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Preclinical in vivo imaging {{requires}} {{precise and}} reproducible delineation of brain structures. Manual segmentation is time consuming and operator dependent. Automated segmentation as usually performed via single atlas registration fails {{to account for}} anatomo-physiological variability. We present, evaluate, and make available a multi-atlas approach for automatically segmenting rat brain MRI and extracting PET activies. METHODS: High-resolution 7 T 2 DT 2 MR images of 12 Sprague-Dawley rat brains were manually segmented into 27 -VOI <b>label</b> <b>volumes</b> using detailed protocols. Automated methods were developed with 7 / 12 atlas datasets, i. e. the MRIs and their associated <b>label</b> <b>volumes.</b> MRIs were registered to a common space, where an MRI template and a maximum probability atlas were created. Three automated methods were tested: 1 /registering individual MRIs to the template, and using a single atlas (SA), 2 /using the maximum probability atlas (MP), and 3 /registering the MRIs from the multi-atlas dataset to an individual MRI, propagating the <b>label</b> <b>volumes</b> and fusing them in individual MRI space (propagation & fusion, PF). Evaluation {{was performed on the}} five remaining rats which additionally underwent [18 F]FDG PET. Automated and manual segmentations were compared for morphometric performance (assessed by comparing volume bias and Dice overlap index) and functional performance (evaluated by comparing extracted PET measures). RESULTS: Only the SA method showed volume bias. Dice indices were significantly different between methods (PF>MP>SA). PET regional measures were more accurate with multi-atlas methods than with SA method. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-atlas methods outperform SA for automated anatomical brain segmentation and PET measure's extraction. They perform comparably to manual segmentation for FDG-PET quantification. Multi-atlas methods are suitable for rapid reproducible VOI analyses...|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Come to Daddy" [...] (released in October 1997) was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham and filmed on the same council estate where Stanley Kubrick shot many scenes in A Clockwork Orange. [...] The scene is shot around Tavy Bridge Shopping centre, Thamesmead, which was demolished in 2007. Much of the dark underground car parking is now gone. The video opens with an old woman walking a dog in a grimy, industrial setting. The dog urinates on an abandoned television lying on the pavement, causing it to sputter unexpectedly into life, and a distorted and warping headshot of Richard D. James chants the lyrics. This unleashes a spirit, accompanied by a gang of small children, all of whom bear James' grinning face and who appear to inhabit the abandoned buildings. The children go around wreaking havoc, trashing an alley and chasing a man into his car. The thin man (played by Al Stokes) emerges from the television, screams in the woman's face, then gathers the children around him. It is the only music video in the top 50 of The 100 Greatest Scary Moments as voted by Channel 4 viewers in 2003. The video is included on the Directors <b>Label</b> <b>volume,</b> The Work of Director Chris Cunningham. The video was also named the number one video of the 1990s by Pitchfork.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Virtual unpacking: (a) {{all objects}} in packed positions; (b) -(g) images {{extracted}} from the animation of unpacking the red doll, which first moves towards the camera, then it flies to the top-right corner of the image; and (e) most objects are in unpacked positions. We present a system for luggage visualization where any object is clearly distinguishable from its neighbors. It supports virtual unpacking by visually moving any object away from its original pose. To achieve these, we first apply a volume segmentation guided by a confidence measure that recursively splits connected regions until semantically meaningful objects are obtained, and a <b>label</b> <b>volume</b> whose voxels specifying the object IDs is generated. The original luggage dataset and the <b>label</b> <b>volume</b> are visualized by volume rendering. Through an automatic coloring algorithm, any pair of objects whose projections are adjacent in an image are assigned distinct hues that are modulated onto a transfer function to both reduce rendering cost {{as well as to}} improve the smoothness across object boundaries. We have designed a layered framework to efficiently render a scene mixed with packed luggage, animated unpacking objects, and already unpacked objects put aside for further inspection. The system uses GPU to quickly select unpackable objects that are not blocked by others to make the unpacking plausible. ...|$|E
