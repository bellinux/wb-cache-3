40|$|The p-norm {{often used}} in stress {{constrained}} topology optimisation supposedly mimics a delta function and it is thus characterised by a small length scale and ideally one would also prefer to have the solid-void transition occur over a small length scale, since the material in this transition {{does not have a}} clear physical interpretation. We propose to resolve these small length scales using anisotropic mesh adaptation. We use the method of moving asymptotes with interpolation of sensitivities, asymptotes and design variables between iterations. We demonstrate this combination for the portal and <b>L-bracket</b> problems with p= 10, and we are able to investigate mesh dependence. Finally, we suggest relaxing the <b>L-bracket</b> problem statement by introducing a rounded corner...|$|E
50|$|The GB1 Hero proton packs were {{fiberglass}} shells {{mounted on}} aluminum motherboards with LC-1 ALICE Frames and straps. These packs had many aluminum parts on them, including: aluminum Ion Arm and cap, booster tube, injector tubes, HGA, vacuum line, PPD, Beamline and filler tube, {{as well as}} the N-Filter. The wands for these packs were also fully aluminum, minus the resin grips. All these external parts were pop riveted to the shell, which was then, in turn, mounted to the motherboard via <b>L-Brackets</b> and bolts at the four corners of the pack.|$|R
50|$|Rack-mountable {{equipment}} is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, {{it is common}} for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including table-top and wall mounting, so rack mountable equipment will often feature <b>L-brackets</b> that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) {{wall plate}} system {{consists}} of lipped C-channel (acting as a wall plate), anchor plates (U and <b>L-brackets),</b> screwed and bolted connections. The wall plate system {{is used in}} roof structures to resist vertical loading from roof trusses and rafters {{at the same time}} ensure that the roof trusses and rafters are properly aligned. Although CFS wall-plate has been widely used locally in Malaysia, no study has been conducted in this area. Therefore the actual capacity and behaviour of the system is still not known. A series of laboratory tests are conducted to study the interaction of the elements in the wall-plate system, and a numerical model is built to facilitate the parametric study. An efficient design is proposed and the results would serve as a guide to the local (Malaysia) construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} one of the most talked about issues of the modern world. Solar energy is the most popular; it is everywhere, and there is an{{unlimited}} supply. Solar panels were invented to collect this unlimited energy. There are many devices that help these panels work better, but most of them are not used at their 100 -percent efficiency since at the amount of sunrays are depend on the complexities of locations, times, directions, and price. Therefore, this project is about building a simple device that not only can track the sun from east to west, but also different angles that make the panels perpendicular to the sun at three main different times of the year. The device is made from standard Aluminum 6061 -T 6, which is lightweight, and not expensive. <b>L-Brackets,</b> bolts and screw threads connect all parts of the device. The stepper motor will turn the panels’ frame from east to west. The torque needed for the device is calculated carefully, and it has the safety factor of 2. The device is tested by using electronic multimeter to measure the produced voltage and current. Then it will be compare with a fixed solar device. This project 2 ̆ 7 s result is expected to be more efficient than the benchmark devices by about 15 to 20 percent, and also a benchmark for other future projects that are in the same category...|$|R
