2500|$|For space {{launches}} from Earth, {{relatively short}} acceleration distances (less {{than a few}} km) would require very strong acceleration forces, higher than humans can tolerate.

[...] Nevertheless, if technically feasible and cost effective to build, imparting hyper-velocity escape velocity to a projectile launching at sea level, where the atmosphere is the most dense, may result {{in much of the}} launch velocity being lost to aerodynamic drag.

50|$|Rockets {{are usually}} {{launched}} into a space above the launch range called the <b>launch</b> <b>corridor.</b> If rocket engines fail while the rocket flies inside the corridor, the rocket falls in an uninhabited area. Engine failure outside the <b>launch</b> <b>corridor</b> may cause the rocket to fall on people or property. Therefore, if the rocket is about to exit the <b>launch</b> <b>corridor,</b> the RSO will terminate powered flight {{to ensure that no}} debris falls outside the <b>launch</b> <b>corridor.</b> This involves sending coded messages (typically sequences of audio tones, kept secret before launch) to special redundant UHF receivers in the various stages or components of the launch vehicle. On receipt of an 'arm' command, liquid-fueled rocket engines are shut down. A separate 'fire' command detonates explosives, typically linear shaped charges, to cut the propellant tanks open and disperse their contents.|$|E
50|$|To {{launch a}} space vehicle with humans on board, a mass driver's track {{would need to}} be several {{hundreds}} of kilometers long if providing almost all the velocity to Low Earth Orbit, though lesser length can provide major launch assist. Required length, if accelerating mainly at near a constant maximum acceptable g-force for passengers, is proportional to velocity squared. For instance, half of the velocity goal could correspond to a quarter as long of a tunnel needing to be constructed, for the same acceleration. For rugged objects, much higher accelerations may suffice, allowing a far shorter track, potentially circular or helical (spiral). Another concept is a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a <b>launch</b> <b>corridor</b> leading skyward.|$|E

50|$|While certain {{authorisations}} {{had been}} obtained for Kaitorete, such as stormwater and air discharge permits from Environment Canterbury, a coastal permit for {{occupation of the}} area, and a Department of Conservation permit, the Christchurch City Council had not consented to the development due to an incomplete Cultural Impact Assessment, resulting in no action under Sections 95 and 104 of the Resource Management Act 1991. The company said that efforts would continue to gain consent for a launch pad on Kaitorete Spit due to its logistical superiority and the foreseen need for additional facilities, but that the Mahia site offered superior <b>launch</b> <b>corridor</b> and flight rate opportunities because of its geographical location and relatively sparse air traffic. The Mahia site is licensed for a maximum launch rate of once every 72 hours {{over a period of}} 30 years—Rocket Lab believes the actual rate would average once per week—while the Kaitorete site would only have been licensed to launch once per month.|$|E
50|$|Space {{vehicles}} for sub-orbital and orbital flights from the Eastern and Western Test Ranges were destroyed if they endangered populated areas by crossing pre-determined destruct lines encompassing the safe flight <b>launch</b> <b>corridor.</b> To assist the RSO {{in making a}} flight termination decision, there are many indicators showing {{the condition of the}} space vehicle in flight. These included booster chamber pressures, vertical plane charts (later supplanted by computer-generated destruct lines), and height and speed indicators. Supporting the RSO for this information were a supporting team of RSOs reporting from profile and horizontal parallel wires used at lift-off (before radar could capture the vehicle) and telemetry indicators. After initial lift-off, flight information is captured with X and C-band radars, and S-Band telemetry receivers from vehicle-borne transmitters. At the Eastern Test Range, S and C-Band antennas were located in the Bahamas {{and as far as the}} island of Antigua, after which the space vehicle finished its propulsion stages or is in orbit. Two switches were used, ARM and DESTRUCT. The ARM switch shut down propulsion for liquid propelled vehicles, and the DESTRUCT ignited the primacord surrounding the fuel tanks. In the case of manned flight, the vehicle would be allowed to fly to apogee before the DESTRUCT was transmitted. This would allow the astronauts the maximum amount of time for their self-ejection.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} portion of the territory controlled by the VRS was located in western Bosnia, including the Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka. This portion of Bosnian Serb-held territory was dependent on resupply from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia using a single road spanning the Bosnian Sava Basin from west to east through Derventa and Brčko. The same road was also used to resupply the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia. After the capture of Derventa by the HVO and the HV in May 1992, the VRS <b>launched</b> Operation <b>Corridor</b> 92 and regained control of the resupply route in late June. By October, it had eliminated all HV or HVO-held pockets along the southern bank of the Sava and the border of Croatia, except a single bridgehead around the town of Orašje.

40|$|Abstract. The Romanian NERVA space project, {{aimed at}} {{building}} {{and using a}} small rocket launcher for injecting nano-satellites into a LEO, requires {{the establishment of a}} secure launching area. The first candidate is on the western coast of the Black Sea and the candidate <b>launching</b> and flight <b>corridor</b> is the west-east vector above the sea. A series of ecological and safety challenges appear due to the high population density of the regions close to the sea-shores of the Black Sea; they must be catalogued and securely solved, before any space activity above the Black Sea begins. The main challenges of such an endeavor are analyzed henceforth and several solutions that fall within the scope of a recent research activity of the NERVA team are proposed...|$|R
50|$|In June 1992 the VRS <b>launched</b> Operation <b>Corridor</b> against HV-HVO {{forces in}} Bosnian Posavina to secure an open road between Belgrade, Banja Luka and Knin. The VRS {{captured}} Modriča on 28 June, Derventa on 4-5 July and Odžak on 12 July. The outnumbered Croat forces {{were reduced to}} isolated positions in Bosanski Brod and Orašje, but were able to repel VRS attacks during August and September. In early October 1992, VRS managed to break through Croat lines and capture Bosanski Brod. HV/HVO withdrew their troops north across the Sava River. Croats and Bosniaks blamed {{each other for the}} defeats against the VRS. The Bosnian government suspected that a Croat-Serb cease-fire was brokered, while the Croats objected that the ARBiH was not helping them in Croat-majority areas. By late 1992, Herzeg-Bosnia lost a significant part of its territory to VRS. The territory under the authority of Herzeg-Bosnia became limited to Croat ethnic areas in around 16% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The VRS successes in northern Bosnia resulted in increasing numbers of Bosniak refugees fleeing south towards the HVO-held regions of central Bosnia. In Bugojno and Travnik, Croats found themselves reduced practically overnight from around half the local population to a small minority.|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of heavy metal bioavailabilities and contamination {{in the marine}} environment by the Mussel Watch Program has been proposed {{in order to maintain}} the coastal environment at a sustainable level. This study focused on the heavy metal concentrations in different parts of P. viridis collected from Kuala Perlis (Perlis), Kg. Pulau Sayak (Kedah), Pantai Sri Tujoh and Pantai Bisikan Bayu (both in Kelantan). The results indicated that the accumulation of Ni, Pb and Zn by the byssus were significantly different from the rest of the tissues. In particular, the accumulation of Cu by the crystalline style was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) from the other tissues. The above two findings were similar to those reported by Yap et al. (2005) and Yap et al. (2006 a). However, the concentrations of Ni, Pb and Zn found in different parts of P. viridis were generally lower than those reported by Yap et al.

The present findings are important in providing metal baseline information prior to the start of the newly <b>launch</b> Economic Development <b>Corridor</b> (NEDC) project...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about exotic {{earthworms}} (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) in Alaska outside its southeastern panhandle. This study documents the distribution of exotic earthworms in the relatively undisturbed Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR), a large, primarily wilderness refuge in southcentral Alaska. We sampled 69 sites near boat <b>launches,</b> along road <b>corridors,</b> and in low human impact areas > 5 km from the road, finding three species of earthworms (Dendrobaena octaedra, Dendrodrilus rubidus, and Lumbricus terrestris). Most road sites (90 %) and boat launches (80 %) contained earthworms; half (50 %) of low human impact sites contained earthworms. Distance to roads was the only significant factor in predicting earthworm occurrence; soil pH, soil moisture, leaf litter depth, and vegetation cover were not. The disparate distributions of these three species suggest that within the KNWR road construction and vehicle traffic {{played a role in}} dispersal of the widespread, abundant Dendrobaena octaedra and uncommon Dendrodrilus rubidus; bait abandonment appeared to be the primary method of introduction of Lumbricus terrestris. While the distribution of harmful anecic earthworms in KNWR is currently limited, the prohibition of Lumbricus spp. as bait within conservation units in Alaska may be warranted...|$|R
