The {{object of}} the study is the {{examination}} of the drafts <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>acts.</b> The subject <b>of</b> the research is the features ofexpert guarantee oflaw-making activities in France. The article?s objective is to highlight French experience of realizing the expertise of the drafts <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>acts</b> that necessitates the analysis <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> and institutional components of the expert guaranteeing of law-making in France. The need for achieving the objective of the study has led to the use of dialectical, formal and logical, systematic and comparative methods of cognition. The relevance {{of the study is}} the fact that the strategic direction of Ukraine?s legal system development in modern conditions is its entry into the European Union. This requires the system work in using European experience to ensure the quality of legislation. It is established that the necessary legal basis to assess the <b>regulatory</b> impact <b>of</b> the drafts <b>of</b> new <b>regulatory</b> decisions is created in France at the level of national Constitution and laws. The activity of the Committee on the evaluation and control over the public policy, the State Council, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, the Constitutional Council, administrative authorities with advisory powers is researched. It is proved that the institutionalization of expert assessments contributes counting methodological aspects and requirements of effective legal regulation at the stage of preparation of the law text, creates prerequisites for deepening cooperation between administrative authorities and institutions of civil society in law-making sphere. The practical significance of the work is the fact that grounded provisions and conclusions deepen scientific knowledge about expert guaranteeing of law-making. Obtained results can be used in teaching the theory of state and law and to solve practical problems related to the development and assessment of the drafts <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>acts.</b> It is concluded that the experience of expert guaranteeing of law-making in France requires further advanced research aiming at using it in the national law-making activity. ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????-???????? ????? ?? ???????. ???????????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????????, ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????????. ??????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ???? ?????...|$|R

This article analyses the activity of Lithuanian and EU regulatory agencies which are supervising business with regard to identify potential and arising challenges of optimising the performance <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> agencies. Methods: review of academic and legal literature, comparison, synthesis, statistical data analysis. Scientific aim: The aim of this article is to analyse the activities <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> agencies <b>of</b> Lithuania and European Commission and evaluate the actions in order to reduce administrative burdens as well as to identify the consolidation problem areas <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> agencies. Findings: The results of the analysis shows, that a unified <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> agencies is not in use and the research and other reform action taken by supervising authorities is being done using different sets <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> agencies, what leads to increasing of administrative burdens and ineffective regulatory agencies consolidation.

While {{the effort to}} think through potential consequences <b>of</b> proposed <b>regulatory</b> <b>acts</b> in advance is welcome, we argue that these effects are not only dependent on the investigated standards themselves, {{but also on the}} institutional environment where they unfold, which is heterogeneous in different jurisdictions. More importantly, insights from behavioural research on decision heuristics suggest that the public debate surrounding accounting reforms will evolve around the topics emphasised in effects studies, while other potential areas of interest are likely to be ignored. As costs of proposed standards are even harder to measure than costs of existing ones, a problem <b>of</b> <b>regulatory</b> overproduction could be exacerbated. We suggest a more modest approach of focusing on identifying 'failure conditions' under which new standards are likely to lead to detrimental consequences. © 2012 Copyright European Accounting Association...|$|R
