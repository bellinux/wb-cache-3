5000|$|In 1992, Winchester began {{producing}} a controlled round feed Model 70 that was marketed as the [...] "Classic" [...] model. This version reintroduced the CRF feature, while retaining the [...] "anti-bind" [...] locking <b>lug</b> <b>groove</b> bolt guide of the 1968 push feed model. The use of modern CNC manufacturing techniques allowed Winchester to re-introduce the CRF feature {{at a competitive}} price.|$|E
50|$|The Steyr M1912 handgun is {{operated}} by a system of short recoil, the barrel unlocking from the slide by rotation. As the pistol is being fired and the recoil of the pistol is in motion, a <b>lug</b> and <b>groove</b> system around the barrel rotate the barrel 20째 until a lug hits a stop wedge and holds the barrel while the slide is free to continue its rearward travel, the extractor claw withdrawing the spent casing against the breech face of the slide until the casing strikes the ejector and departs the weapon via the ejection and loading port. Shortly after ejection the slide's rearward travel is arrested by the compressed recoil spring and the abutment of mated surfaces of the slide and frame. The recoil spring is now free to return its stored energy to the cycle of the weapon by beginning to return the slide forward.|$|R
50|$|The Mondrag처n Modelo 1908 was a gas-operated rifle with a {{rotating}} bolt, and a cylinder and piston arrangement. This design is now common, but was unusual at the time. The bolt was locked by <b>lugs</b> in helical <b>grooves</b> in the receiver. There was a switch, {{located on the}} charging handle, which would disengage the bolt from the gas system, changing the firearm into a straight-pull, bolt action, rifle. The rifle had a non-detachable box magazine and was filled by two, five-round stripper clips. The Mondrag처n Modelo 1908 rifles were fitted with a bipod. In addition to the knife bayonet introduced with the previous rifles, Mondrag처n designed a spade bayonet for use with the Modelo 1908, for which he filed a patent application (No. 631,283) on June 6, 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The tread is {{the part}} of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface. The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the contact patch. The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite {{compound}} formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly. The tread pattern is characterized by the geometrical shape of the <b>grooves,</b> <b>lugs,</b> [...] and sipes. Grooves run circumferentially around the tire, and are needed to channel away water. Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface. Voids are spaces between lugs that allow the lugs to flex and evacuate water. Tread patterns feature non-symmetrical (or non-uniform) lug sizes circumferentially to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies. Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape to the sides in an effort to prevent hydroplaning.|$|R
