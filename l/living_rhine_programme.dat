50|$|The Upper Rhine plays a {{key role}} in flood control on the Middle and Lower Rhine. As a result of the {{straightening}} of the Upper Rhine, floods from the Alps now reach the Middle Rhine much faster than in the past. Thus, the risk of such a peak coinciding with a flood peak of Neckar, Moselle or Main has increased. About 123 km2 of flood plain have been lost. Authorities in riparian states of France, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have launched the Integrated <b>Rhine</b> <b>Programme,</b> a framework for designating water retention areas. to combat downstream flooding. A French-German treaty was concluded in 1982, in which the parties agreed to restore the retention capacity on the stretch below Iffezheim to the level it had before the area was developed.|$|R

5000|$|The Low Franconian languages, such as Dutch, are {{sometimes}} referred to as Istvaeonic languages because they are associated with a similar geographical area, although they appear only some centuries later than the reports of Tacitus and Pliny. (Whether the original Istvaeones of Tacitus and Pliny spoke a language ancestral to modern Istvaeonic is not certain, but it is possible. Some of the [...] "Germanic" [...] tribes <b>living</b> near the <b>Rhine</b> in that era may not even have spoken a Germanic language.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Laeti {{may have}} been groups of {{migrants}} drawn from the tribes that lived beyond the Empire's borders. These had been in constant contact and intermittent warfare with the Empire since its northern borders were stabilized in the reign of Augustus in the early 1st century. In the West, these tribes were primarily Germans, <b>living</b> beyond the <b>Rhine.</b> There is no mention in the sources of laeti in the Eastern section of the Empire. [...] Literary sources mention laeti only from the late 3rd and 4th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The Chattuari appear {{again in}} the {{historical}} record in the 4th century, <b>living</b> on the <b>Rhine</b> amongst the first tribes {{to be known as}} Franks. Ammianus Marcellinus reports that Emperor Julian, crossed the Rhine border from Xanten and......entered the district belonging to a Frank tribe, called the Attuarii, men of a turbulent character, who at that very moment were licentiously plundering the districts of Gaul. He attacked them unexpectedly while they were apprehensive of no hostile measures, but were reposing in fancied security, relying on the ruggedness and difficulty of the roads which led into their country, and which no prince within their recollection had ever penetrated.|$|R
50|$|The Casuari were {{an ancient}} Germanic people. Ptolemy {{mentions}} them as {{living on the}} southern border of Germany, east of the Abnoba mountains, that are east of the Rhine. They were therefore neighbours of the Tencteri, a tribe <b>living</b> between the <b>Rhine</b> and the Abnoba mountains. Their origins {{can be traced back}} to those of the Alemanni and Khatti, they descend from Assyrian tribes who migrated into Europe to settle. Ptolemy also mentions them as having founded the town of Suevos Casuari. The Casuari were most likely numerous during and around the time of Ptolemy, which is around 90 to 168 AD. Being a small tribe, very little remains of them, and most evidence comes from written sources.|$|R
40|$|Until 1985 {{migration}} of riverine fish for instance salmon and sea trout through the river Rhine system has dramatically declined {{due to the}} tremendous decrease of water quality {{and the construction of}} river regulation works such as weirs and dams and hydropower stations. During the last decades the water quality in the Rhine and therefore the environmental circumstances for migratory fish has improved significantly. At the same time on international level a discussion was started on the feasibility of restoring fish migration. In 1987 all countries along the river Rhine adopted the <b>Rhine</b> Action <b>Programme.</b> One of the aims of this plan is to restore the main stream as the backbone of the complex Rhine ecosystem and its main tributaries as habitats for migratory fish. The construction of fishways at the three weirs in the river Neder-Rhine was the major Dutch activity in restoring the migration route in the Rhine. Accurate investigations of the behaviour of different fish species and the required migration circumstances, resulted in a design of spacious pool- and weir fishways as bypass channels in the floodplain. To enable {{migration of}} different migratory fish species during the various discharge situations of the river the channels have V-shaped weirs with vertical slots...|$|R
50|$|A nemeton was {{a sacred}} space of ancient Celtic religion. Nemeta {{appear to have}} been {{primarily}} situated in natural areas, and, as they often utilized trees, they are often interpreted as sacred groves. However, other evidence suggests that the word implied a wider variety of ritual spaces, such as shrines and temples. Evidence for nemeta consists chiefly of inscriptions and place-names, which occur all across the Celtic world. Toponyms related to the word nemeton occur as far west as Galicia, Spain, as far north as Scotland, and as far east as central Turkey. The word is related to the name of the Nemetes tribe <b>living</b> by the <b>Rhine</b> between the Palatinate and Lake Constance in what is now Germany, and their goddess Nemetona.|$|R
5000|$|The Nemetes (Νεμῆται; Nemeter), {{by modern}} authors {{sometimes}} called Nemeti, were an ancient Germanic tribe <b>living</b> by the <b>Rhine</b> where Ariovistus had led them, the Suebi and other allied Germanic {{peoples in the}} second quarter of the 1st century BC. The Roman name for Speyer, Noviomagus Nemetum, reflects this city's status as the Nemetes' tribal capital. According to Tacitus, they were [...] "unquestionably Germanic". The name of the tribe, however, is Celtic as the name of its main town Noviomagus meaning noviios 'new' and magos 'plain', 'market' (cf. Old Irish mag 'plain'), as are those of a number of gods worshipped in their territory, including Nemetona, who is thought to have been their eponymous deity. Both of these names derive from the Celtic root nemeto-, referring to sacred spaces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn the {{framework}} of the <b>Rhine</b> Action <b>Programme,</b> the International <b>Rhine</b> Commission agreed on conducting regular biological inventories of the River Rhine to be held at five-year intervals, starting in 1990. The result is an ecological monitoring programme for plankton, fish fauna and benthic macrofauna prepared by research institutes of the Rhine countries. A harmonization of methods seemed imperative and for this reason a group of experts on plankton proposed a checklist of plankton species. This documentation, which gives an overview of zooplankton species commonly found in the River Rhine, will support a proper identification of River Rhine zooplankton. This working document is meant to be used when counting zooplankton samples. It should be stressed, however, that it is not meant to replace the identification documentation. For a selected group of zooplankton species, one or more photographs are shown as well as some relevant information on ecology, feeding behaviour, etc. Where essential details required for proper identification could not be shown clearly on photographs, we refer per species to the relevant literature for more detailed information. At this stage only lowland species are included. Hence, some relevant species, e. g. those typical of the Upper Rhine might be missing. Furthermore, it has not been possible to describe the distribution of species along the River Rhine to date; only for the lowland reach have some comments been given. Despite these limitations, this documentation could be a first step towards harmonization within the international biomonitoring programme of zooplankton in the River Rhine...|$|R
40|$|CATS is {{an acronym}} for Contaminants in Aquatic and Terrestrial ecoSystems. CATS models have been {{developed}} for the prediction of fate and risks of toxicants. The aim of these models is to predict future risk levels of toxic substances for food webs. CATS- 2 describes the behaviour of toxicants in sedimentation areas of main rivers in the Netherlands, such as Hollands Diep, Haringvliet and Ketelmeer. Bio-availability of toxicants to aquatic organisms is influenced by many biotic and abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem. Therefore, we integrated fate of toxicants in the abiotic environment with a food web model based on biomass cycling. Cycling of organic matter is the backbone of the model, acting as carrier for the toxicant. The food web consists of algae, zooplankton, bivalves, chironomid larvae, tubificid worms, whitefish, predatory fish, benthivorous fish, diving ducks and fish eating birds (Fig. 1). Cadmium and lindane (gamma-HCH) were selected to predict future risk levels in an example ecosystem, the Hollands Diep/Haringvliet area. Risk levels were calculated for two situations. First for the year 2000, with no additional clean-up of the river Rhine, and second for the year 2000 with additional clean-up according to the <b>Rhine</b> Action <b>Programme.</b> Model calculations predict that risks for both cadmium and lindane decrease, caused by the improvement of water quality in the River Rhine that feeds the area. The high cadmium load of the river Rhine in the past is responsible for high cadmium concentrations in the sediment. Even with additional clean up, sediment quality does not meet the Dutch quality objective of 2 mg/kg d. w. in the year 2000. Except for benthivorous fish, risks for the food web are low in the year 2000 indicating that in general the Rhine Action Plan is successful if its original emission-reduction goals can be achieved. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1895, a {{librarian}} who {{was fascinated by}} German prehistory, Gustaf Kossinna (1858 - 1931), presented a lecture in which he tried to connect the tribes who had been recorded as <b>living</b> between the <b>Rhine</b> and Vistula in 100 BCE with cultures living in that region during the Neolithic. Appointed Professor of Archaeology at the University of Berlin, in 1909 he founded the German Society for Prehistory (Vorgeschichte). He would proceed to further publicise his culture-historical approach in his subsequent books, Die Herkunft der Germanen (The Origin of the Germans), {{which was published in}} 1911, and the two-volume Ursprung und Verbreitung der Germanen (Origin and Expansion of the Germans), which was published between 1926 and 1927. A staunch nationalist and racist, Kossinna lambasted fellow German archaeologists for taking an interest in non-German societies, such as those of Egypt and the Classical World, and used his publications to support his views on German nationalism. Glorifying the German peoples of prehistory, he used an explicitly culture-historical approach in understanding them, and proclaimed that these German peoples were racially superior to their Slavic neighbours to the east.|$|R
2500|$|The major {{primary sources}} {{on the early}} Franks include the , Ammianus Marcellinus, Claudian, Zosimus, Sidonius Apollinaris and Gregory of Tours. The Franks are first {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History, a collection of biographies of the Roman emperors. The Life of Aurelian, which was possibly written by Vopiscus, mentions that in 328, Frankish raiders (possibly Ripuarians) were captured by the 6th Legion stationed at Mainz. As {{a result of this}} incident, 700 Franks were killed and 300 were sold into slavery. Frankish incursions over the Rhine became so frequent that the Romans began to settle the Franks on their borders in order to control them. In 288 the emperor Maximian defeated the Salian Franks, Chamavi, Frisians and other Germans <b>living</b> along the <b>Rhine</b> and moved them to Germania inferior to provide manpower and prevent the settlement of other Germanic tribes. In 292 Constantius, the father of Constantine I [...] defeated the Franks who had settled {{at the mouth of the}} Rhine. These were moved to the nearby region of Toxandria. Eumenius mentions Constantius as having [...] "killed, expelled, captured [...] kidnapped" [...] the Franks who had settled there and others who had crossed the Rhine, using the term [...] for the first time.|$|R
40|$|In the State Laboratory of North Rhine-Westphalia for Food, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Chemistry (Chemisches Landesuntersuchungsamt), {{more than}} 600 {{individual}} human milk samples have been analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), {{and more than}} 1400 individual milk samples have been analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) since 1984. All samples were collected {{on a voluntary basis}} from nursing mothers mostly <b>living</b> in North <b>Rhine</b> Westphalia, a federal state in Germany. The samples analyzed so far show a typical pattern of PCDDs and PCDFs. Out of the 210 possible congeners, only those with 2, 3, 7, 8 -chlorine substitution were found. While OCDD normally shows the highest concentration, the levels of the other dioxin congeners decrease with decreasing number of chlorine atoms. A different pattern was found for PCDFs. Within this group 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -P 5 CDF is the most abundant congener, followed by the hexachlorodibenzofurans. The mean level of tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) was found to be of 3. 2 pg/g on a fat basis and for total PCDDs and PCDFs, calculated as I-TEq (NATO/CMMS), 29. 3 pg/g on a fat basis. The investigations of the past 2 years have revealed somewhat lower levels compared to former years. This might be an indication that the efforts undertaken to minimize dioxin emissions and to shut down known sources have already had an effect on the body burden of humans. Although mostly banned for a considerable period of time now, some lipophilic persistent pesticides such as DDT, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) can still be found in human milk.

40|$|Abstract Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to prove the feasibility of health expectancy analyses with regional administrative health statistics and to explore the utility of the calculated health expectancies in describing the health state of the population living in North Rhine-Westphalia, a Federal State of Germany. Materials and methods Administrative population and mortality data as well as health data on disability and long-term care provided by public services were used to calculate: a) the life expectancy and b) the health expectancies Severe-Disability-Free Life Expectancy (SDFLE) and Long-Term-Care-Free Life Expectancy (LTCFLE) from 1999 to 2005. Calculations were done using the Sullivan method. Results SDFLE at birth was 69. 9 years (males 66. 2 and females 73. 2 years) in 1999 and it increased to 71. 7 years (males 68. 6 and females 74. 7 years) in 2005. The proportion of the SDFLE on the total life expectancy at birth was 89. 8 % (males 88. 6 and females 90. 8 %) in 1999 and 90. 7 % (males 89. 8 and females 91. 4 %) in 2005. LTCFLE at birth was 75. 3 years (males 73. 1 and females 77. 5 years) in 1999 and it increased to 76. 6 years (males 74. 7 and females 78. 6 years) in 2005. The proportion of the LTCFLE on the total life expectancy at birth was 96. 8 % (males 97. 8 and females 96. 1 %) in 1999 and 96. 8 % (males 97. 8 and females 96. 2 %) in 2005. Discussion and conclusion Both health expectancies indicate an improvement in the quantity {{as well as in the}} quality of healthy life for the population <b>living</b> in North <b>Rhine</b> Westphalia and therefore suggest a compression of morbidity from 1999 to 2005. The findings however have several limitations in their sensitivity, since we applied dichotomous valuations to the health states. In addition, the results are restricted to comparisons over time because the morbidity concepts do not allow for comparisons with populations other than the German one. Refined calculations with other summary measures of population health and with health data on other morbidity concepts are therefore reasonable. </p...|$|R
