5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In <b>lungfishes,</b> bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. <b>Lungfishes</b> do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Suggestions by {{palaeontologist}} John A. Long {{refer to}} a close phylogenetic relationship between Onychodus and the basal lobe-finned fish Psarolepis from China. It is generally acknowledged that Onychodus and Psarolepis are both basal bony fishes, because {{of the absence of}} major features that unite coelacanths, <b>lungfishes</b> and tetrapod-like lobe-finned fishes. The position of Onychodus and Psarolepis in the cladogram is outside the major clade of sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fishes), but at a position more derived than actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes).|$|E

50|$|Unlike most fossil <b>lungfish,</b> but again, like modern South American and African <b>lungfish,</b> gnathorhizids have bladelike toothplates. This {{suggests}} gnathorhizids {{were active}} predators unlike most <b>lungfish,</b> which feed primarily on benthic invertebrates.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{shape and size}} of the stomach varies widely among {{different}} vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, <b>lungfishes,</b> and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the anus. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.|$|E
500|$|Bowfin, {{like other}} physostomes such as bichirs (Polypteridae), gars (Lepisosteidae), and the <b>lungfishes</b> (Dipnoi), {{are capable of}} bimodal respiration. [...] They can extract oxygen from the water when {{breathing}} through their gills, and can also break the water's surface to breathe or gulp air through a small pneumatic duct connected from their foregut to the gas bladder. When performing low-level physical activity, bowfin obtain {{more than half of}} their oxygen from breathing air. [...] Bowfin have two distinct air-breathing mechanisms used to ventilate the gas bladder. Type I air breaths are consistent with the action of exhale-inhale stimulated by aerial or aquatic hypoxia to regulate O2 gas exchange; type II air breaths are by inhalation alone which is believed to regulate gas bladder volume for buoyancy control. Bimodal respiration helps bowfin survive and maintain their metabolic rate in hypoxic conditions. The rate of air breathing is higher in darkness, when the fish is more active.|$|E
2500|$|The coelacanth, {{which is}} related to <b>lungfishes</b> and tetrapods, was {{believed}} to have been extinct {{since the end of the}} Cretaceous period. More closely related to tetrapods than to the ray-finned fish, coelacanths were considered transitional species between fish and tetrapods. On 23 December 1938, the first Latimeria specimen was found off the east coast of South Africa, off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa). Museum curator Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen. A Rhodes University ichthyologist, J. L. B.

40|$|The first {{vertebrates}} {{recognizable as}} tetrapods {{appeared in the}} mid-Devonian. It is generally agreed that their ancestors were lobe-finned fish. What is not agreed is how close either of the extant groups of lobe-finned fish, <b>lungfish</b> or coelacanths, is to the actual ancestor of the tetrapods. The soft anatomy of living <b>lungfish</b> shares many similarities with that of living amphibians. Many of these similarities are not present in either coelacanths or any members of the other extant bony fish group, the ray-finned fishes. Many very well preserved <b>lungfish</b> from the Devonian possess specialized features that would appear to exclude them from being ancestral to tetrapods. I am hypothesizing that <b>lungfish</b> in the Devonian may have included metamorphosis in their life cycle and that neoteny in some species {{may have been an}} early corollary. These reproductively mature neotenous <b>lungfish</b> would not have had the specialised features of metamorphosed adults. Fossils of these neotenous forms may have more closely resembled the tetrapod ancestral lobe-finned fish, currently believed to be a panderichthiad fish. Living <b>lungfish</b> have a number of larval features, which suggest paedomorphosis. Also of significance is the very large genome of living <b>lungfish,</b> which, in urodele amphibians, is a feature correlated with neoteny. Our current knowledge of the thyroid axis in the <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsteri, is consistent with neoteny in amphibians, but the only Devonian fossil considered to be a larval <b>lungfish</b> bears no resemblance to living <b>lungfish</b> or to panderichthiads.

Proposed mitigation strategies include fish transfer facilities, provision of flow releases from the dam (environmental flows) to sustain <b>lungfish</b> habitat and breeding downstream, and translocation of hatchery-reared juvenile <b>lungfish</b> into suitable natural habitats.
