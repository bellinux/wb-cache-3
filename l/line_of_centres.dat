S1 is small as it passes through the hole between A, B and C, and grows till it becomes a plane tangent to them. The centre of inversion is now also with a point of tangency with the image of S6, so it is also a plane tangent to A, B and C. As S1 proceeds, its concavity is reversed and now it surrounds all the other spheres, tangent to A, B, C, S2 and S6. S2 pushes upwards and grows to become a tangent plane and S6 shrinks. S1 then obtains S6's former position as a tangent plane. It then reverses concavity again and passes through the hole again, beginning another round trip.

In Lophelia pertusa <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> calcification are large (50 µm) and arranged in <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> calcification. Our results show that <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> calcification in Lophelia pertusa have a restricted range of variation in d 18 O (- 2. 8 ± 0. 3 ‰ (V-PDB)), and a larger range in d 13 C (14. 3 to 10. 9 ‰ (V-PDB)).

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of a numerical {{investigation of the}} dynamics and geometry of accretion discs in binary systems with mass ratios q < 0. 1, applicable to ultra-compact X-ray binaries, AM CVn stars and very short period cataclysmic variables. The steady-state geometry of the disc in the binary reference frame {{is found to be}} quite different from that expected at higher mass ratios. For q ~ 0. 1, the disc takes on the usual elliptical shape, with the major axis aligned perpendicular to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> of the two stars. However, at smaller mass ratios the elliptical gaseous orbits in the outer regions of the disc are rotated in the binary plane. The angle of rotation increases with gas temperature, but is found to vary inversely with q. At q = 0. 01, the major axis of these orbits is aligned almost parallel to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> of the two stars. These effects may be responsible for the similar disc structure inferred from Doppler tomography of the AM CVn star GP Com (Morales-Rueda et al. 2003), which has q = 0. 02. The steady-state geometry at low mass ratios is not predicted by an inviscid, restricted three-body model of gaseous orbits; it is related to the effects of tidal-viscous truncation of the disc near the Roche lobe boundary. Since the disc geometry can be inferred observationally for some systems, it is proposed that this may offer a useful diagnostic for the determination of mass ratios in ultra-compact binaries.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{analysis}} of the published long-term photometric observations has revealed permanent active-longitude structures in four RS CVn stars: EI Eri, II Peg, σ Gem, and HR 7275. Two active longitudes separated by half of the period are found to dominate on the surface during all available seasons. The positions of the longitudes on three stars (EI Eri, II Peg, HR 7275) are migrating in the orbital reference frame, {{and there is no}} preferred orientation with respect to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> in the binaries. The rate of migration is approximately constant. In case of σ Gem the active longitude migration is synchronized with the orbital motion {{in the direction of the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> in the binary. The active region lifetimes can be longer than the time span of the observations (≥ 15 yr). The periods of the active longitude rotation are determined: for EI Eri 1. d 9510, for II Peg 6. d 7066, for σ Gem 19. d 604, for HR 7275 28. d 263. Long-term activity cycles of the stars are discovered from the {{analysis of}} the relative contribution of the two longitudes to the photometric variability. One longitude is found to be usually more active than the other at a given moment, and the change of the activity level between the longitudes is cyclic with periods of years. The switch of the activity takes a much shorter time, about a few months, similar to the “flip-flop ” phenomenon found for FK Com stars. Moments of switching are regarded as new tracers of the activity, and total cycles, which return activity to the same longitude, are found to be for EI Eri 9. 0 yr, for II Pe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{fundamental}} theorem which automatically {{transforms the}} solution {{due to the}} presence of an arbitrary axisymmetric singularity in an unbounded homogeneous isotropic elastic solid into the corresponding solution for two perfectly bonded isotropic semi-infinite elastic solids is systematically applied in a stepwise fashion to obtain the complete image system when an arbitrary axisymmetric singularity is operative in or near a thick elastic layer which separates two other dissimilar isotropic semi-infinite elastic solids. The solution is closed and well structured. As an illustration, the distant effect in the interface layer produced by an influencing normal point force is luminously revealed to be two-dimensional, consisting of a combination at the origin of a bending hot spot and an infinite <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> of dilatation. We conclude the paper with a complete theory of images for a free elastic layer under the influence of both axisymmetric and asymmetric singularities.

By accurately evaluating the singular integrals arising from the discretization of the resulting integral equation, one can efficiently and accurately treat flow problems with high α defined by rs/K 1 / 2 p in which rs is the radius of the sphere and Kp is the Darcy permeability.
