5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>LPG),</b> or hydrogen.|$|E

The coverage of water supply in major towns has reach 100% while in rural areas, the coverage still around 75% with total public pipes length up to 15,031 kilometres. The only water supply dam in the state is the Babagon Dam which holds 21,000 million litres of water. To meet the increase demands, another dam named as Kaiduan Dam was being proposed to be built although being met with protest from local villagers who living on the proposed site.

As Malaysia's <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>LPG)</b> are much cheaper through the subsidy that was given by the federal government, it was found out in 2015 that around 20,000 LPG cylinders in Sabah east coast were smuggled by immigrants from neighbouring Indonesia and the southern Philippines in a monthly basis to their countries that leading to many Sabahans hard to retrieve enough supplies of LPG. As a counter-measure, the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCAC) has temporarily cancelled all permits to sell gas cylinders into neighbouring countries with a new policy will be implemented to control such illegal activities.|$|E

25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>LPG)</b> has {{an overall}} lower power output at the typical 10:1 {{compression}} ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel.

40|$|Objectives: The study {{objective}} was to assemble emission characteristics {{of the sources of}} the ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and to elaborate methods of organizing them into the sources’ chemical profiles.

Results: The method enabled to assess VOC emissions from the typically distributed sources existing in urban environment and VOC occurrences characterizing the local, or point-like, sources. The distributed sources were inextricably associated with hydrocarbons from exhaust, heavier hydrocarbons from contaminated urban soil, fugitive evaporations of gasoline and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>LPG),</b> leakage from the industrial and commercial use of solvents, and the inert, ozone depleting gases permeating urban atmosphere.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) simulation {{has been carried}} out to study the fuel and air mixing characteristics of a low pressure domestic gas appliance. Three types of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>LPG),</b> namely pure propane, pure butane and a mixture (by weight) of 30 % propane and 70 % butane, were simulated at a fuel pressure of 300 mm WG. The CFD results show that for the same fuel supply pressure and gas orifice size, the mass flow rate of LPG fuel discharged into a burner was proportionate to its specific gravity. However, as compared to butane and LPG mixture, the propane fuel discharge velocity was the highest due to its lowest specific gravity. This subsequently produced the most negative static pressure values at a burner mixing tube throat and hence allowing the largest amount of primary air to be induced into an appliance. The amount of primary air required to initiate combustion by propane, LPG mixture and butane fuels was predicted to be approximately 72 %, 61 % and 54 % of stoichiometric requirement, respectively. These values are in good agreement with a typical range of primary air requirement for this type of atmospheric burner. The mixing rates of propane-air system were predicted to be much faster than that of LPG mixture-air and butane-air systems. However, for all three types of LPG fuel, the fuel and air mixing was found to be almost complete in the second mixing tube. In addition, the average mass fraction of fuel at a burner input was predicted to be almost identical to that of burner outlet, thus demonstrating a fully-premixed capability of this type of atmospheric gas appliance...|$|R

40|$|For almost 4 decades, {{underground}} caverns in {{hard rock}} {{have been used}} to store <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>LPG)</b> and refrigerated products, such as foods and chemicals. The design of such facilities has, however, been founded on relatively limited knowledge of the reaction of rock masses to cooling. This lack of knowledge may be detrimental to the safe containment and stability of the cavern. According to the available experience, it is clear that one of the key issues in designing unlined caverns for low temperature products is an understanding of the disturbance in the rock fracture network. Increasing aperture and prolongation of fractures inevitably affect the rock mass stability, the heat loss from stored products, and the risk for ice growth from water invading the cavern. The objective of the work presented here was to increase the knowledge of the mechanical and physical phenomena in a rock mass subjected to low temperatures, to enable a more reliable prediction of the behaviour of refrigerated caverns in hard rock. This thesis includes a literature survey, laboratory and field tests, prediction of behaviour and a comparative analysis. The main investigation was performed in a pilot scale cavern in hard rock, constructed as a vertical cylinder with a diameter of 7 m and a height of 15 m.

The temperature in the cavern was decreased in steps down to - 40 °C, with monitoring of relative humidity, air and rock temperatures, rock strain and fracture aperture, cavern convergence and rock mass deformation.
