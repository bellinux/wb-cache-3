40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to illustrate some new fitting techniques for the upper extremity amputee using two types of custom silicone <b>liners</b> manufactured at the Bloorview MacMillan Children’s Centre in Toronto. The need for custom silicone <b>liners</b> for upper extremity clients was discovered with the attempted fitting of off-the-shelf silicone <b>liners.</b> These <b>liners</b> {{were not able to}} provide a total contact fit. Many of the prosthetic clients at the Centre have various levels of amputation that are congenital in nature. With the wide variety of shapes (and sizes) presented by our client’s residual limbs custom silicone <b>liners</b> were indicated over off-the-shelf <b>liners.</b> Two techniques for fabricating custom silicone <b>liners</b> have been developed at the BMCC. The two fabricating procedures are described as custom injected and custom rolled silicone <b>liners.</b> There are advantages and disadvantages to both techniques. Both of these techniques offer greater accuracy in achieving total contact suction suspension for the upper extremity amputee regardless of the complexity of the limb presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} Low-ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (<b>LINERs)</b> {{has been an}} open {{question}} for a long time. We study the properties of <b>LINERs</b> from several different aspects. The <b>LINERs</b> are found to consist of two different categories that can be clearly separated in the traditional BPT diagrams, especially in the [O I]/Hα vs. [O III]/Hβ diagram. <b>LINERs</b> with high [O I]/Hα ratios (population I) differ from ones with low ratios (population II) in several properties. Broad emission lines are only identified in the spectra of population I <b>LINERs.</b> While only the population II <b>LINERs</b> show luminous infrared emission and occurrence of core-collapse supernovae in the host. Combining these results with the known distribution of stellar populations not only suggests that the two populations have different line excitation mechanisms, but also implies that they are at different evolutionary stages...|$|R

The engines feature an aluminum engine block with siamesed cast iron cylinder <b>liners</b> (that is cylinder <b>liners</b> that don't allow coolant to flow between adjacent <b>liners).</b> By using cylinder <b>liners</b> the engine's bore can be altered, therefore the displacement as well, just by adding a different set of cylinder <b>liners.</b> The engine also features an aluminum cylinder head with double overhead camshafts and variable valve timing.|$|R
