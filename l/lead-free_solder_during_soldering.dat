30|$|The strong {{effect of}} PAni in the {{prevention}} of Cu oxidation has been published by us many years ago [9] and is in commercial use since almost 10 years in a process for finishing printed circuit boards and providing solderability after storage and thermal ageing. Here, a PAni 1 -water dispersion is used as the Cu surface preparation “predip” prior to an electroless Sn deposition [10]. In the meantime this process is well established and widely used in the printed circuit board industry as one of the alternative finishes which are required for the <b>lead-free</b> electronics manufacturing (<b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>during</b> the assembly of PCBs with the necessary electronics components). In this process (ORMECON CSN) the PAni predip is applied forming an about 80 nm thin adsorbed layer which results in the formation of selectively Cu(+ 1) and a passivation of Cu, in addition, it takes part as a catalyst to provide electrons for Sn(2 +) which is subsequently deposited onto the Cu.|$|R
40|$|Solder thermal {{interface}} {{materials are}} often used in power semiconductors to enhance heat dissipation from silicon die to the heat spreader. Nonetheless, the presence of voids in the die bond layer impedes heat flow and thus increases the chip junction temperature. Such voids which form easily in the <b>solder</b> joint <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow process at manufacturing stage are primarily occasioned by out-gassing phenomenon. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> void percentages and configurations on packaged semiconductor device. The thermal resistance for each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the resultant electronic package.

The focus {{of this paper is}} to present experimental results of a comprehensive study of the interfacial reactions <b>during</b> <b>soldering</b> of Sn-Ag-Cu <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> on copper (Cu), immersion silver (ImAg), electroless nickel/ immersion gold (ENIG) and electroless nickel/ electroless palladium/ immersion gold (ENEPIG) surface finishes. Using scanning electron microscopy detailed a study of the 3 -D morphology and grain size of the intermetallics was conducted. The results showed that when soldering on ENIG and ENEPIG finishes several morphologies of intermetallics with different grain sizes form at the solder joint interface compared to a single intermetallic morphology that forms when soldering on copper and immersion silver. An attempt was made to discuss the effect of several factors that may have an influence on the type of morphology the intermetallics may grow into.

40|$|Abstract. Sn-based <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> {{have some}} {{characteristics}} {{that are different}} from the conventionally used Sn-Pb eutectic. One is the high dissolution rate of metals and alloys into molten <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Several problems due to this high dissolution rate were reviewed. The prominent materials that suffered from this high dissolution rate are copper and iron based. High dissolution rate of Cu resulted in thick Cu-Sn intermetallic compound formation <b>during</b> <b>soldering</b> and Cu enrichment in wave soldering bath. The iron-based materials used for soldering equipments are damaged by erosion. Suppression of the dissolution rate is important to secure quality of micro-soldered joints, to prevent contamination of solder bath and to prolong the life of soldering equipments.

The {{content of the}} RE element is 2, 5 wt. %, respectively. The RE elements are stored as island compounds in the solder matrix and their addition has {{little effect on the}} melting point of the Sn-Ag solder.

While soldering at 300 degrees C, the IMC layer become continuous and stronger bonding strength is obtained. The addition of 5 wt. % RE can result in higher bonding strength than that of 2 wt. % RE. In the present research work, we find that in order to get strong bonding between the Si substrate and the composite solders, suitable pressure should be employed to overcome the oxide skin of the liquid <b>solders</b> formed <b>during</b> <b>soldering.</b> The interfacial structure and fracture analysis of the solder joints are investigated to reveal the bonding nature.

In this study, the intermetallic-growth rate, morphology, and kinetics were examined in a Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder reflowed on Cu. The joints were cooled in water, air, or furnace conditions. Solder aging was conducted at 100 °C, 140 °C, and 175 °C and aged for 0 – 1, 000 h. Cooling rate and aging temperature played an important role on microstruc-ture evolution and growth kinetics of Cu 6 Sn 5 (η) and Cu 3 Sn (ε) intermetallic layers. Faster cooling rates resulted in a relatively planar Cu 6 Sn 5 layer, while a nodular Cu 6 Sn 5 morphology was present for slower cooling. Inter-metallic-growth rate measurements indicated a mixed growth mechanism of grain-boundary and bulk diffusion. These mechanisms are discussed in terms of the initial intermetallic thickness and morphology controlled by cooling rate, diffusion kinetics, and the competition between Cu 6 Sn 5 and Cu 3 Sn growth...|$|R

In order {{to predict the}} solder joint reliability under drop conditions, {{it is important to}} increase the testing speed of package level test methods, such as high-speed solder ball shear and pull. Traditional ball shear and pull tests are not considered suitable for evaluation of joint reliability under drop loading, since the applied test speeds, usually lower than 5 mm/s, are well below the impact velocity applied to the solder joint in a drop test. Recently, high-speed shear and pull test equipment (Dage 4000 HS) with testing speeds beyond 1, 000 mm/s has become available. The present study continues the efforts reported recently and investigates the effect of thermal aging on the attachment strength and fracture energy of SnAgCu <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> balls <b>during</b> high speed ball shear/pull tests. The ball shear test speeds ranged from 100 mm/s to 1, 000 mm/s, while the ball pull test speeds ranged from 5 mm/s to 100 mm/s.

In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT).

Issues addressed in this study include using VFM to reduce the solder reflow temperature, comparing the heating rate of different size solder particles, and comparing the reliability of VFM reflowed solder versus conventionally reflowed solder. Results comparing the effect of particle size on the heating rate of solder showed that the differences were negligible. This {{is due in part to}} the particle sizes overlapping. Many <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> pastes reflow around 250 ℃. Results indicate that when using the VFM, <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste will reflow at 220 ℃. The reliability of solder that was reflowed using the VFM at the reduced temperature was found to be comparable to solder reflowed in a conventional manner. Based on these findings, VFM processing can eliminate the major obstacles to making <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste a more attractive option for use in the microelectronics industry. M. S.

40|$|This master's thesis {{deals with}} issue of <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> in {{protective}} atmosphere with focus on wetting test. Theorethical part {{is focused on}} the types of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> wettability tests performed on solder joints, different types of soldering or comparison of influence of the base material in regards to the wetting of the solder. The goal of practical part is testing and comparison of spreadability of selected <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> on two conductive surfaces with different concentration of oxygen in protective nitrogen atmosphere. Testing has been performed on ceramic substrate which differs this method from others, performed on organic substrate. For an over-melted solder, the crystal-growth on surface in regards to protective atmosphere concentration is shown...|$|R
