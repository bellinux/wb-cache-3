25|$|Even summer {{can have}} its problems. A light rain shower {{following}} {{a long period}} of dry weather can sometimes cause similar low adhesion conditions to those of <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> contamination. Although the effect is only short term, its unpredictability can cause a significant incident to occur. A morning dew can have the same effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|E

25|$|Prior to each <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> season many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion {{training for}} their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over {{a section of}} line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full Service brake under normal adhesion conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the train sliding, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater.|$|E
25|$|The amount, {{structure}} and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and {{in various parts}} of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at <b>leaf</b> <b>fall.</b>|$|E
25|$|Host {{plants that}} are taxonomically related show more similar EcM fungal {{communities}} than do taxa that are more distantly related. Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} fungi derived from a common ancestor are more likely to show host specificity to {{plants that are}} taxonomically related. Host successional status may also play a role in determining EcM fungal communities, as well as affecting the number of EcM fungal species associated with an individual host species. Other indirect factors can also {{play a role in the}} EcM fungal community, such as <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> and litter quality, which subsequently affect calcium levels and soil pH. Even establishment timeframe of the host species can have an effect, with lower EcM fungal richness associated with hosts from a secondary forest than from a primary forest.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>leaf</b> <b>fall</b> season {{causes the}} most {{disruption}} to rail operations.

[...] If the climate is damp, the wet leaves adhere to the rail very effectively. [...] The draft caused by {{the passage of the}} train causes nearby leaves to be caught up in air currents, and more leaves are deposited on the railhead. The build up of this material is incremental, and it is hard enough not to be quickly worn away by the ordinary passage of trains.|$|E

An English wood, if left to itself, would be cumbered with fallen timber; and one has heard of forests in North America, through which it is all but {{impossible}} to make way, so high are piled up, among the still- growing trees, dead logs in every stage of decay.

One has heard often enough of bison-hunting in Himalayan forests among Deodaras one hundred and fifty feet high, and scarlet Rhododendrons thirty feet high, growing in fifteen or twenty feet of leaf-and-timber mould.

Long and fiercely, three times over, Thor drank; but made hardly any impression. He was a weak child, they told him: could he lift that Cat he saw there? Small as the feat seemed, Thor with his whole godlike strength could not; he bent up the creature's back, could not raise its feet off the ground, could at the utmost raise one foot. Why, you are no man, said the Utgard people; there is an Old Woman that will wrestle you! Thor, heartily ashamed, seized this haggard Old Woman; but could not throw her.|$|E
