40|$|Artificial telluric {{currents}} leaked {{from the}} DC electric railway are often unwanted noise sources in electromagnetic surveys. In {{order to examine}} characteristics of such noise sources we calculate the <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> from the DC electric railway using a simplified model, comparing it with observed <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> Observations of <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> were carried out at nine sites around Koka town, Siga prefecture. Preferred orientations of the <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> were examined at each site distributed along a measuring line perpendicular to a DC electric railway. It is concluded that theoretical values for the <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> are roughly explainable for some characteristics of the <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> observed...|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} scales, subthreshold <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> grow exponentially {{and become}} an increasingly large component of total power disscation. CAD tools to help model and manage subthreshold <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> will be needed for developing ultra low power and high performance integrated circuits. This paper gives an overview of current research to control <b>leakage</b> <b>currents,</b> {{with an emphasis on}} areas where CAD improvements will be needed. The first part of the paper explores techniques to model subthreshold <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> at the device, circuit, and system levels.

40|$|Degradation of <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> {{is often}} {{observed}} during life testing of tantalum capacitors and is sometimes {{attributed to the}} field-induced crystallization in amorphous anodic tantalum pentoxide dielectrics. However, degradation of <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> {{and the possibility of}} annealing of degraded capacitors have not been investigated yet. In this work the effect of annealing after highly accelerated life testing (HALT) on <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> in various types of solid tantalum capacitors was analyzed. Variations of <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> with time during annealing at temperatures from 125 oC to 180 oC, thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD) currents, and I-V characteristics were measured to understand the conduction mechanism and the reason for current degradation. Annealing resulted in a gradual decrease of <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> and restored their initial values.

25|$|The <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> {{drops in}} the first minutes after {{applying}} DC voltage. In this time the dielectric oxide layer can repair all weaknesses by building up new layers in a self-healing process. The time it takes <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> to drop generally depends {{on the kind of}} electrolyte. Solid electrolytes' <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> drops much faster than in the case of non-solid types, but it remain at a somewhat higher level. Wet electrolytic capacitors with high water contend electrolytes {{in the first}} minutes generally have higher <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> than those with organic electrolyte, but after several minutes they reach the same level. Although the <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> of electrolytic capacitors is higher compared with the current flow over the insulation resistance at ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors can take several weeks.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of {{insulation}} resistance (IR) in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) {{is considered a}} screening technique that ensures the dielectric is defect-free. This work analyzes {{the effectiveness of this}} technique for revealing cracks in ceramic capacitors. It is shown that absorption currents prevail over the intrinsic <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> during standard IR measurements at room temperature. Absorption currents, and consequently IR, have a weak temperature dependence, increase linearly with voltage (before saturation), and are not sensitive to the presence of mechanical defects. In contrary, intrinsic <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> increase super-linearly with voltage and exponentially with temperature (activation energy is in the range from 0. 6 eV to 1. 1 eV). <b>Leakage</b> <b>currents</b> associated with the presence of cracks have a weaker dependence on temperature and voltage compared to the intrinsic <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> For this reason, intrinsic <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> prevail at high temperatures and voltages, thus masking the presence of defects...|$|R

40|$|<b>Leakage</b> <b>currents</b> in AlGaN Schottky diodes were {{investigated}} systematically {{by using a}} rigorous computer simulation based on the thin surface barrier model taking account of unintentionally doped surface donors. The <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> in AlGaN Schottky diodes have stronger bias dependence and smaller temperature dependences as {{compared with those of}} GaN diodes. It was shown that these features were associated with shallow oxygen donors located near the AlGaN surface. Then, an attempt was made to remove oxygen and suppress <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> by a surface control process using an ultrathin Al layer and subsequent annealing. An in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated the formation of Al 2 O 3 layer during the surface control process, suggesting efficient gettering of oxygen from the surface. C-V analysis directly indicated the reduction of shallow donors by the surface control process. A remarkable reduction of reverse <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> of four to five orders of magnitude took place in large area AlGaN Schottky diodes after the application of the surface control process.

30|$|To {{achieve a}} high {{capacitance}} density for embedded decoupling capacitor applications, the aerosol deposition (AD) process was applied as {{a thin film}} deposition process. BaTiO 3 films were fabricated on Cu substrates by the AD process at room temperature, and the film thickness was reduced to confirm the limit of the critical minimum thickness for dielectric properties. As a result, the BaTiO 3 thin films that were less than 1 -μm thick showed unstable electric properties owing to their high <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> Therefore, to overcome this problem, {{the causes of the}} high <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> were investigated. In this study, it was confirmed that by comparing BaTiO 3 thin films on Cu substrates with those on stainless steels (SUS) substrates, macroscopic defects and rough interfaces between films and substrates influence the <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> Moreover, based on the deposition mechanism of the AD process, it was considered that the BaTiO 3 thin films on Cu substrates with thicknesses of less than 1 μm are formed with chinks and weak particle-to-particle bonding, giving rise to <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> In order to confirm the relation between the above-mentioned surface morphologies and the dielectric behavior, the hardness of BaTiO 3 films on Cu and SUS substrates was investigated by nano-indentation. Consequently, we proposed that the chinks and weak particle-to-particle bonding in the BaTiO 3 thin films with thicknesses of less than 0.5 μm on Cu substrates could be the main cause of the high <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
