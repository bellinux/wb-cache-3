500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Fall Out Boy began searching for {{potential}} producers. The band sought out R singer/producer Babyface, as they admired {{his work on}} the soundtrack to the 2001 film version of Josie and the Pussycats.

Babyface produced two of the songs, [...] "I'm Like a <b>Lawyer</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous album, handled production for eleven of Infinity on Highs fourteen tracks. Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by Avron. This period included both rehearsals and writing, as well as working out all the sounds and arrangements. It began in Chicago before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in Los Angeles. Additionally, some rough recordings of songs were created {{to be used in the}} studio as a future reference.|$|E
500|$|The saucer in the {{original}} game design {{was supposed to take}} a shot as soon as it appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to [...] "lurking" [...] from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could [...] "hide" [...] {{at the opposite end of}} the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an EPROM restricting such chances. Usage of the names of Saturday Night Live characters [...] "Mr. Bill" [...] and [...] "Sluggo" [...] to refer to the saucers in an Esquire article about the game led to Logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a <b>lawyer</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Mr. Bill Trademark." ...|$|E

500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] Take This to Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a <b>Lawyer</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what the boys have become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E

2500|$|The Russian {{newspaper}} Kommersant nevertheless {{reported that}} Snowden was {{living at the}} Russian consulate shortly before his departure from Hong Kong to Moscow.

They haven't been able to, because it's false." [...] Likewise rejecting the Kommersant story was Anatoly Kucherena, who became Snowden's lawyer in July 2013 when Snowden asked him for help in seeking temporary asylum in Russia. Kucherena said Snowden did not communicate with Russian diplomats while he was in Hong Kong. In early September 2013, however, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that, a few days before boarding a plane to Moscow, Snowden met in Hong Kong with Russian diplomatic representatives.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the mean}} time the party bound for Orley Farm had reached that place, and to them also came the {{necessity}} of wearing through that tedious evening. On the mind of Lucius Mason not even yet had a shadow of suspicion fallen. To him, in spite of it all, his mother was still pure. But yet he was stern to her, and his manner was very harsh. It may be that had such suspicion crossed his mind {{he would have been}} less stern, and his manner more tender. As it was he could understand nothing that was going on, and almost felt that he was kept in the dark at his mother's instance. Why was it that a man respected by all the world, such as Sir Richard Leatherham, should rise in court and tell such a tale as that against his mother; and that the power of answering that tale on his mother's behalf should be left to such another man as Mr. Chaffanbrass? Sir Richard had told his story plainly, but with terrible force; whereas Chaffanbrass had contented himself with brow-beating another <b>lawyer</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest quirks of his cunning.
