5|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the <b>landscape,</b> <b>to</b> affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage {{for the rest of the}} lemmings.|$|E
5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant. His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> check the location of previously recorded sites and discover new ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map. Based on his research in this region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Friedrich's {{patriotism and}} resentment during the 1813 French {{occupation}} of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He {{was impressed by the}} anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in the history of art.|$|E

5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to put out the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR <b>Landscape</b> <b>to</b> restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the town the area was covered by temperate coniferous forests (mostly pine and fir) with an admixture of broad-leaved trees and fens. The soils were mostly podzol, combined with peat and gleysols. Intensive economic activities changed the original forest <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> agricultural land with small groves of aspen, birch, alder and willow. In the 18–19th centuries, a large park area of almost 600 hectares (Pavlovsk and Arensky parks) has been created in and around the city.|$|E
25|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is currently}} the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' habitat may alter the fitness <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> {{such an extent that}} the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming toxic, or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.|$|E

One incident in particular involving miners from Montana traveling through Cache Valley was enough to justify an expedition to investigate the situation further. Eager for combat, Connor marched his regiment 140 miles over the frozen winter <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> deal with the Indians. On January 29, 1863, Connor's troops encountered the Shoshoni encampment along the Bear River. His men massacred the Indian encampment and then marched back to Utah.|$|E

25|$|Most early landscapes {{are clearly}} imaginary, {{although}} from {{very early on}} townscape views are clearly intended to represent actual cities, {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy. Various techniques were used to simulate the randomness of natural forms in invented compositions: the medieval advice of Cennino Cennini to copy ragged crags from small rough rocks was apparently followed by both Poussin and Thomas Gainsborough, while Degas copied cloud forms from a crumpled handkerchief held up against the light. The system of Alexander Cozens used random ink blots to give the basic shape of an invented <b>landscape,</b> <b>to</b> be elaborated by the artist.|$|E
25|$|During hibernation, Indiana bats occupy open {{areas of}} hibernacula {{ceilings}} and generally avoid crevices and other enclosed areas. Indiana bats {{were associated with}} hibernacula that were long (µ=2,817 feet (858 m)), had high ceilings (µ=15 feet (4.5 m)), and had large entrances (µ=104.4 feet² (9.7 m²)). The preferred hibernacula often had multiple entrances promoting airflow. Hibernacula choice {{may be influenced by}} the ability of the outside <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> provide adequate forage upon arrival at the hibernacula as well as the specific microclimate inside. Having forested areas around the hibernacula entrance and low amounts of open farmland may be important factors influencing the suitability of hibernacula.|$|E
25|$|According to Kelly's theory, {{the manner}} of {{accessing}} stored information would depend on whether the culture was mobile or more settled. Hunter-gatherer societies would depend on portable mnemonic devices and techniques {{that would allow them}} to use the landscape as a mnemonic tool, such as the method of loci. Kelly has observed similar techniques within the modern Australian Aborigines, who use features on the landscape as visual cues to retrieve information. On the other hand, societies that were less mobile but not completely settled would create local replications of the <b>landscape</b> <b>to</b> access information, such as circles of timber or stone, sequences of mounds and other prehistoric built environments.|$|E
