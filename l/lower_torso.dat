Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of matted hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his <b>lower</b> <b>torso,</b> below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with {{ornaments}} and jewellery. Between them stands a gana (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In the lower left of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in namaste posture representing the heroic mythical king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.|$|E

Bra or bikini-like garments are depicted on some female athletes in the 14th century BC during the Minoan civilization era. From the 14th century onward, the undergarments of wealthier women in the Western world were dominated by the corset, which pushed the breasts upwards.

40|$|Wind is {{fundamentally}} important to cyclists since it affects their performance, bicycle control, balance and road safety. The overall {{aim of this}} research is to improve the understanding of the effect of cycling position and crosswinds on the aerodynamics and performance of a cyclist. The first part of this thesis focuses on cycling position. To minimise air resistance, cyclists <b>lower</b> their <b>torso</b> to become more aerodynamic. Results show that <b>lowering</b> <b>torso</b> angle is associated with impairment of physiological functioning, which can be explained by a combination of mechanical and muscular factors. Consequently, there is a trade-off between aerodynamic gains and physiological impairment. Therefore a mathematical model has been developed predicting the optimal torso angle at different cycling speeds. The second part of this thesis aims to understand the flow mechanics around a cyclist subjected to crosswinds. Both wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow around a cyclist are used to reveal the effect of crosswinds on cyclists in different cycling positions. This thesis provides a unique approach to study cycling performance and safety by jointly investigating the human physiology and aerodynamic performance...|$|R

The activity usually linked with Islamic ziyarat pilgrimage to historical Islamic sites, such as historical mosques and tombs of venerated Islamic figures. However, for visitors in Islamic sites, either local or foreign, Muslim or non-Muslim, the rules of conduct and dress modesty is applied, such as removing the footwear while entering mosques or makam (tombs), visitor should not entering the site wearing shorts (sarong usually lent near the entrance to cover <b>lower</b> <b>torso</b> of the visitors), and wearing kerudung (head-dress covering) for women.|$|E
25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and <b>lower</b> <b>torso,</b> never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E

Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and falsies). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim <b>lower</b> <b>torso,</b> reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie.

50|$|Bowing (also called stooping) is {{the act of}} <b>lowering</b> the <b>torso</b> {{and head}} as a social gesture in {{direction}} to another person or symbol.

It is also used in religious contexts, as a form of worship or veneration. Sometimes the gesture may be limited to lowering the head such as in Indonesia, and in many cultures several degrees of the lowness of the bow are distinguished and regarded as appropriate for different circumstances. It is especially prominent in India, Thailand, Laos, China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam where it may be executed standing or kneeling. Some bows are performed equally by two or more people while others are unequal - the person bowed to either does not bow in return or performs a less low bow in response. A nod of the head may be regarded as the minimal form of bow; forms of kneeling, genuflection, or prostration which involves the hands or whole body touching the ground, are the next levels of gesture.|$|R

Odissi is learnt and performed as a composite of basic dance motif called the Bhangas (symmetric body bends, stance). It involves <b>lower</b> (footwork), mid (<b>torso)</b> and upper (hand and head) as three sources of perfecting expression and audience engagement with geometric symmetry and rhythmic musical resonance.

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{functional}} anatomy of the lymphatic vessels draining the skin. To address this issue, we previously created a three-dimensional computer model of skin lymphatic drainage, using melanoma lymphoscintigraphy (LS) data from 5232 patients. In this study we sought to extend our model by performing a detailed statistical analysis of the mapped LS data to characterize the functional anatomy of the superficial lymphatics without any a-priori spatial bias. We investigated the commonly held assumption that lymphatic drainage is symmetric between the two sides of the body. Results indicated that, with the exception of the <b>lower</b> anterior <b>torso,</b> posterior leg and a small section of the posterior torso, most skin regions with sufficient data showed symmetric drainage. LS data from each symmetric skin region were then reflected to the opposite side of the body to provide an increased LS dataset for subsequent analysis. Cluster analysis was then applied to this reflected LS dataset to group regions of skin that drained in a similar manner. Results defined nine large clusters of skin, largely draining to the dominant axillary, groin, cervical level II and preauricular node fields. Each of the four axillary and groin node fields defined large clusters of skin on the torso, dividing it into regions similar to the historical ‘Sappey's lines’, although a fifth region of highly ambiguous drainage was also shown in the anterior and posterior center of the torso. Collectively, these results provide important new insights into skin lymphatic drainage, both improving and quantifying our understanding of functional lymphatic anatomy...|$|R
