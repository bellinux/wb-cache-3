60|$|It {{was a long}} weary pull to the Gull <b>light-ship.</b> When {{they reached}} it they hailed those on board, and asked where away the wreck was.|$|E
60|$|With {{a look of}} calm, sober gravity {{the young}} seaman stood {{grasping}} the weather-shrouds of the mainmast, and looking intently towards the <b>light-ship</b> called the Gull Light, which is anchored off the North-sand-head.|$|E
60|$|Before {{they were}} off the beach the dull report of a cannon-shot was heard. It came from the <b>light-ship,</b> and {{immediately}} after a rocket flew up, indicating by {{the direction in which}} it sloped that another vessel was in distress on the shoals.|$|E
60|$|They {{were now}} in the Knob Channel, and the sea, {{although}} still heavy, was more regular. As they passed the Mouse <b>Light-ship</b> there were several large steamers at anchor there, but it was now a straight run down to the Nore and they held on.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have worried}} through the waters that are [...] called the Doldrums, [...] And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye [...] grope-- Blast my eyes, but the <b>light-ship</b> is hid by the [...] mist, lads:-- [...] Flying Dutchman--odds bobbs--off the [...] Cape of Good Hope! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{expression}} of a face consigned to utter loneliness, when a friend first looks in upon it, {{is moving in the}} extreme. In rowing seaward to a <b>light-ship</b> or sea-girt lighthouse, where, without any immediate terror of death, the inmates experience the gloom of monotonous seclusion, the grateful eloquence of their countenances at the greeting, expressive of thankfulness for the visit, is enough to stir the emotions of the most careless observer.|$|E
60|$|The weather, {{that had}} {{appeared}} threatening during the night, suddenly became calm and fine, {{as if to}} corroborate the statement of the waiter of the Fortress Hotel in regard to its uncertainty; but knowing men in oilcloth sou'westers and long boots gave it as their opinion that the weather {{was not to be}} trusted. Fortunately for the traveller, it remained trustworthy long enough to serve his purpose. The calm permitted his boat to go safely alongside of the <b>light-ship,</b> and to climb up the side without difficulty.|$|E
60|$|She drew a long deep breath, {{which was}} half a sob. Knight's face was hard, {{and he never}} looked at her at all, still fixing his gaze far out to sea, which the sun had now {{resigned}} to the shade. In high places it is not long from sunset to night, dusk being in a measure banished, and though only evening where they sat, it had been twilight in the valleys for half an hour. Upon the dull expanse of sea there gradually intensified itself into existence the gleam of a distant <b>light-ship.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Due {{south of}} Portland Bill. Those are the lights abeam of us: look. A terrible spot, that, on a stormy night. And {{do you see}} a very small light that dips and rises to the right? That's a <b>light-ship</b> on the {{dangerous}} shoal called the Shambles, where many a good vessel has gone to pieces. Between it and ourselves is the Race--a place where antagonistic currents meet and form whirlpools--a spot which is rough in the smoothest weather, and terrific in a wind. That dark, dreary horizon we just discern to the left is the West Bay, terminated landwards by the Chesil Beach.' ...|$|E
60|$|Without an instant's {{hesitation}} {{he brought}} the sloop about and headed her for the <b>light-ship</b> on Brenton's reef, and they sailed in silence. Awhile she watched the sapphire waters break to dazzling whiteness under the westerning sun. Then, in an ecstasy she did not seek to question, {{she closed her eyes}} to feel more keenly the swift motion of their flight. Why not? The sea, the winds of heaven, had aided others since the dawn of history. Legend was eternally true. On these very shores happiness had awaited those who had dared to face primeval things.|$|E
6000|$|The next day, in New York, {{was a hot}} one. Still {{we managed}} to get more or less {{entertainment}} out of it. Toward {{the middle of the}} afternoon we arrived on board the stanch steamship Bermuda, with bag and baggage, and hunted for a shady place. It was blazing summer weather, until we were half-way down the harbor. Then I buttoned my coat closely; half an hour later I put on a spring overcoat and buttoned that. As we passed the <b>light-ship</b> I added an ulster and tied a handkerchief around the collar to hold it snug to my neck. So rapidly had the summer gone and winter come again? ...|$|E
60|$|In rescuing another lad from drowning, Ned Woodthorpe is {{compelled}} to {{take refuge in}} a <b>light-ship,</b> from which he is involuntarily transferred to an outward-bound convict-ship. After a series of exciting events, in which Bowkitt, an innocent convict, plays a brilliant part, the convicts and mutinous crew obtain the mastery {{under the leadership of}} a fanatical gold-seeker. The officers, Ned, and Bowkitt are set adrift in the cutter, and eventually land on a desert island, to which also the mutineers find their way. By the want of discipline of the latter, opportunity is afforded for the daring recapture of the ship, and Ned and his friends escape from the island.|$|E
60|$|At length {{they reached}} the light-ship; hailed her and {{were told that the}} wreck was on a high part of the shingles, bearing north-west from the light. Away they went in that {{direction}}, but, being unable to find her, {{made their way to the}} Prince's <b>light-ship,</b> where they were told there was a large ship on the Girdler. Once more they steamed in the direction indicated, and soon discovered the wreck by the tar-barrels which she was burning. Just as they sighted her an enormous sea broke over the steamer with such violence as to stop her way for a moment, and cause her strong frame to quiver.|$|E
6000|$|The {{crew and}} {{passengers}} of the [...] "Nancy" [...] were still clinging to the cross-trees, benumbed and almost unable to speak or move when the lifeboat approached. With the exception of Bax and Bluenose, they were all so thoroughly exhausted as to have become comparatively indifferent to, and therefore ignorant of, all {{that was going on}} around them. All their energies were required to enable them simply to retain their position on the rigging. At first the sight of the rockets from the <b>light-ship,</b> and her lanterns gleaming in the far distance, had aroused feelings of hope, but as hour after hour passed away the most of the unhappy people fell into a sort of stupor or indifference, and the lights were no longer regarded with hopeful looks.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} {{saturated}} mass caught fire, and instantly a rich flame of light flashed over the wild scene, and clearly revealed {{to them the}} appalling circumstances {{in which they were}} placed. Poor Lucy shuddered, and covering her eyes cast herself in prayer on Him who is [...] "mighty to save." [...] Bax raised the burning mass high over his head, and waved it in the black air. He even clambered {{to the top of the}} broken mast, in order to let it be seen far and wide over the watery waste. The inflammable turpentine refused to be quenched by the raging storm, and in a few seconds they had the comfort of seeing the bright flame of a rocket shoot up into the sky. At the same moment a flash in the distance showed that their signal had been observed by the <b>light-ship.</b>|$|E
60|$|This arrangement, by the way, of {{hoisting}} {{a signal}} {{on board the}} floating lights when any of the Trinity yachts chance to heave in sight, is a clever device, whereby the vigilance of <b>light-ship</b> crews is secured, because {{the time of the}} appearing of these yachts is irregular, and, therefore, a matter of uncertainty. Every one knows the natural and almost irresistible tendency of the human mind to relax in vigilance when the demand on attention is continual--that the act, by becoming a mere matter of daily routine, loses much of its intensity. The crews of floating lights are, more than most men, required to be perpetually on the alert, because, besides the danger that would threaten innumerable ships should their vessels drift from their stations, or any part of their management be neglected, there is great danger to themselves of being run into during dark stormy nights or foggy days. Constant vigilance is partly secured, no doubt, by a sense of duty in the men; it is increased by the feeling of personal risk that would result from carelessness; and it is almost perfected by the order for the hoisting of a flag as above referred to.|$|E
6000|$|On all {{of these}} {{occasions}} the men on duty in the floating lights are bound to hoist their flag whenever the tender chances to pass them within sight, on pain of a severe reprimand if the duty be neglected, and something worse if such neglect be of frequent occurrence. In addition to this, some of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House make periodical visits of inspection to all the floating lights round the coasts of England; and this they do purposely at irregular times, in order, if possible, to catch the guardians of the coast napping; and woe betide [...] "the watch" [...] on duty if these inspecting Brethren should manage to get pretty close to any <b>light-ship</b> without having received the salute of recognition! Hence {{the men of the}} floating lights are kept ever on the alert, and the safety of the navigation, as far as human wisdom can do it, is secured. Hence also, at whatever time any of our floating lights should chance to be visited by strangers, they, like our lighthouses, will invariably be found in perfect working order, and as clean as new pins, except, of course, during periods of general cleaning up or painting.|$|E

6000|$|Quitting Portland, it was {{necessary}} to make rather a round turn on leaving the breakwater, as right ahead on the starboard bow was a small <b>light-ship,</b> looking like the skeleton of a vessel, and marking the presence of a dangerous shoal, known by the most appropriate and significant name of [...] "The Shambles." [...] Inside this lay a long and turbid ridge of angry water, where the Race of Portland ran, and where a deep rolling swell, like the Bay of Biscay on a reduced scale, kept tumbling and breaking into spray like drifts of snow against the high, gaunt cliffs. It, however, required no actual watching of the low green mounds of water, which seemed butting against the coast, to convince all on board that the Great Eastern was at sea. To the infinite relief and comfort of all the passengers, the vessel began to yield to reason, and to behave as much like another ship as she could consistently with her size. It would be too much to say she rolled at this time; for when the Great Eastern rolls, if ever she does roll, travellers may depend upon her accomplishing something in that peculiar style of ocean navigation quite in proportion to her bulk; but one thing is certain-- that she went from side to side sufficiently to show that she was susceptible of the motion of the water, and that if ever she steams across a beam sea, she is likely to move to it with a will, though slowly and easily.|$|E

6000|$|It was an {{interesting}} kingdom in detail. Leaving out of view all that which was behind him, and which, of course, he could not see, we may remark that, just before him stood the binnacle and compass, and the cabin skylight. On his right and left {{the territory of the}} quarter-deck was seriously circumscribed, and the promenade much interfered with, by the ship's boats, which, like their parent, were painted red, and which did not hang at the davits, but, like young lobsters of the kangaroo type, found shelter within their mother, when not at sea on their own account. Near to them were two signal-carronades. Beyond the skylight rose the bright brass funnel of the cabin chimney, and the winch, by means of which the lantern was hoisted. Then came another skylight, and the companion-hatch about the centre of the deck. Just beyond this stood {{the most important part of}} the vessel--the lantern-house. This was a circular wooden structure, above six feet in diameter, with a door and small windows. Inside was the lantern--the beautiful piece of costly mechanism for which the <b>light-ship,</b> its crew, and its appurtenances were maintained. Right through the centre of this house rose the thick unyielding mast of the vessel. The lantern, which was just a little less than its house, surrounded this mast and travelled upon it. Beyond this the capital of the kingdom, the eye of the monarch was arrested by another bright brass funnel, which was the chimney of the galley-fire, and indicated the exact position of the abode of the crew, or--to continue our metaphor--the populace, who, however, required no such indicator to tell of their existence or locality, for the chorus of a [...] "nigger" [...] melody burst from them, ever and anon, through every opening in the decks, with jovial violence, as they sat, busily engaged on various pieces of work below. The more remote parts of this landscape--or light-scape, if we may be allowed the expression--were filled up with the galley-skylight, the bitts, and the windlass, above which towered the gong, and around which twined the two enormous chain cables. Only one of these, however, was in use--that, with a single mushroom-anchor, being sufficient to hold the ship securely against tide and tempest.|$|E

50|$|Poor weather {{conditions}} on November 13 {{contributed to the}} disaster. A gale created lashing rain and a heavy sea. Shortly after 23:00 PM, flares were seen from a vessel on the Barber sands. The Cockle <b>light-ship</b> fired distress signals to indicate a vessel in trouble. The crew of the Lifeboat Beauchamp were alerted and {{an attempt was made}} to launch the Lifeboat. The heavy seas washed the boat off her skids and she was hauled back up the beach for another attempt. The crew fought until 2:00 AM in the dark and cold with warp and tackle to get the Lifeboat afloat.|$|E
50|$|American Marconi's {{growth in}} the United States was {{initially}} limited due to some unusual factors. Its largest potential customer was the U.S. government, {{and in particular the}} U.S. Navy, which rapidly developed plans to equip its vessels with radio transmitters. However, the Navy would have a contentious relationship with the company during most of its existence. An early source of friction was a Marconi station installed on the Nantucket Shoals <b>light-ship</b> by the New York Herald in the summer of 1901. American Marconi's refusal to communicate with non-Marconi stations soon led to an international incident when, in early 1902, the Nantucket operators were unwilling to acknowledge a transmission from the German vessel Deutschland. The German government made a formal protest, and Navy attempted to get American Marconi to eliminate the restrictive policy, but company officials refused, so the Lighthouse Board ordered the Marconi equipment removed, and it was replaced by a station designed by the Navy.|$|E

In early 1964 the {{brothers}} Verweij bought the ship. The 3 brothers formed the management of Radio Veronica. The Norderney was bought to replace the former German lightvessel Borkum Riff from 1911 as that vessel was completely worn-out and also {{a little bit to}} small to continue to be operated as a radio ship. As (former) light-vessel the Borkum Riff had her name printed in large letters on the hull of the ship: this idea was copied on the Norderney, even though she wasn't a <b>light-ship.</b>|$|E
