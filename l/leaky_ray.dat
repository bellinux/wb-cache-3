40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. This work is an investigation of <b>leaky</b> <b>ray</b> (mode) attenuation in graded multimode fibres. In contrast to slab or rectangular dielectric waveguides, cylindrical fibres possess leaky modes which greatly modify their propagation properties. The power carried by such modes eventually diminishes to zero, thus adding no useful contribution to the signal transmission over fibre channels. Suitable filtering techniques are therefore proposed.

A simple sensing principle of the proposed sensor is presented by analyzing the V-number of leaky rays. An experimental is carried out by tapering the plastic multi-mode step-index fiber to measure {{the temperature of the}} cement paste. The numerical result shows that the V-number of <b>leaky</b> <b>ray</b> is increasing with the raised in temperature. The experimental results are in agreement with the results from the theoretical analysis...|$|E
50|$|Leaky modes {{correspond}} to <b>leaky</b> <b>rays</b> in the terminology of geometric optics.The propagation of light through optical fibre {{can take place}} via meridional rays or skew rays. These skew rays suffer only partial reflection while meridional rays are completely guided. Thus the modes allowing propagation of skew <b>rays</b> are called <b>leaky</b> modes. Some optical power is lost into clad due to these modes.|$|R
40|$|Calculations are {{presented}} of the transit times of guided and tunnelling rays in graded-index optical fibres. It is shown that 25 % {{of the power}} launched by an incoherent source into a parabolic-index fibre is carried by <b>leaky</b> <b>rays,</b> which may increase the r. m. s. width of the impulse response by up to 41 %. The profile which most effectively equalises the combined transit times of both guided and tunneling rays is given by alpha = 2 - 4 Delt...|$|R
40|$|Light {{propagation}} is {{analyzed in}} thermally expanded core (TEC) fibers with graded-index profile. Used as power mixers among others, their core structure at {{the boundary between}} the heated and non-heated regions is represented by linear taper. Ray optics is used as the transverse taper dimensions are large relative to the wavelength of propagating light. Trajectories of meridian rays are derived analytically. Numerical results presented show ray trajectories as functions of the position within the taper and taper slope. These are modulated sinusoidal functions whose amplitude and period rise with the taper radius. Both, bound and <b>leaky</b> <b>rays</b> have been examined. </p...|$|R

In an optical fibre of circular cross section, <b>leaky</b> skew <b>rays</b> transmit power {{in a different way}} from trapped and meridional rays. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the evanescent wave absorption coefficient for <b>leaky</b> skew <b>rays</b> in multimode optical fibre evanescent wave absorption sensors is presented. Further, a comprehensive expression for the effective evanescent wave absorption coefficient is obtained. Some numerical results are given to illustrate this theoretical analysis. This work could be applied to optimize the design of fibre-optic evanescent wave absorption sensors...|$|R
40|$|Several {{radioactive}} isotopes {{have been}} proposed as clocks {{for the study of}} the mean cosmic ray confinement time, T sub e. Measurements of Be- 10 and Al- 26 give a value for T sub e of about 10 Myr when one uses a <b>leaky</b> box cosmic <b>ray</b> propagation model. It is important to obtain additional measurements of T sub e from other radioactive isotopes in order to check whether the confinement is the same throughout the periodic table. The possible use of Tc (Z = 43) as a cosmic clock is investigated. Since all isotopes of Tc are radioactive, one might be able to group these isotopes and use the elemental abundance as a whole. The results of the calculations are somewhat inconclusive for two reasons. First, the beta + decay half lives of two of the Tc isotopes relevant to our calculation are not known. Second, the dependence of the Tc abundance on the mean confinement time is rather weak when one considers the number of events expected in 4 trays of plastic track detectors. However, a future, finite measurement of the Beta + half lives and the possible use of the entire collecting area of the HNC to detect Tc nuclei could make the use of Tc as a cosmic ray clock more attractive...|$|R
