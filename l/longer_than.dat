5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). <b>Longer</b> <b>than</b> triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the fore wings. In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> fore wings engage in flight.|$|E

5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> those of the parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
