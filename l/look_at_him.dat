5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't get a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> through his window.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond {{planned to}} go to Winchester Agricultural College, {{following}} the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond's school cricket record and suggesting that they take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played in a trial match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing the local press. Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire's committee visited Hammond's mother {{in an attempt to}} sign him for the club. Hammond's mother was initially reluctant, but his eagerness finally convinced her and he signed a professional contract.|$|E
60|$|Mary <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> reflectively. His sister <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> also.|$|R
60|$|The woman <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadfastly, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{as though}} she had come into contact with some strange creature.|$|R
60|$|The {{silence of}} that minute was horrible to Undy, {{and yet he}} could hardly bring himself to break it. The judge <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes which seemed to read his inmost soul; the jury <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> condemning him one and all; Alaric <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with fierce, glaring eyes of hatred, the same eyes that had glared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that night {{when he had been}} {{collared}} in the street; the whole crowd <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> derisively; but the eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of Mr. Chaffanbrass.|$|R
25|$|The Beast, then {{hearing the}} {{officers}} are near moves away, pulls the chaise back down breaking a lamp. The two {{run away and}} the woman removes the Beast's hood so she can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> clearly. She accepts him and caresses his face while they embrace. As they pull away, the Beast is returned to his human form, and the two disappear just before the police catch them. The woman and the transformed Beast finally ride off into the sunrise on his motorbike.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{fortnight}} later, the band, at first subdued, {{broke out in}} a 'wild strain of brazen minstrelsy' during the final bars of the funeral march in the Eroica Symphony. After the movement was applauded {{a member of the}} audience began calling out that a complaint should be lodged, and won general approval, hear, hear, and people standing up to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> On one occasion Lady Henschel and her daughter went to hear Joseph Joachim play at a Saturday 'Pop', but were so aware of the 'rhythmic gay sounds, thumping and shimmering away in a most enlivening manner', that they decided to go and hear Moore and Burgess instead.|$|E
25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry {{back from the brink}} of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quizzically for a moment, {{as she had}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> often {{since he}} had gone to work for Feinheimer.|$|R
60|$|Kit {{acknowledged}} these {{expressions of}} confidence by touching his hat again and blushing very much. The old gentleman then handed {{the old lady}} out, and after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an approving smile, {{they went into the}} house--talking about him as they went, Kit could not help feeling. Presently Mr Witherden, smelling very hard at the nosegay, came to the window and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and after that Mr Abel came and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and after that the old gentleman and lady came and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, and after that they all came and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> together, which Kit, feeling very much embarrassed by, made a pretence of not observing. Therefore he patted the pony more and more; and this liberty the pony most handsomely permitted.|$|R
60|$|With {{her elbows}} on her bench, and her chin upon her hands, Miss Jenny Wren sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a watchful sidelong look. Lizzie, in her {{different}} way, sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> too.|$|R
25|$|As for the black--whose brain, not body, had schemed {{and led the}} revolt, {{with the}} plot--his slight frame, {{inadequate}} tothat which it held, had at once yielded to the superior muscular strength of his captor, in the boat. Seeing all was over, he uttered no sound, {{and could not be}} forced to. His aspect seemed to say, since I cannot do deeds, I will not speak words. Put in irons in the hold, he was carried to Lima. During the passage, Don Benito did not visit him. Nor then, nor at any time after, would he <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Before the tribunal he refused. When pressed by the judges, he fainted. On the testimony of the sailors alone rested the legal identity of Babo.|$|E
25|$|Rico's crimes {{started with}} {{allowing}} gangs {{to operate as}} long as they stayed 'quiet'. This soon escalated to allowing guilty perps to remain free, unjudicial relations and drinking, taking bribes from organised crime, running blackmail operations, protection rackets, killing perps that had surrendered (and faking the charges) and brutalising innocent people to get 'confessions'. As he had a high clearance rate, Justice Department didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> too closely. Joe's efforts to persuade Rico to change his ways fell on deaf ears and much to Joe's distate, he found himself turning to Rico on occasion for information on underworld figures. When Judge Kenner, Rico's former Assessing Judge, became suspicious, Rico secretly murdered him and dumped the body in a rad pit. He started to live in an Oldtown apartment, flaunting his money and corruption.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted {{out of the}} Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost {{stripped}} of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned {{as long as he}} is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does everything they can to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the Daily Prophet. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's hearing with a witness (Arabella Figg) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed {{to the point of being}} angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She halted, {{and seemed}} {{for a second}} to hesitate, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> oddly. Then {{she came back to}} the table and took up her roses. Again she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and let the bouquet fall back among the papers.|$|R
6000|$|The Hermit <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> irresolutely, {{and retired}} to his soot and cinders and lay down, {{and got up}} again {{and came to the}} bars, and again <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> irresolutely, and finally said with sharpness: [...] "I don't like tobacco." ...|$|R
60|$|His mother <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He had {{forgotten}} Miriam now. He {{told her about}} the girls in the Willow Tree. Mrs. Morel <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> It seemed unreal, his gaiety. At the back of it was too much horror and misery.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a second <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
60|$|Very remarkably, Riderhood put no {{question}} to <b>him.</b> He had <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> on opening the door, {{and he now}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again (stealthily this time), {{and the result of}} his looking was, that he asked him {{no question}}.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Buffin did {{not affect}} to misunderstand. Sid Marks was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. Otto the Sausage was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. Rabbit Butler was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. This was an {{occasion}} where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at. To be misunderstood in the circles in which Mr. Buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure.|$|R
60|$|Miss Pinnegar <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and did not}} speak. In {{that moment}} all the anger which was due to him from all womanhood was silently {{discharged}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> like a black bolt of silent electricity. But Miss Pinnegar, the engine of wrath, felt she would burst.|$|R
25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{upbringing}} in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and {{his penchant}} for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image. [...] "I think people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and think John Wayne", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Dan Ford, from Wareham in Dorset, {{received}} permanent scarring to {{his face}} after being sprayed with CS during an arrest by police. Ford was subsequently advised by doctors {{to stay out of}} sunlight for at least 12 months. After the incident, his cousin, Donna Lewis, was quoted as saying, [...] "To <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> it was like looking at a melting man, with liquid oozing from his face." ...|$|E
60|$|Courthon <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as {{he might}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> an impertinent lackey.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Benjamin <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{his father}}, {{and his father}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|All <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in wonder, save Nibs, who {{fortunately}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Wendy.|$|R
500|$|Fifth-year senior Turner {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} uncontested starter at quarterback {{for the first time}} in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's {{seniority}} was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "If I had to choose between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback." [...] Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. Turner said, [...] "Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year." [...] Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, [...] "You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he was kind of mushy last year. You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|The Warriors saw Lin as a {{potential}} backup for Curry. Lacob said the team received more than one trade offer for Lin {{while he was in}} the D-League, but he was happy with Lin's progress as an undrafted free agent. [...] "He's a minimum, inexpensive asset. You need to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as a developing asset. Is he going to be a superstar? No." [...] He finished his rookie NBA season averaging 2.6points on 38.9percent shooting in 29games.|$|E
500|$|From this time, Edward {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, Nellie Clifden, who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers. Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at Cambridge to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes {{for the rest of her}} life and blamed Edward for his father's death. At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, [...] "I never can, or shall, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> without a shudder." ...|$|E
60|$|Pasa <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as {{a mother}} <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a beloved but capricious babe.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{as a great}} lady would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a presuming servant.|$|R
