5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "failed or betrayed friendship", in Leng's words, is most evident {{midway through the}} third verse, with the lines [...] "You've got me {{wondering}} how I <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> friendship / But I see it in your eyes". Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E

500|$|Departures was {{submitted}} to the 81st Academy Awards as Japan's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film award. Although eleven previous Japanese films had won Academy Awards in other categories, such as Best Animated Feature or Best Costume Design, the as-yet unattained Best Foreign Language Film award was highly coveted in the Japanese film industry. Departures was not expected to win, owing to strong competition from the Israeli and French submissions (Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir and Laurent Cantet's The Class, respectively), but was ultimately the victor at the February 2009 ceremony. This was considered a surprise by several film critics, and The New York Times David Itzkoff termed Departures [...] "The Film That <b>Lost</b> <b>Your</b> Oscars Pool for You". Motoki, who was expecting the [...] "wonderful" [...] Israeli submission to win, was also surprised; he {{described himself as a}} [...] "hanger-on who just observes the ceremony", and regretted [...] "not walk with more confidence" [...] upon his arrival.|$|E
500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Salk {{preferred}} not to have {{his career as a}} scientist affected by too much personal attention, as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life, but this proved to be impossible. [...] "Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you—you've <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> anonymity", the television personality Ed Murrow said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention. When Murrow asked him, [...] "Who owns this patent?", Salk replied, [...] "Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" [...] The vaccine is calculated to be worth $7 billion had it been patented. However, lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis did look into the possibility of a patent, but ultimately determined that the vaccine was not a patentable invention because of prior art.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Neal's comedy {{has been}} {{described}} as conversational. He was a provocateur, often inciting audience members to call out, or even leave the club. [...] "I've seen him give people money to leave," [...] recalls Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes. At times he would encourage people to call out to the stage in order to set up a punchline. [...] "Ladies, how would you keep your man if you <b>lost</b> <b>your</b> vagina?," [...] O'Neal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, [...] "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes." [...] Additionally, speaking on sex he on several occasions discussed his personal kinks; for instance an appreciation for urolagnia, even stating that his girlfriend noticing that his urine tasted like [...] "birthday cake" [...] is how he came to find out that he suffered from diabetes.|$|E

Hill would return home with the pastries in the evenings after being called away by a message on his pager. On Friday, March 14, the Hills attended Houston's annual wild game dinner, where John played a concert with the Heartbeats. They left early, {{and on the way}} home Joan asked her husband if he would be staying out all night again. When he said that he probably would, she reminded him that he had done this on two previous occasions that week. The conversation quickly descended into an argument in which she told him that if he did stay out, he should not bother to come back. When they arrived home, {{she got out of the}} car, and he began to drive away, at which point she became angry and shouted [...] "You've blown it, John!
