40|$|This is a MSc {{research}} project, and {{is aimed}} at the new insight on the stratigraphy, sedimentary facies, diagenesis and depositional environments of the Ecca Group, Karoo Supergroup in the Eastern Cape Province. Methodologies used in this research include field investigation, stratigraphic logging, thin-section microscope study, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses. The stratigraphy of the Ecca Group is divided into five formations, namely the Prince Albert Formation, Whitehill Formation, Collingham Formation, Rippon Formation and the Fort Brown Formation from bottom upward. Based on the field investigation and laboratory correlation, the Prince Albert, Whitehill, Collingham, and Fort Brown Formations can each be subdivided into two new members, i. e. lower member and upper member; whereas three new members have been proposed for the Rippon Formation, i. e. lower, middle and upper members. The Ecca Group sediments were accumulated in various depositional environments, from bottom of deep marine environment, passed {{through the middle of}} deltaic environment, and ended in a lacustrine environment. The Prince Albert Formation, Whitehill Formation and the Collingham Formation were all deposited in a deep marine basin, whilst the Rippon Formation was laid down in a deltaic environment. As the climate gradually became warmer and drier, the top Fort Brown Formation was lastly deposited in a lacustrine environment. The stratigraphic succession of the Ecca Group constitutes a perfect regression sequence, indicating that the marine water gradually retreated and the sea-level gradually dropped. The rocks in the Ecca Group are mainly terrigenous sandstone and mudstone with some coarse grain-sized siliciclastic rock of conglomerate. The sandstones are dominated by feldspathic graywackes with minor quartz-wackes, and there are no arenites in the Ecca Group. Whereas the mudstones are dominated by grayish mudrocks and black shales, purer claystone was found in the turbidite facies of the Collingham Formation, which probably has economic significance for the future since the reserve is quite large. Optical microscope, XRD and SEM analyses demonstrated that the minerals in the Ecca Group include detrital minerals of quartz, orthoclase, microcline, plagioclase, biotite, muscovite; and clay minerals (smectite, kaolinite, illite and sericite). These minerals constitute the rock framework grains and cements whereas; the authigenic minerals of calcite and hematite were formed during diagenesis. Accessory minerals such as rutile and zircon are the heavy minerals present in the strata, and occur only in a small amount. Based on the lithologies, sedimentary structures and sequence stacking patterns, ten sedimentary facies have been recognised, namely 1) Grayish laminated and thin bedded shale facies, 2) Grayish laminated shale and intercalated chert facies, 3) Grayish rhythmite facies (all the three facies above were deposited in deep marine water); 4) Flat and lenticular bedded graywacke facies, 5) Grayish alternating mudstone and sandstone facies, 6) Dark organic rich mudstone facies, 7) Fossil bearing mudstone facies, 8) Laminated and thin bedded black mudstone with lenticular siltstone facies, 9) Interbedded grayish sandstone and mudstone facies (above Facies 4 - 9 were deposited in deltaic environment and appeared in the Rippon Formation); and 10) Varved rhythmic mudstone facies, which occurs only in the Fort Brown Formation and represents lacustrine sediments. Four types of cements have been identified in the rocks of the Ecca Group, including quartz, smectite, calcite and feldspar cements. The first three cement types are the major cement types, whilst the feldspar cement is minor and occurs only locally. Recrystallisation in Ecca sediments includes quartz, feldspar, clay mineral recrystallisation and conversion from smectite and kaolinite to illite and then to sericite. Replacement involves calcite replacing quartz, feldspar and clay matrix; accompanied by albitization, i. e. albite replacing other feldspar minerals in a deep burial environment. Dissolution in the Ecca Group involved calcite and kaolinite dissolving and leaching, which created more pore-space and increased porosity. The sediments of the Ecca Group went through three stages of digenesis, namely the early stage, the late stage and the up <b>lift</b> <b>stage</b> which led the rocks being exposed on the Earth’s surface and being weathered. In each stage, some minerals became unstable, then replaced by a more stable mineral suitable for the new diagenetic environment. Precipitation of cements and formation of authigenic minerals mostly occurred in the early diagenetic stage, which led the soft sediments becoming a hard rock; whilst recrystallisation, replacement, and dissolution took place mostly in the later diagenet...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{differential}} confocal microscopy (DCM) has {{advantages of}} high axial resolution and strong ability of focus identification. However, the imaging mechanism of point scanning needs long measurement time, {{in the process}} due to itself mechanical instability {{and the influence of}} environment vibration the axial drift of object position is inevitable, which will reduce lateral resolution of the DCM. To ensure the lateral resolution we propose an axial drift compensation method based on zero-tracking in this paper. The method takes advantage of the linear region of differential confocal axial response curve, gets axial drift by detecting the laser intensity; uses grating sensor to monitor the real-time axial drift of <b>lifting</b> <b>stage</b> and realizes closed-loop control; uses capacitive sensor of objective driver to measure its position. After getting the axial drift of object, the <b>lifting</b> <b>stage</b> and objective driver will be driven to compensate position according to the axial drift. This method is realized by using Visual Studio 2010, and the experiment demonstrates that the compensation precision of the proposed method can reach 6 nm. It is not only easy to implement, but also can compensate the axial drift actively and real-timely. Above all, this method improves the system stability of DCM effectively...|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of lifting implementations for image wavelet decomposition generated possibilities of several applications and several adaptive decomposition variations. The prediction step of a <b>lifting</b> <b>stage</b> constitutes the interesting {{part of the}} decomposition since it aims to reduce the energy {{of one of the}} decomposition bands by making predictions using the other decomposition band. In that aspect, more successful predictions yield better efficiency in terms of reduced energy in the lower band. In this work, we present a prediction filter whose prediction domain pixels are selected adaptively according to the local edge characteristics of the image. By judicuously selecting the prediction domain from pixels that are expected to have closer relation to the estimated pixel, the prediction error signal energy is reduced. In order to keep the adaptation rule symmetric for the encoder and the decoder sides, lossless compression applications are examined. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides good compression results. Furthermore, the edge calculation is computationally inexpensive and comparable to the famous Daubechies 5 / 3 lifting implementation.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for constructing adaptive wavelet decompositions using the lifting scheme. A major requirement is that perfect reconstruction is possible without any overhead cost. In this paper we restrict ourselves to the update <b>lifting</b> <b>stage.</b> It is assumed that the update filter utilises local gradient information to adapt itself to the signal {{in the sense that}} smaller gradients `evoke' stronger update filters. As a result, sharp transitions in a signal will not be smoothed to the same extent as regions which are more homogeneous. The approach taken in this paper differs from other adaptive schemes found in the literature in the sense that that no bookkeeping is required in order to have perfect reconstruction. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 42 C 40, 94 A 12 Keywords and Phrases: Signal processing, perfect reconstruction filter bank, wavelet, lifting scheme, update lifting, adaptive filter, gradient-based decision, threshold criterion.

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} the directionally spatial prediction (DSP) into the conventional lifting-based wavelet transforms and proposes a novel, efficient and flexible lifting structure (referred as DSP-lifting hereafter). Each <b>lifting</b> <b>stage</b> {{can be performed}} at the direction, where pixels have a strong correlation, rather than always at the horizontal or vertical direction. The proposed DSP enables the predicting and updating process at the fractional pixel without any constraint on the interpolation, which fully exploit the spatial correlation among pixels. Furthermore in the 2 D transform, {{the direction of the}} first 1 D transform is no longer requested to be vertical to that of the second so that the second 1 D transform can utilize the spatial correlation better. The proposed DSP-lifting guarantees the perfect reconstruction. We also investigate the techniques to efficiently estimate and code the directional data, thus increasing the precision of spatial prediction and reducing the overhead bits. Experimental results have shown that the proposed DSP-lifting scheme can significantly outperform JPEG 2000 in terms of PSNR (up to 2 dB) and visual quality. 1...|$|R
