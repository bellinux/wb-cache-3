5000|$|Anton Dreher senior (1810-1863), brewer, {{inventor}} of Schwechater <b>Lagerbier</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In 1840, he {{introduced}} a beer that combined the crispness of lager with the paler hues of the English ale; this new style of beer {{became known as}} the Viennese style and was called Schwechater <b>Lagerbier.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Until the 19th century, the German word <b>Lagerbier</b> (de) {{referred}} to {{all types of}} [...] "bottom-fermented", cool-conditioned beer, in normal strengths. In Germany today however, the term is mainly reserved for the prevalent lager beer styles of southern Germany, [...] "Helles" [...] (pale), or a [...] "Dunkel" [...] (dark). Pilsner, a more heavily hopped pale lager, is most often known as [...] "Pilsner", [...] "Pilsener", or [...] "Pils." [...] Other lagers are Bock, Märzen, and Schwarzbier.|$|E
50|$|Although one of {{the most}} {{defining}} features of lager is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of a specific yeast. While it is possible to use lager yeast in a warm fermentation process, such as with American steam beer, the lack of a cold storage maturation phase precludes such beer from being classified as lager. On the other hand, German Altbier and Kölsch, brewed with a top-fermenting yeast at a warm temperature, but with a cold storage finishing stage, are classified as obergäriges <b>Lagerbier</b> (top-fermented lager beer).|$|E
5000|$|Dortmund {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} commercial brewing centres in Germany, establishing itself as a major brewing city which exported its beers to the neighbouring Westphalian cities. The Dortmunder breweries originally brewed a wheat based, dark coloured, short fermented beer. However, in 1873, when the golden coloured, pale barley based, slow fermented beer as brewed in Pilsen and known as Pilsener, became popular, several of the local breweries grouped together under the name Dortmunder Union to produce their own pale lager under the guidance of the brewmaster Fritz Brinkhoff. There were originally two varieties: <b>Lagerbier</b> and the slightly stronger Export at around 5.5% abv.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1836, Anton Dreher {{took over}} the brewery and {{developed}} the bottom-fermented beer — Schwechater <b>Lagerbier</b> — which he presented in 1840/1841. It was a new style of beer, methodically bottom fermented to produce a brew that was coppery reddish-brown in color. It required steady, cool temperature for maturation and storage, and this requirement gives the beer its name: lager (in German, Lager means storehouse or warehouse). Originally, he called the beer Märtzen, or March beer, because it was brewed in March, when the water was cold, and ice was still available. Eventually the name lager became the accepted name; it was also called Vienna Typ, or Vienna Style beer. In 1858, Dreher's lager {{won the gold medal}} for excellence at the Beer Exhibit in Vienna. The greater honor occurred on 26 November 1861 when Emperor Franz Joseph I visited the brewery and awarded Dreher with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Joseph Order. In 1862, he received the Gold medal with Diploma from the World Exhibition in Paris. In 1869, his Lager beer won the High First Prize.|$|E
