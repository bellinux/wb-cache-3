50|$|Before the {{molecules}} react with the reagents, {{they should be}} prepared for the reactions. The most typical is separation by centrifugal force. In the case of blood, for example, the sedimentation of blood cells from plasma can be achieved by rotating the biodisk for some time. After separation, all molecular diagnostic assays require a step of cell/viral lysis in order to release genomic and proteomic material for downstream processing. Typical lysis methods include chemical and physical method. The chemical <b>lysis</b> <b>method,</b> which is the simplest way, uses chemical detergents or enzymes to break down membranes. The physical lysis can be achieved by using bead beating system on a disk. Lysis occurs due to collisions and shearing between the beads and the cells and through friction shearing along the lysis chamber walls.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of two different methodological approaches for recovering DNA from soil and sediment bacterial communities: cell extraction followed by lysis and DNA recovery (cell extraction method) versus direct cell lysis and alkaline extraction to recover DNA (direct <b>lysis</b> <b>method).</b> Efficiency of DNA recovery by each method was determined by spectrophotometric absorbance and using a tritiated thymidine tracer. With both procedures, the use of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone was important for the removal of humic compounds to improve the purity of the recovered DNA; without extensive purification, various restriction enzymes failed to cut added target DNA. Milligram quantities of high-purity DNA were recovered from 100 -g samples of both soils and sediments by the direct <b>lysis</b> <b>method,</b> which was a greater than 1 -order-of-magnitude-higher yield than by the cell extraction method.

The concentrations of DNA obtained from both methicillin – resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus by rapid <b>lysis</b> <b>method</b> were 74 and 98 µg/ml, while DNA obtained by bashing beads method were 35 and 31 µg/ml in that order from the same strains.

Hence, blood cultures have become critically important and frequently performed test in clinical microbiology laboratories for diagnosis of sepsis.

Materials and Methods: Two hundred nonduplicate blood cultures from cases of sepsis were analyzed using two blood culture methods concurrently for recovery of bacteria from patients diagnosed clinically with sepsis - the conventional blood culture method using trypticase soy broth and the <b>lysis</b> centrifugation <b>method</b> using saponin by centrifuging at 3000 g for 30 minutes. Results: Overall bacteria recovered from 200 blood cultures were 17. 5 %. The conventional blood culture method had a higher yield of organisms, especially Gram positive cocci. The <b>lysis</b> centrifugation <b>method</b> was comparable with the former method with respect to Gram negative bacilli. The sensitivity of <b>lysis</b> centrifugation <b>method</b> in comparison to conventional blood culture method was 49. 75 % in this study, specificity was 98. 21 % and diagnostic accuracy was 89. 5 %. In almost every instance, the time required for detection of the growth was earlier by <b>lysis</b> centrifugation <b>method,</b> which was statistically significant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a protocol to analyze blood samples in yellow fever 17 DD vaccinated which developed serious adverse events. We investigated whether or not the time between sample collection and sample processing could interfere in lymphocyte subset percentage, for it is often impossible to analyze blood samples immediately after collection due to transport delay from collection places to the flow cytometry facility. CD 4 +CD 38 + T, CD 8 +CD 38 + T, CD 3 + T, CD 19 + B lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry in nine healthy volunteers immediately after blood collection and after intervals of 24 and 48 h. The whole blood <b>lysis</b> <b>method</b> and gradient sedimentation by Histopaque were applied to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells for flow cytometry analyses. With the <b>lysis</b> <b>method,</b> there was no significant change in lymphocyte subset percentage between the two time intervals (24 and 48 h). In contrast, when blood samples were processed by Histopaque gradient sedimentation, time intervals for sample processing influenced the percentage in T lymphocyte subsets but not in B cells. From the results obtained, we could conclude that the whole blood <b>lysis</b> <b>method</b> is more appropriate than gradient sedimentation by Histopaque for immunophenotyping of blood samples collected after serious adverse events, due to less variation in the lymphocyte subset levels with respect to the time factor...|$|E
