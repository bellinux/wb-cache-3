30|$|Health tourism {{has become}} one of the fastest growing subfields in the tourist sector in recent years. It has {{enhanced}} foreign exchange earnings, which has elevated economic opportunities in the destinations. Thus, an increasing number of countries have been competing for a greater market share and to encourage inbound tourism by presenting attractive opportunities in their medical services. These destinations have increased their investment in advanced technology and attractive accommodation (Horowitz et al. 2007). Furthermore, health care is predominantly a service industry and it has been affected by the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trade</b> process that is related to the sector. Accordingly, the regulations <b>of</b> the World <b>Trade</b> Organization and its General Agreement on Trade in Services concerning the free movement of goods and services has accelerated the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trade</b> in health services (Lunt et al. 2011).|$|R

25|$|Instead, {{the greater}} <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> {{from a large}} {{merchant}} base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated {{from the rest of}} mainland Europe.|$|E

For example, in an invited address to the Indian parliament in December 2010, Jagdish Bhagwati, Professor of Economics and Law at the Columbia University analysed the relationship between growth and poverty reduction, then urged the Indian parliament to extend economic reforms by freeing up of the retail sector, further <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in all sectors, and introducing labour market reforms.

40|$|Abstract <b>Liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trading</b> environment, through {{regional}} integration {{and the formation}} of WTO, is shown to increase trade growth relative to GDP. The impact <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisation</b> compounded over time and added about 1. 5 per cent per annum to world trade growth during the last decade. Trade, demand and competitiveness without trade liberalisation variables do not cointegrate in the long run and on their own cannot provide a coherent structural explanation of the growth <b>of</b> world <b>trade.</b> Results obtained from standard panel techniques, augmented with CCE estimator, point to strong commonalities across countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Underdevelopment of {{developing}} countries is in present one of the thorniest problems of the world. Economic globalisation brings about increasingly deeper integration of world markets and increasing volumes <b>of</b> international <b>trade.</b> Multilateral trading system represented by the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is one of the}} instruments that can, under certain circumstances, strongly contribute to economic progress {{of developing}} countries. The goal of the thesis is to reveal such circumstances and describe their coherence with the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Firstly, the thesis focuses on theoretical basis <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> as an instrument of economic development. The thesis also describes possible imperfections of the theory specifically with regard to developing countries. Secondly, the role of the WTO in the process <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> and its activities leading to reduction or elimination of the imperfections are described.
