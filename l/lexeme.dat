The morphological structure and semantics of compound <b>lexemes</b> are considered, as well as strategies for translating English metaphorical compound <b>lexemes</b> into Serbian. The analysis reveals that Serbian cannot cope with the dynamic nature of traffic engineering terminology in English, and that Anglicisms, synonyms of different polysemous terms and vague conceptual determinations are characteristic of Serbian terminological equivalent...|$|R
50|$|Items in the lexicon {{are called}} <b>lexemes,</b> or lexical items, or word forms. <b>Lexemes</b> are not atomic {{elements}} but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe {{the size of}} a lexicon, <b>lexemes</b> are grouped into lemmas. A lemma is a group of <b>lexemes</b> generated by inflectional morphology. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the citation forms and any irregular forms, since these must be learned to use the words correctly. <b>Lexemes</b> derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. Closed categories, such as determiners or pronouns, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily syntactic. Open categories, such as nouns and verbs, have highly active generation mechanisms and their <b>lexemes</b> are more semantic in nature.|$|R

The <b>lexeme</b> Comcaac is used in the Seri language only to refer to the people.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{several of}} the {{developers}} of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated {{in an effort to}} improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, <b>lexeme</b> and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, <b>lexeme</b> or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a <b>lexeme</b> or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} components in the process of building automatic speech recognition (ASR) capabilities for a new language is the lexicon, or pronouncing dictionary. For practical reasons, it is desirable to manually create only the minimal lexicon using available native-speaker phonetic expertise and, then, use the resulting seed lexicon for machine learning based induction of a highquality letter-to-sound (L 2 S) model for generation of pronunciations for the remaining words of the language. This paper examines the viability of this scenario, specifically investigating three possible strategies for selection of <b>lexemes</b> (words) for manual transcription – choosing the most frequent <b>lexemes</b> of the language, choosing <b>lexemes</b> randomly, and selection of <b>lexemes</b> via an information theoretic diversity measure. The relative effectiveness of these three strategies is evaluated {{as a function of the}} number of <b>lexemes</b> to be transcribed to create a bootstrapping lexicon. Generally, the newly developed orthographic diversity based selection strategy outperforms the others for this scenario where a limited number of <b>lexemes</b> can be transcribed. The experiments also provide generally useful insight into expected L 2 S accuracy sacrifice as a function of decreasing training set size. 1...|$|R
25|$|Word {{stress in}} Araki {{normally}} {{falls on the}} penultimate syllable, at least when the last syllable of the word is of the form -(C)V. A secondary stress may be heard on every second syllable toward {{the left of the}} word. Stress is assigned only after the <b>lexeme</b> has received all its affixes to form the whole phonological word. A process of final high vowel deletion (which is common in Vanuatu languages) does not affect the stress rule.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: {{formerly}} also simply called Construction Grammar {{in upper}} case) {{focuses on the}} formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike head-driven phrase structure grammar. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Laura Michaelis, and {{to a certain extent}} Ivan Sag. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995 and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001 is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or <b>lexeme</b> classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal <b>lexeme</b> entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.|$|E

This meaning also coincides with the biblical Kīmāh and the Arabic word for the Pleiades — Al Thurayya.

500|$|Thus, {{languages}} {{must have}} a vocabulary of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign [...] "dog" [...] denotes, for example, {{a member of the}} species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a <b>lexeme.</b> Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of grammatical categories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{gives an}} {{exposition}} of some adapted English <b>lexemes</b> into Dholuo. The work {{relied on a}} descriptive design. Total purposive sampling technique was incorporated in collecting secondary data to saturation level. All the adapted nominal <b>lexemes</b> from the English Dholuo Dictionary (EDD) were collected, qualitatively analyzed, edited and presented thematically by showing the adapted <b>lexemes</b> in various areas. The results indicate that adapted <b>lexemes</b> in this lexicographical work are manifested in the following areas: religion, people, subjects, places, measurements, clothing, vegetables, foodstuff, equipment, vehicles and months. We have gathered that as we adapt some <b>lexemes</b> from English into Dholuo, then phonemes such as /ʃ (sh), z / automatically change to /s/, /v / changes to /f / and /q / changes to /k/. We have concluded that English consonant phonemes such as / ʃ (sh), z, v, q / are not manifested in Dholuo.

2500|$|Ultimate Indo-European {{origin of}} the word {{is the subject of}} {{continued}} debate.
