5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of <b>lipids</b> called triglycerides. <b>Lipids</b> also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize <b>lipids,</b> some essential <b>lipids</b> cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether <b>lipids,</b> whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester <b>lipids.</b> The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the <b>lipids</b> to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester <b>lipids</b> this is an ester bond, whereas in ether <b>lipids</b> this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether <b>lipids,</b> but in contrast to archaea these <b>lipids</b> are not a major part of their membranes.|$|E

40|$|Development {{of early}} stage of larvae depends on body energy content.

Therefore, <b>lipid</b> class for energy decreases and <b>lipid</b> class for maintaining membrane increases. <b>Lipid</b> quality in larvae depends {{on the content of}} essential fatty acid. <b>Lipid</b> from larval stage of neurula; 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 17, and 20 days after hatching were observed on non polar, polar <b>lipid,</b> and essential fatty acid.

5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other <b>lipids,</b> such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer <b>lipids</b> in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of <b>lipids</b> between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lipids</b> are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. <b>Lipids</b> are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of <b>lipids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most <b>lipids</b> are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of <b>lipids</b> from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which <b>lipids</b> are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E

40|$|Chlorella vulgaris accumulates <b>lipid</b> under {{nitrogen}} limitation, but at {{the expense}} of biomass productivity. Due to this tradeoff, improved <b>lipid</b> productivity may be compromised, despite higher <b>lipid</b> content. To determine the optimal degree of nitrogen limitation for <b>lipid</b> productivity, batch cultures of C. vulgaris were grown at different nitrate concentrations. The growth rate, <b>lipid</b> content, <b>lipid</b> productivity and biochemical and elemental composition of the cultures were monitored for 20 days. A starting nitrate concentration of 170 mg L− 1 provided the optimal tradeoff between biomass and <b>lipid</b> production under the experimental conditions. Volumetric <b>lipid</b> yield (in milligram <b>lipid</b> per liter algal culture) was more than double that under nitrogen-replete conditions. Interpolation of the data indicated that the highest volumetric <b>lipid</b> concentration and <b>lipid</b> productivity would occur at nitrate concentrations of 305 and 241 mg L− 1, respectively. There was a strong correlation between the nitrogen content of the cells and the pigment, protein and <b>lipid</b> content, as well as biomass and <b>lipid</b> productivity. Knowledge of the relationships between cell nitrogen content, growth, and cell composition assists in the prediction of the nitrogen regime required for optimal productivity in batch or continuous culture. In addition to enhancing <b>lipid</b> productivity, nitrogen limitation improves the <b>lipid</b> profile for biodiesel production and reduces the requirement for nitrogen fertilizers, resulting in cost and energy savings and a reduction in the environmental burden of the process...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Placental explants obtained from control and neonatal-streptozotocin-induced- diabetic rats on day 13. 5 of gestation were cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of ligands of the three PPARs isoforms (clofibrate, 15 -deoxyδ 12, 14 prostaglandin J 2 and carbaprostacyclin; which are PPARα, PPARγ and PPARδ agonists respectively) for further analysis of <b>lipid</b> metabolism. <b>Lipid</b> levels (triglycerides, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and phospholipids) were analysed by thin layer chromatography, de novo <b>lipid</b> synthesis was assessed by incorporation of 14 C-acetate as a tracer, and <b>lipid</b> catabolism was studied through the evaluation of glycerol release. Results: Placental tissues from diabetic rats showed increased triglycerides and cholesteryl ester levels, decreased de novo <b>lipid</b> synthesis and enhanced <b>lipid</b> catabolism when compared to controls.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and characterise <b>lipid</b> deposition on soft (hydrogel) contact lenses, particularly those containing siloxane components. Studies involving a variety of in vitro doping and in vivo worn contact lenses were undertaken, in which <b>lipid</b> deposition was analyzed by either TLC or HPLC. Specific experiments were completed to optimize a method to extract the <b>lipid</b> from the lens materials, to compare the total <b>lipid</b> deposition on nine different hydrogel lenses and to analyze the effect that <b>lipid</b> deposition had on wettability. A method for extracting <b>lipid</b> from contact lenses using 2 : 1 chloroform: methanol was developed. This study also showed that siloxane-containing contact lens materials differ in the degree to which they deposit <b>lipid,</b> which is dependent upon their chemical composition. Small differences in <b>lipid</b> deposition that occur due to using variations in cleaning regimens were not identifiable through TLC, and required more sophisticated analysis using HPLC. Contact lens material wettability was found to be influenced by in vitro <b>lipid</b> deposition. Specifically, conventional hydrogels and plasma surface-treated silicone-hydrogel materials experienced enhanced wettability with <b>lipid</b> deposition. Reverse-phase HPLC techniques were able to quantify <b>lipid</b> deposits with increased sensitivity and accuracy. From the HPLC studies it was found that contact lens material, concentration of the <b>lipid</b> doping solution, and the composition of the <b>lipid</b> doping solution in in vitro deposition studies influenced the ultimate amount and composition of <b>lipid</b> deposits. In vivo HPLC studies showed that the final <b>lipid</b> deposition pattern was influenced by the interaction between the composition of the tear film and the various silicone hydrogel contact lens materials. In conclusion, HPLC analysis methods were more sensitive and quantitative than TLC. <b>Lipid</b> deposition was ultimately influenced by the concentration and composition of the <b>lipid</b> in the tear film and the contact lens material. Contact lens wettability was influenced by the presence and deposition of <b>lipid</b> onto the contact lens surfaces.
