5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} <b>light,</b> from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of <b>light</b> in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of <b>light</b> is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than <b>light</b> in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint <b>light</b> called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} of <b>light</b> and emits <b>light</b> that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming <b>light.</b> The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which {{coincides with the}} vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal <b>light</b> by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent <b>light.</b> In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit <b>light</b> of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by <b>light</b> from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. <b>Light</b> of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue <b>light</b> is scattered more, leaving <b>light</b> that is perceived as green.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to <b>light)</b> {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a <b>light</b> source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a <b>light</b> source is switched on. The colour of the <b>light</b> does not matter, but {{it has been shown that}} they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce <b>light.</b> Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green <b>light</b> spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared <b>light,</b> and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit <b>light</b> down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared <b>light</b> (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet <b>light.</b> Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1941 {{officials}} at the War Office and in the Army had finally decided that <b>light</b> tanks as a concept were a liability, and too vulnerable {{to be used by}} the British Army. This was due to the poor performance of British <b>light</b> tanks during the Battle of France, caused when a shortage of tanks designed to engage enemy tanks had led to <b>light</b> tanks being deployed against German armour; the resulting high casualties led to the War Office rethinking the suitability of the <b>light</b> tank design. The pre-war role of the <b>light</b> tank, that of reconnaissance, had also been found to be better carried out by scout cars which had smaller crews and better cross-country abilities. Consequently, by the time that significant numbers of the Mk VIII were being produced by Metro-Cammell, they had already become obsolete and did not see combat. There was a requirement for a limited number of <b>light</b> tanks within the organization of British armoured divisions, but this had already been met by the American-produced M5 Stuart <b>light</b> tank. A policy report issued in December 1942 suggested that the tank could be issued to reconnaissance regiments or special <b>light</b> tank regiments raised for specialized operations. These suggestions were discussed and discarded, and instead it was decided that those tanks built should be handed over to the Royal Air Force for use in defending airfields and airbases.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} <b>light</b> only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the <b>light</b> of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected <b>light.</b> At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the <b>light</b> from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual <b>light</b> that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that <b>light</b> had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which <b>light</b> moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that <b>light</b> must have a finite speed, and that the speed of <b>light</b> is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that <b>light</b> is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that <b>light</b> has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of <b>light</b> is much faster {{than the speed of}} sound.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use <b>light</b> {{to attract}} mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit <b>light</b> from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange <b>light</b> from the abdomen when flying and a green <b>light</b> from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They <b>light</b> up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.
