50|$|A {{pack horse}} and <b>livestock</b> <b>trail,</b> the Old Spanish Trail, {{established}} by Antonio Armijo in 1829 between New Mexico and El Pueblo de Los Ángeles, joined the Mojave River at its mouth near {{what is now}} Soda Lake. It followed the river to where the trail reached {{the foot of the}} mountains at Summit Valley and turned westward to pass over Cajon Pass and descend into the coastal valleys of southern Alta California. In 1830, Wolfskill and Yount pioneered what became the Main Route of the Old Spanish Trail, which followed a different route than Armijo, farther south just west of the Colorado River and then followed Jedediah Smith's path on the old Mohave Trail west to the Mojave River mouth at Soda Lake, to meet with Armijo's route coming south from Salt Spring.|$|E
50|$|Cattle towns, {{also known}} as “cow towns,” were midwestern {{frontier}} settlements that catered to the cattle industry. The economies of these communities were heavily dependent on the seasonal cattle drives from Texas, which brought the cowboys and the cattle that these towns relied upon. Cattle towns were found at the junctions of railroads and <b>livestock</b> <b>trails.</b> These towns were the destination of the cattle drives, {{the place where the}} cattle would be bought and shipped off to urban meatpackers, midwestern cattle feeders, or to ranchers on the central or northern plains. Cattle towns were made famous by popular accounts of rowdy cowboys and outlaws who were kept under control by local lawmen, but those depictions were mostly exaggeration and myth.|$|R
5000|$|The Lacy is {{a working}} breed, and does much better when given a job, which {{allows them to}} burn off {{excessive}} energy. Work they excel at includes herding <b>livestock,</b> blood <b>trailing</b> or tracking, treeing game, running trap lines, and hunting wild hogs. Modern activities like agility that stress intelligence, passion, speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts, and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials, or hog bays. During recent years, Lacy dogs have also become recognized for their great tracking skills, and sought after {{to be used to}} locate [...] "lost" [...] game animals.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{recreational}} and/or historical uses {{take place in}} Valles Caldera. Many of these uses involve trails. Valles Caldera has many miles of ranch roads, <b>livestock</b> and game <b>trails.</b> These include a network of trails currently designated for horse riding. [...] Historically, Valles Caldera was a location for equestrian endurance races. After establishment of VCNP, the first race in the caldera was held in 2009. The largest grass valley, Valle Grande, is a venue for ski orienteering. Activities {{are open to the}} public, though some require reservations. Customer service and concierge services are provided by the Public Lands Interpretive Association.|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{levels are}} {{the number one}} cause of water quality {{impairment}} in Texas. Several recent Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) in Texas, such as those implemented in the Peach Creek and Leon River watersheds, have identified grazing cattle as a contributor to bacterial water quality impairments in those watersheds through both direct deposition and runoff of their fecal matter to streams. To address this issue, the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board (TSSWCB) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) funded this project to assist with development and delivery of technical information and support to ranchers on protection and enhancement of the functions and values of grasslands. A number of best management practices (BMPs) have been identified to reduce bacteria runoff from grazing lands and direct deposition into streams. The primary focus of these BMPs is to maintain adequate ground cover and minimize concentrated livestock areas, especially on sensitive areas such as riparian areas. Maintaining adequate ground cover and plant density improves the filtering capacity of the vegetation and enhances water infiltration into the soil. Minimizing concentrated <b>livestock</b> areas, <b>trailing,</b> and trampling reduces soil compaction, reduces excess runoff and subsequent soil erosion, and enhances fecal matter distribution an...|$|R
40|$|A popular {{attraction}} in Texas is a horse attraction, including county and state fairs, horse races, horse shows, horse tours, rodeo and <b>livestock</b> shows, and <b>trail</b> drives/rides (Office of the Governor, Economic Development 2 ̆ 6 Tourism, 2010). The {{purpose of this}} study will be (a) to understand the under-explored area of tourists’ perception of the servicescape in horse-based tourism; (b) to investigate tourists’ perceived quality {{of the impact of the}} servicescape on emotions; and (c) to examine the relationships among perceived servicescape, emotions and behavioral intentions of visitors to horseback riding attractions in Texas. The findings of the study will provide information to horse-based service providers/tourism attractions and contribute to the development, operations, and marketing strategies of horse-based tourism...|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, {{attendance}} {{reached a}} record high of 2,611,176 people requiring over 32,000 volunteers. In 2007, the rodeo was deemed [...] "the year of the volunteer." [...] The event is 20 days long. It is kicked off by the Downtown Rodeo Roundup held near Houston City Hall, the Downtown Rodeo parade, and the ConocoPhillips Rodeo Run - a 10k and 5k walk & run and the World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest. The show features championship rodeo action, livestock competitions, concerts, a carnival, pig racing, barbecue and the Rodeo Uncorked! International Wine Competition, shopping, sales and <b>livestock</b> auctions. Traditional <b>trail</b> rides, which start in different areas of Texas and end in Houston, precede the Rodeo events. The City of Houston celebrates this event with Go Texan Day, where residents are encouraged to dress in western wear the Friday before the rodeo begins.|$|R

To address this issue, the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board (TSSWCB) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) funded this project to assist with development and delivery of technical information and support to ranchers on protection and enhancement of the functions and values of grasslands. A number of best management practices (BMPs) have been identified to reduce bacteria runoff from grazing lands and direct deposition into streams. The primary focus of these BMPs is to maintain adequate ground cover and minimize concentrated livestock areas, especially on sensitive areas such as riparian areas. Maintaining adequate ground cover and plant density improves the filtering capacity of the vegetation and enhances water infiltration into the soil. Minimizing concentrated <b>livestock</b> areas, <b>trailing,</b> and trampling reduces soil compaction, reduces excess runoff and subsequent soil erosion, and enhances fecal matter distribution and ground cover. Specific BMPs identified include grazing management, fencing, alternate water sources, hardened watering points, controlled access, supplemental feed placement, and shade or cover manipulation (NRCS 2007). This project accomplished several objectives, including: 1) compiling existing information on environmental management of grazing lands, 2) evaluating and demonstrating the effectiveness of proper grazing management in reducing bacterial runoff from grazing lands, 3) initiating evaluation {{of the effect of}} complementary practices (i. e. alternative water supplies and shade) on cattle behavior and stream water quality, and 4) promoting adoption of appropriate grazing land management practices. Evaluation and demonstration of the effect of grazing management on bacteria runoff at the USDA-ARS Riesel Watersheds has produced some interesting results. The site mean concentration of E. coli (i. e. flow weighted concentration) at the ungrazed native prairie site was surprisingly high (1. 0 E+ 04 cfu/ 100 ml), greatly exceeding the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards single sample standard for E. coli (394 cfu/ 100 ml) as well as the geometric mean (126 cfu/ 100 ml). It {{is important to note that}} these standards apply to waterbodies, such as streams and reservoirs, but not to edge-of-field runoff as described here. Also, the E. coli concentration seen in the runoff from the moderately grazed bermudagrass site (2. 3 E+ 04 cfu/ 100 ml) was significantly higher (more than double) than that observed at the native prairie site. These levels, however, are consistent with the findings of other researchers. The pre-BMP implementation evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative water supplies and shade on cattle behavior and stream water quality (E. coli) has been completed at the 2 S Ranch, near Lockhart. This evaluation showed that when alternative water was not available, E. coli levels increased as the stream flowed through the ranch. Quarterly evaluation of cattle behavior using GPS collars indicated cattle spent only 4. 5 % of the time within 35 feet of the stream when alternative water was not available. When alternative water was provided, however, this percent time that cattle spent within 35 feet of the stream was reduced to 1. 1 %, a 75 % reduction. This reduction is consistent with the findings of other researchers. Post-BMP evaluation has been initiated and will continue for another year now that alternative water and shade has been provided. Much was done through this project to increase awareness of the bacteria issue and BMPs to address them. AgriLife Extension and TWRI developed fact sheets, provided posters and presentations, conducted site tours, and developed a Web site to help disseminate information. These outreach activities reached local, state, and national audiences. The Web site alone has reached 539 unique visitors during the project. Much is left to do, however. Evaluation of grazing management, alternative water supplies, and shade will continue. Data on other practices (i. e. using rip-rap to reduce access to riparian areas, providing controlled access points, etc.) and groups of practices is still needed to provide cattlemen with a ?toolbox? for addressing the bacteria issue. Modification of water quality standards may also be appropriate to address the high levels of E. coli found in runoff from ungrazed sites. Education programs need to be conducted state- and nation-wide to assist cattlemen in addressing bacteria issues...|$|R
