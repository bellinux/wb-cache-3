The pavilion, which has a {{capacity}} of 11,000, is Grant Park's small event outdoor performing arts venue, and complements Petrillo Music Shell, the park's older and larger bandshell. Pritzker Pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, the park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> and backstage facilities. Initially the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In the Avon Valley to {{the east}} of Bath the classic {{geographical}} example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a <b>loading</b> <b>dock,</b> once used for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the <b>loading</b> <b>dock,</b> the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of {{a sufficient number}} of <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> and parking spaces for goods vehicles is an important consideration a t developments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate current queuing models that are used for this purpose. The problem that was identified is that existing queuing models are based on the assumption that service times follow an Exponential distribution while a Log-Normal distribution is more appropriate. The use of the Exponential distribution results in an overestimation of the required number of <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> and parking spaces. Service time distributions were evaluated during the study and use was made of a simulation model to estimate the required number of <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> and service times. The conclusion of the study is that existing approaches overestimate the required number of <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> and parking spaces at developments. Thesis (B Eng.

25|$|A {{signal box}} which {{contained}} 25 levers was {{situated on the}} north side of the level crossing and controlled the crossing gates as well as access to the small goods yard with a siding on each side of the line. The siding on the down side ran into a <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> behind the down platform. Unlike Ludborough, the station had no goods shed. The goods yard closed on 30 December 1963, but the station remained open to passengers until 5 October 1970. In 1956-57, around a dozen passenger trains bound for Grimsby called at the station on weekdays, with the first two being local workings from Louth, save for a Mondays only service which called only to set down passengers. In the other direction, fewer services ran through to , but the up/down passenger workings balanced once services to Louth were taken into account. North Thoresby was the only intermediate station between Grimsby and Louth to remain open until October 1970.After 1970 the down line was removed and only the up line through the station remained. The line finally closed in December 1980.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn several Norwegian cities {{there exists}} the {{potential}} for increasing the efficiency of cargo deliveries by reducing the time spent on loading and unloading for each delivery. As Norway lacks regulations harmonizing the dimensions of lorries to the dimensions of <b>loading</b> <b>docks,</b> drivers are often forced to load and unload their cargo on-street instead of onto <b>loading</b> <b>docks.</b> On-street unloading leads to increased walking distances for drivers, which increases time spent unloading the delivery and thus the delivery cost. In addition, on-street unloading may affect other road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, cars and public transportation. Harmonization of the dimensions of lorries and <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> could therefore potentially reduce both delivery costs and external effects. This paper looks into a methodological framework for social cost benefit-analyses of harmonizing the dimensions of lorries and <b>loading</b> <b>docks</b> in urban areas. The framework is universal {{in the sense that}} it is valid and can be used for evaluations of measures in different cities, however it is based on local data. The innovative part is that the adapted cost benefit-analyses methodology is used on measures connected to urban freight distribution. Another innovative aspect of using the social cost-benefit methodology is the effects of measures quantified in monetary terms. This makes it possible to rank measures tested and evaluated. The framework is tested on scenarios of current interest to be implemented by using data from the central parts of Oslo, limited by the orbital road, Ring 2. Estimations are made using four scenarios; two for estimating the effects of lorry size restrictions, and two focusing on dimensioning of <b>loading</b> <b>docks.</b> The study revealed a lack of relevant data, especially as regards <b>loading</b> <b>docks.</b> The framework can be used for similar analyses in other city areas, based on local data. An important recommendation for improving the quality of future analyses is to ensure data collection from concrete actions directed at cargo distribution in city areas...|$|R

25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E
25|$|In November 2001, club owner Marc Barnes {{opened a}} new, large, luxurious nightclub, Dream, at 1350 Okie Street NE. The four-story club had several {{extensive}} dance floors, semi-private space for patrons {{who paid for}} it, a number of bars, and catered {{to a wide range}} of races and age groups as well as people with musical tastes ranging from 1980s New Wave to hip-hop to Hi-NRG electronic dance music. The extreme popularity of Dream created several problems for Ivy City residents, including excessive traffic and parking problems, loud noise from patrons and automobiles, public urination, street fights, and even stabbings and gunfire. In an attempt to alleviate the parking problems, Dream began offering valet parking. To do so, it illegally closed the two blocks of Okie Street NE every night the club was open. Even individuals who lived on Okie Street had to pay $15 to park where they were legally entitled to do so. The club also illegally commandeered the <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> at the shuttered Hecht's warehouse for parking. The club changed its name to Love in 2005, underwent a significant renovation, and opened a fourth floor.|$|E
