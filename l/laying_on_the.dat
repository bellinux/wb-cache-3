5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

Police responded to the Chavista gunfire, with one Chavista who was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge being shot in the face, with his body positioning of lying down and facing the Metropolitan Police below possibly resulting in the headshot. Ricochets were also possible from Chavistas ranks firing through the spokes of the railing on the bridge.

500|$|The clip {{opens with}} Carlprit riding a {{sparkling}} bicycle {{in front of}} a graffiti backdrop, with Stan sitting on a TV in front of him.

Until the track's breakdown is played, the two further dance to the song, following which the singer is portrayed captured in a cage and later <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor covered by silver. The visual ends with the screen becoming dark and Stan looking into the camera. Website Direct Lyrics named the music video [...] "cute", further explaining that [...] "although nothing really happens, Alexandra just hangs around wearing different clothes in different scenes, she takes this opportunity to further strut her sexy figure." [...] Los 40 Principales cited the visual for [...] "1.000.000" [...] as one of Stan's best clips ever.|$|E

In a mixed review, Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly praised Aguilera's vocals, which [...] "reaches high enough to dust the angels with bronzer". However, Maerz criticized the overused synthesizers in the track, commenting that [...] "she could be anyone". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen wrote [...] "You can measure a singer's place in the pop-star pecking order by the quality of the Max Martin/Shellback song she releases.

500|$|Rest of the {{ensemble}} included leather, metallic combinations, green silk vest from A.F. Vandevorst, and cotton clothing from Greg Lauren. The lace shorts Madonna wore was vintage, and Åkerlund burnt up the singer's Agent Provocateur bra and applied dirt on it for giving special effects. The whole inspiration for Åkerlund behind the look was Jonas, {{as well as the}} couple's interest in rock-n-roll. Madonna approved the design, saying that [...] "It was magical... It perfectly represented the vibe that we wanted to bring to the video." [...] She also asked for a golf club and pocket knife to make the look more edgy. With Swedish broadcasting channel Sveriges Television, Åkerlund explained that for the opening shot, where Madonna is shown <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, she wanted boots which looked like leg braces. She contacted a designer in New York who said that he developed such pieces for fetish fashion. Åkerlund wanted him to provide the designs for arms also.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{watched the}} episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010, and {{also found that}} the {{character}} of Jameson was [...] "thoroughly unlikable". He described Rohner as [...] "acting like a Muppet when he's supposed to be elderly and weak, then <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> over-heated angst once his youth is restored". Overall he felt that the main characters were sidelined in the episode, and so it was difficult to be involved in what went on. He gave the episode a grade of C+. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation in June 2007. She said that the plot seen in [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] involving an [...] "Evil Admiral" [...] was one which had been more commonly seen on The Original Series such as Commodore Decker in [...] "". She too criticised the makeup used on Rohner, but said that his acting became more [...] "modulated, but then both Karnas and the actor playing him seem over-the-top by comparison".|$|E

500|$|The badnjak (Cyrillic: бадњак, [...] ), {{also called}} veseljak (весељак, , {{literally}} [...] "jovial one" [...] in Serbian), is {{a tree branch}} or young tree brought {{into the house and}} placed on the fire on the evening of Christmas Eve, a central tradition in Serbian Christmas celebrations much like a yule log in other European traditions. The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The felling, preparation, bringing in, and <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire, are surrounded by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. The burning of the log is accompanied by prayers that the coming year brings food, happiness, love, luck, and riches. The log burns on throughout Christmas Day, when the first visitor strikes it with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly, while wishing that the family's happiness and prosperity be as abundant as the sparks. As most Serbs today live in towns and cities, the badnjak is often symbolically represented by a cluster of oak twigs with brown leaves attached, with which the home is decorated on Christmas Eve.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store, {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album.

The concept behind the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] revolves around Beyoncé leading a revolution. The video begins with quick shots of a desolate parking lot. Beyoncé then appears with a balaclava which she uses to cover her face up to the eyes. She is seen walking slowly towards the camera, as other people start joining her with flags and bats in their hands. Later in the video, she takes the mask off and the people surrounding her set [...] various objects on fire using Molotov cocktails, write graffiti on walls, and break a car. Beyoncé is later seen holding a man with a mask who is <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The end of the video sees the protesting group facing a line of SWAT policemen. They start running towards them and as the video comes to its end Beyoncé holds hands with the person next to her which is the same man she hugged {{on the ground in the}} previous scene. For the look in the video, she donned a cropped T-shirt, pants designed by Åkerlund, a green scarf by Michael Schmidt, shoes by Rodarte and rings by Lynn Ban.|$|E
