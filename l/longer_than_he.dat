During {{the second day of}} filming, Grace – who was Roger Moore's stunt double for the scene – carried on doing the scene <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> should have, due to a miscommunication with the second unit director, and the train entered a section of the track which the team had not properly surveyed. Shortly afterwards, a concrete pole fractured Grace's left leg.|$|E
5|$|After the Canadian {{government}} withdrew promised {{financial support}} for the expedition, the delay in finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again second in command, and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist. Worsley was the master of the Quest, but would also be the expedition's hydrographer.|$|E

25|$|Drumm was intelligent, shrewd, {{and very}} pessimistic. He saw Charlie {{as the son}} he never had, and offered him the unsentimental advice to regard his Da as his enemy, someone who'd hold him back from {{succeeding}} in life. Drumm advised Charlie to emigrate from Ireland, which {{was no place for}} an ambitious young man. However, Charlie instead took a job as Drumm's clerk. He imagined the job would be only temporary, but he ended up working for Drumm for 14 years. Like his Da, Charlie kept an unprestigious, low-paying job far <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> ever intended to.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney {{criticized the}} Obama Administration for holding General Motors stock for <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> thought prudent. He {{said that the}} {{government}} should sell its General Motors stock holdings quickly and should seek alternatives to what he called excessive automotive industry regulation. He also said that fuel economy standards should be determined by market forces rather than by government mandates, and he called electric vehicles “a technology that people aren’t interested in.” GM and Chrysler have denied that their post-bailout returns to the Chinese market are attempts to outsource American jobs, as Romney claimed from a since corrected report by Bloomberg News.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had intended. As a Chief Qadi, his skills were highly {{desirable}} in the formerly Buddhist nation that had recently converted to Islam. Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking no notice when he complained. From the Maldives, he carried on to Sri Lanka and visited Sri Pada and Tenavaram temple.|$|E

25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

I'd say, well, we play a very particular style that you should really know about." [...] The group chose Doug Scharin, who had attended Codeine's first show in Boston.|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated at {{the time}} that he was {{disappointed}} in his performance; he had wanted to remain on his toes <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had. Jackson subsequently said that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was one of his favorite songs to perform live, but only when he did not have to do it the way he had on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. [...] "The audience wants a certain thing—I have to do the moonwalk in that spot," [...] he later said. [...] "I'd like to do a different version." ...|$|E

500|$|Bova {{planned to}} stay for five years, to ensure a smooth {{transition}} after Campbell's sudden death; the salary was too low for him to consider remaining indefinitely. [...] In 1975, he proposed a new magazine to Condé Nast management, to be titled Tomorrow Magazine; he wanted to publish articles about science and technology, leavened with some science-fiction stories. [...] Condé Nast was not interested, and refused to assist Analog with marketing or promotions. [...] Bova resigned in June 1978, having stayed for a little <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had planned, and recommended Stanley Schmidt to succeed him. [...] Schmidt's first issue was December 1978, though material purchased by Bova continued to appear for several months.|$|E
500|$|Franco {{developed}} an aptitude for art—painting in particular—during {{his high school}} years while attending the California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA). Franco has said painting was the [...] "outlet" [...] he needed in high school, and he [...] "has actually been painting <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> has been acting". His paintings were displayed publicly {{for the first time}} at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E
500|$|Having {{witnessed}} the 11 September 2001 attacks from the JFK airport tarmac, McCartney {{was inspired to}} take {{a leading role in}} organising the Concert for New York City. His studio album release in November that year, Driving Rain, included the song [...] "Freedom", written in response to the attacks. The following year, McCartney went out on tour with a band that included guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, accompanied by Paul [...] "Wix" [...] Wickens on keyboards and Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums. They began the Driving World Tour in April 2002, which included stops in the US, Mexico and Japan. The tour resulted in the double live album Back in the US, released internationally in 2003 as Back in the World. The tour earned a reported $126.2million, an average of over $2million per night, and Billboard named it the top tour of the year. The team continued to play together and McCartney played live with Brian Ray, Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel Jr. and Wix Wickens <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> played live with the Beatles.|$|E

500|$|The Downward Spirals {{release date}} was delayed {{at various times}} to slow down Reznor's {{intended}} pace of the album's recording. The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on Broken and Pretty Hate Machine. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a writer's block as {{he was unable to}} produce any satisfactory material. Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress, but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom. He told rock music producer Rick Rubin that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished, thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard. Reznor realized {{that he was in the}} most fortunate situation he imagined when the album was recorded with a normal budget, [...] "cool" [...] equipment, and a studio to work at.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Tripathi {{confirmed}} {{that from the}} next month he would start penning the third installment of the trilogy, The Oath of the Vayuputras. In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, people will die in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|Since García Márquez was eighteen, he {{had wanted}} to write a novel based on his grandparents' house where he grew up. However, he {{struggled}} with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco. [...] He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing. [...] He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote, but writing the novel took far <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> expected, and he wrote every day for eighteen months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord. During the eighteen months of writing, García Márquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and Álvaro Mutis, and María Luisa Elío and Jomí García Ascot, every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions. Fortunately, when the book was finally published in 1967 it became his most commercially successful novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, which sold more than 30 million copies (Cien años de soledad) (1967; English translation by Gregory Rabassa 1970) and was dedicated “Para (to) Jomí García Ascot y María Luisa Elío”. The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of Macondo, through their trials and tribulations, instances of incest, births and deaths. The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez's native Aracataca.|$|E

500|$|Amenhotep was deified {{upon his}} death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el-Medina. His mother, who lived {{at least one year}} <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As {{previously}} mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep's statuary {{comes in the form of}} a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: [...] "Amenhotep of the Town," [...] "Amenhotep Beloved of Amun," [...] and [...] "Amenhotep of the Forecourt," [...] and was known as a god who produced oracles. Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod (or be caused to nod) the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the [...] "spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep," [...] which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the [...] "great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town." [...] Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month was named after this festival, [...] "Phamenoth." [...] Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep's accession to the throne.|$|E
500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E

Marcus was grateful {{that he did not have}} to live with her <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did. Marcus thanks the gods that he did not lose his virginity before its due time, and even held out a bit longer.

60|$|Mahomed Reza Khân was now {{invested}} {{again with}} his office; but {{such was the}} treachery of Mr. Hastings, that, though he wrote to the Nabob that this was done in consequence of the orders of the Company, he did clandestinely, according to his usual mode, assure the Nabob that Mahomed Reza Khân should not hold the place <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> till <b>he</b> heard from England. He then wrote him another letter, that he should hold it no <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> while <b>he</b> submitted to his present necessity, (thus giving up to his colleague what he refused to the Company,) and engaged, privately, that he would dismiss Mahomed Reza Khân again. And accordingly, the moment he thought Mr. Francis {{was not in a}} condition to give him trouble any longer, that moment he again turned out Mahomed Reza Khân from that general superintendence of affairs which the Company gave him, and deposed him as a minister, leaving him only a very confined authority as a magistrate.|$|R
