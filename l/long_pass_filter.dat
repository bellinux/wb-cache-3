40|$|A {{system for}} imaging a flame and the {{background}} scene is discussed. The flame imaging system {{consists of two}} charge-coupled-device (CCD) cameras. One camera uses a 800 nm <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> which during overcast conditions blocks sufficient background light so the hydrogen flame is brighter than the background light, and the second CCD camera uses a 1100 nm <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter,</b> which blocks the solar background in full sunshine conditions such that the hydrogen flame is brighter than the solar background. Two electronic viewfinders convert the signal from the cameras into a visible image. The operator can select the appropriate filtered camera to use depending on the current light conditions.

40|$|A {{number of}} visual, {{chemical}} and fluorescence-based methods are generally employed for monitoring of algae cell growth, culture health and biomass concentration. These methods are often time-consuming, demand destructive and high volume sampling. Rapid, efficient, cost-effective and automated methods which facilitate high-throughput and non-destructive sampling would highly benefit microalgae biotechnology. It {{is known in}} literature that with flow cytometry {{it is possible to}} monitor microalgae growth and microalgae culture health. Flow cytometry, however, has not been used to estimate biomass release and cell disruption yield. In this study with representative cultures of Chlorella sp., flow cytometry data were generated by a <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> (> 670 nm) and proved to be a promising technique to rapidly evaluate these parameters during cell disruption by bead milling. Both a laboratory and a commercial culture of Chlorella were bead milled. Prior to and during bead milling, biomass release was evaluated gravimetrically and the cell count was determined via hemocytometer manual counting and 3 flow cytometry methods: 1) direct event count of a certain population, 2) quadrant-upper right event count of a <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> (> 670 nm) and 3) a calculation based on the <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> data. The data of all methods were compared and correlated to gravimetric biomass release data. Manual counting resulted in an underestimation of the cell disruption yield as one of the Chlorella cultures manual counts did not agree with biomass release data. Good correlations for both cultures were found for cell disruption yield calculations based on flow cytometry data and gravimetric biomass release data. Flow cytometry is therefore an efficient analytical method to rapidly screen disruption yields during cell disruption in microalgae and can be a substitute for the time-consuming direct methods (e. g. gravimetric, manual counting) for estimating biomass release and cell disruption yield. </p...|$|E

This article presents {{an overview of the}} survey, its selection function and HST imaging observations. The sample was selected from the GALEX+SDSS catalogue at z= 0. 028 - 0. 19, in order to allow Lya to be captured with combinations of <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> in the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) of HST/ACS. In addition, LARS utilises Halpha and Hbeta narrow, and U, B, i broad-band imaging with ACS and WFC 3.

The sample of 14 galaxies covers far UV (FUV) luminosities that overlaps with those of high-z Lya emitters and Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We present the reduction steps used to obtain the Lya images, including our LARS eXtraction software (LaXs) which utilises pixel-by-pixel spectral synthesis fitting to subtract the continuum at Lya. We demonstrate that the use of SBC <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> dramatically increase the signal to noise compared to the nominal Lya filter in SBC. To exemplify, we present results for Mrk 259. This irregular galaxy shows extended but strongly asymmetric Lya emission. Spectroscopy from HST/COS show a moderate outflow in the neutral ISM and an asymmetric Lya profile. Radiative transfer modeling is able to reproduce the Lya line profile, confirming the presence of an outflow. The integrated photometry provides a Lya luminosity of 1. 3 E 42 erg/s an equivalent width W(Lya) = 45 Å and a FUV absolute magnitude - 19. 2.

30|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging {{is based}} on evaluation of the average time that electronically excited fluorophore stays in that excited state before its transition to a ground state, accompanied by photon emission in a longer wavelength [10]. As a result, <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering</b> {{can be used to}} eliminate the excitation light and increase dramatically the signal to noise ratio. It has been shown that fluorescence lifetime is largely independent of the concentration of the fluorophores and the intensity of the excitation light.

This property makes the fluorescence lifetime imaging a promising candidate for detecting and monitoring cancer-specific receptors in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

Spectrum splitting, where light is optically distributed among subcells with differing bandgaps, avoids these constraints and offers a route to achieving higher efficiencies (< 50 %). We investigate a spectrum splitting approach where concentrated sunlight is trapped in a textured dielectric slab and then selectively coupled into underlying solar cells of different bandgaps through omnidirectional filters. We develop a multipass optical model to find regimes of high optical efficiency based on parameters such as slab refractive index, number of subcells, and angle restriction of light escape from the slab.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of a pulsed laser emitting at two different wavelengths increases the effectiveness of the lifetime imaging technique for mapping the presence of emissions from pigments on painted surfaces. Laser-induced luminescence spectra from different areas of the objects and traditional digital imaging, using led-based lamps, <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filters</b> and a commercial photographic camera, complement the results from photoluminescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the versatility of a new instrumental setup, capable of recording decay emission kinetics with lifetimes from nanosecond to microseconds. Conclusions: While the combined wavelength approach for the imaging of emissions from different materials has been demonstrated for the study of ancient Egyptian pigments (both organic and inorganic), the method could be extended to the analysis of modern pigments and paintings...|$|R
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is based}} on the uptake of a {{photosensitizer}} followed by its photosensitization through a selective irradiation, which induce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. In this work the effect of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) was evaluated during photodynamic treatment. We have used as experimental system four cell lines: COLO 829 (primary melanoma), A 2058 (metastatic melanoma), BJ- 5 ta (human immortalized fibroblasts), SH-SY 5 Y (human neuroblastoma). 5 -ALA is the precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the biosynthetic pathway of heme. PpIX is a potent photosensitizer, thus leading to an ALA-based PDT. When exogenous 5 -ALA is added to culture medium, the production of cellular PpIX can be induced. We have verified the intracellular production of PpIX in the above mentioned cell lines after treatment with different concentration of 5 -ALA for various times in the dark. Fluorimetric analysis has shown a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence intensity up to 0. 3 mM 5 -ALA after 6 hours of incubation. Hence, to evaluate the 5 -ALA photocytotoxicity effect, the cells were incubated with 0. 3 mM 5 -ALA for 6 hours in the dark. After incubation, the cells were irradiated with different light doses using a halogen lamp with a 520 nm <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> and a fluence rate of 2. 6 mW/cm 2. After this exposure, the cells were incubated for additional 24 hours and then the photocytotoxicity effect was evaluated. The results showed that the cytotoxic effect was proportional to the light dose and, interestingly, the metastatic melanoma cell line A 2058, is more responsive than the other cell lines used. Furthermore, analysis of expression profiles of some antioxidant enzymes, after 5 -ALA-based-PDT lead to a reduction of SOD 2 protein levels in cellular extracts of A 2058 cell. These results may provide further insights for clinical applications of PDT in cancers particularly resistant to conventional therapies...|$|E
40|$|Colloidal {{quantum dots}} (CQDs) has {{attracted}} many focuses {{during the past}} decades {{and it has been}} proven that it is a material with a great potential of fabricating low-cost and high efficiency solar cells. Also, the hot carrier and multiple exciton generation effect provide an opportunity to overcome the power efficiency limit of traditional solar cell. Moreover, by employing CQDs as absorber, the whole solar cell can be fabricated via solution process which is an advantage for large-scale production. This thesis develops a new method to synthesis PbS CQDs, investigates the anti-solvent effects on CsPbX 3 perovskite CQDs and fabricates a four-terminal tandem solar cell by combining PbS CQDSC and CsPbI 2 Br perovskite solar cell. Air-stable PbS CQDs are synthesized by using PbBr 2 as Pb precursor. This new recipe results slower reaction kinetics when compares to previous reported recipe which employs PbCl 2 as precursor. The slower reaction leads to a better size-control and uniformity. Also, high resolution EDS mapping confirms that the Br- ion passivates PbS QDs successfully which benefits the air-stability of PbS QDs. CsPb(I 0. 5 Br 0. 5) 3 QDs are synthesized via hot-injection method, and the synthesized QDs are purified by using different anti-solvents. A significant optical property change is found which indicates the halide ratio may be changed during purification process. XRD and XPS are used to confirm the hypothesis and Ab-initio simulation explains the mechanism. Finally, a four-terminal tandem solar cell consists of PbS CQDSC and CsPbI 2 Br perovskite solar cell is fabricated. By using a proper <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter,</b> the one-sun light source is used more efficient, the power efficiency is increased from 10 % to over 13 % which is a considerable improvement...|$|E
30|$|Unpolarized {{fluorescence}} spectra between 1, 600 and 5, 500  nm {{were collected}} with a 0.20 -m monochrometer. Fluorescence was induced with laser diodes gated to produce 50 -ms pulses. The diode pump powers were between 0.25 and 2.0  W. A pulse repetition rate of 10  Hz {{was used to}} synchronize a lock-in amplifier that received its input from a photo-detector mounted at the exit slits of the monochrometer. Spectra were collected using three passes - one for the 1, 100 - to 1, 700 -nm range, one for the 1, 550 - to 3, 000 -nm range, {{and one for the}} 3, 000 - to 5, 500 -nm range. An InGaAs photo-detector was used for the 1, 100 - to 1, 700 -nm range. For the other two spectral ranges that covered 1, 550 to 5, 500  nm, a liquid nitrogen-cooled InSb was used for photo-detection. For the 3, 000 - to 5, 500 -nm range, a <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> that blocked wavelengths less than 2, 500  nm was in place to eliminate the short wavelength features from appearing in higher order. Also, for spectral acquisition at wavelengths greater than 2, 500  nm, the monochrometer was purged with dry nitrogen gas in order to reduce a strong absorption feature at 4, 300  nm resulting from atmospheric CO 2. Emission was measured with the Tm 3 +:YCl 3 remaining sealed in the fused silica ampoules to prevent degradation from exposure to atmospheric moisture. Fused silica is transparent for the range of emission wavelengths studied. For Tm 3 +:KPb 2 Cl 5, no environmental precautions were used. In each case, the wavelength dependence of the complete light collection and detection system was calibrated using a blackbody source. Spectra were corrected using the system response function obtained from the blackbody calibration. To observe fluorescent decays, the laser diodes were operated in pulsed mode to pump the 3 H 4 level of Tm 3 +, and a digitizing oscilloscope recorded the transient response from the photo-detectors. During fluorescent decay measurements, the monochrometer acted as a filter to isolate emission at wavelengths associated with specific energy levels.|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} {{real-time}} results, post-mortem W phase inversions have been conducted. The {{strategy was to}} improve the signal-to-noise ratio by including a pre-inversion screening scheme using additional criterion based on measured long period pre-event noise. The solution obtained is an almost pure double couple (non-double couple = 0.7 %), with a scalar moment of 4.26 e+ 29 dyn-cm (Mw = 9.02) and a shallow dipping fault plane of 11.9 °. For the purpose of testing for a possible seismic moment variation at very long periods, we performed additional W phase inversions using increasingly <b>long</b> period band <b>pass</b> <b>filters.</b> We {{found no evidence of}} such variation, thus confirming the scalar moment value discussed above.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Autofluorescence {{bronchoscopy}} (AFB) is {{a highly}} sensitive tool {{for the detection of}} early bronchial cancers. However, its specificity remains limited due to primarily false positive results induced by hyperplasia, metaplasia and inflammation. We have investigated the potential of blue-violet backscattered light to eliminate false positive results during AFB in a clinical pilot study. METHODS: The diagnostic autofluorescence endoscopy (DAFE) system was equipped with a variable band <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> in the imaging detection path. The backscattering properties of normal and abnormal bronchial mucosae were assessed by computing the contrast between the two tissue types for blue-violet wavelengths ranging between 410 and 490 nm in 12 patients undergoing routine DAFE examination. In a second study including 6 patients we used a variable <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> (LP) <b>filter</b> to determine the spectral design of the emission filter dedicated to the detection of this blue-violet light with the DAFE system. RESULTS: (Pre-) neoplastic mucosa showed a clear wavelength dependence of the backscattering properties of blue-violet light while the reflectivity of normal, metaplastic and hyperplastic autofluorescence positive mucosa was wavelength independent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the detection of blue-violet light has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} false positive results in AFB. In addition we determined the spectral design of the emission filter dedicated to the detection of this blue-violet light with the DAFE system...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid concentrating {{solar thermal}} (CST) {{receivers}} {{allow for the}} simultaneous production of thermal and electrical energy. However, the thermal output from these receivers is typically limited by the maximum operating temperature of the solar cells, which are coupled to the thermal fluid. Spectral beam splitting provides a means for removing this direct coupling and allowing for thermal outputs significantly above the operating temperature of the photovoltaic (PV) cells. RMIT University has developed a novel beam splitting hybrid CST receiver which uses a combination of selective liquid absorption and <b>long</b> <b>pass</b> optical <b>filter</b> to spectrally split concentrated solar radiation. Using this approach light between 700 nm- 1200 nm was directed to a linear arrangement of silicon PV cells, while the remaining wavelengths of light were directly absorbed as thermal energy. A full-scale prototype receiver was mounted to a commercially available parabolic trough concentrator to measure its performance. Results demonstrated a total thermal efficiency of 46. 5 % together with an electrical yield of 3. 6 %. Sources of performance reduction were identified and discussed...|$|R
