As Amoco made plans to build liquids as a business, in 1967 the company bought a half interest in this facility.

25|$|Built in {{the early}} 1970s, Fort Saskatchewan {{supplemented}} the Edmonton <b>Liquid</b> <b>Gas</b> Plant. Key to the plant’s success was the existence underground of large salt formations. The operator was able to dissolve (“wash”) huge storage caverns in these formations. Those caverns provided large volumes of inexpensive, safe inventory capacity for the plant. Having storage capacity for NGLs enabled the company to buy and store surplus NGLs year round, including times when markets were soft and prices dropped to seasonal lows.|$|E

500|$|AlCl3 adopts three {{different}} structures, {{depending on the}} temperature and the state (solid, <b>liquid,</b> <b>gas).</b> Solid AlCl3 is a sheet-like layered cubic close packed layers. In this framework, the Al centres exhibit octahedral coordination geometry. has a more molecular structure, with the Al3+ centers occupying adjacent tetrahedral holes of the close-packed framework of Br− ions. Wells, A. F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford Press, Oxford, United Kingdom[...] In the melt, aluminium trichloride exists as the dimer Al2Cl6, with tetracoordinate aluminium. This change in structure {{is related to the}} lower density of the liquid phase (1.78g/cm3) vs solid aluminium trichloride (2.48g/cm3). Al2Cl6 dimers are also found in the vapour phase. At higher temperatures, the Al2Cl6 dimers dissociate into trigonal planar AlCl3, which is structurally analogous to BF3. The melt conducts electricity poorly, unlike more ionic halides such as sodium chloride.|$|E
500|$|Milford Haven ( [...] ; , meaning [...] "mouth {{of the two}} Rivers Cleddau") is a {{town and}} {{community}} in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is situated {{on the north side}} of the Milford Haven Waterway, an estuary forming a natural harbour that has been used as a port since the Middle Ages. The town was founded in 1790 {{on the north side of}} the Waterway, from which it takes its name. Designed to a grid pattern, it was originally intended by the founder, Sir William Hamilton, to be a whaling centre, though by 1800 it was developing as a Royal Navy dockyard which it remained until the dockyard was transferred to Pembroke in 1814. It then became a commercial dock, with the focus moving in the 1960s, after the construction of an oil refinery built by the Esso Company, to logistics for fuel oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>gas.</b> By 2010 the town's port has become the fourth largest in the United Kingdom in terms of tonnage, and plays an important role in the United Kingdom's energy sector with several oil refineries and one of the biggest LNG terminals in the world.|$|E

500|$|In Liew Sai Wah v. Public Prosecutor (1968), the {{appellant}} {{was arrested}} at the Singapore train station for having six grenade bodies in his bag. He was charged and found guilty of possession of ammunition by the High Court, and sentenced to death. The conviction was upheld by the Federal Court of Malaysia (then part of Singapore's court hierarchy). However, on further appeal to the Privy Council, their Lordships held that grenade bodies did not come within the term ammunition, which was defined as [...] "ammunition for any fire-arm as hereafter defined and includes grenades, bombs and other like missiles whether capable of use with such a fire-arm or not and any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any noxious <b>liquid,</b> <b>gas</b> or other thing". Counsel for the Public Prosecutor suggested that grenade bodies might fall within the definition of explosive, which includes [...] "any material for making an explosive and any apparatus, machine, implement or material used or intended to be used or adapted for causing or aiding in causing any explosion in or with any explosive, and any part of any such apparatus, machine or implement". However, the Privy Council declined to allow this submission as it involved the presentation of a case completely different {{to the one that}} the appellant was required to meet during his trial and the appeal before the Federal Court. The appellant was therefore acquitted.|$|E

2500|$|A mass {{spectrometer}} {{consists of three}} components: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. The ionizer converts {{a portion of the}} sample into ions. [...] There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase (solid, <b>liquid,</b> <b>gas)</b> of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and onto the detector. [...] The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a multichannel plate.|$|E
