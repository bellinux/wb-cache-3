50|$|In 1957, {{governor}} of Bank Indonesia Sjafruddin Prawiranegara commissioned {{a new series}} of notes from English printer, Thomas De La Rue & Co.

Specimens were produced in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 rupiah, and the first of these to be brought into circulation were the 100 and 1000 rupiah notes, in 1958, due to the counterfeiting of these denominations of the 1952 series (the counterfeit notes can be distinguished by the wavy <b>line</b> <b>watermark</b> being printed onto the paper rather than a true watermark).|$|E

There are seventeen stamps in this issue which occur in denominations ranging from ½-cent to 50-dollars which were printed on double <b>lined</b> <b>watermarked</b> paper.

50|$|The three Documentary stamps {{issued in}} the 1898 series (which were {{actually}} issued in 1899) feature the portraits of John Marshall, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, each bearing the inscription Series of 1898.

As an added security measure each of these high value stamps was given its own unique serial number. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing the issues of 1898 were printed on white wove paper and watermarked with the initials U.S.I.R. (i.e. United States Internal revenue) in block capital letters. The stamps were separated by rouletted perforations.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} project – initiated late in 2012 – {{to use the}} chain line patterns apparent in beta-radiographs of the prints of Rembrandt to help identify mold-mates, i. e. papers made from the same mold, among those prints lacking watermarks. Background An ultimate objective of technical examination of laid papers is to help determine their date and location of manufacture. Prior to the mid- 18 th century laid papers were made by scooping paper pulp with a mold comprised of a screen within a rectangular wooden frame (Hunter, 1978) (Loeber, 1982). The screen allowed the water to drain from the pulp leaving {{a sheet of paper}} – sized by the borders of the frame – that would be removed to dry. The mold-based procedure for producing laid papers described in (Hunter, 1978) and (Loeber, 1982), leaves impressed features, including chain and laid <b>lines</b> and <b>watermarks,</b> detectable as thinner locations on a sheet of paper. Transmitted light photographs and beta-radiographs are often proposed for revealing these impressions as the thinner portions of the paper impede the signal less and therefore stand out in the image produced. Transmitted light photographs have the disadvantag...|$|R
50|$|Rees's Cyclopædia {{was printed}} by Andrew Strahan, the King's Printer. It was entirely {{hand-set}} (there being no mechanical means of composition at this date) and printed. At {{the commencement of}} the work Strahan had nine wooden presses and over 20,000 kg of type. By 1809 this had risen to fifteen wooden presses and 36,000 kg of type. Since the Cyclopædia was produced serially, with a few sheets being printed each week, {{only a small part}} of Strahan's men and equipment would have ever been used on it at any one time. The work was printed on demy paper and folded to quarto format, with an uncropped size of 11 ¼ inches by 8 ¾ inches. A limited number were advertised in the prospectus as being produced on royal paper, which when folded gave a format of 12 ¼ inches by 10 inches. The paper is wove, with no chain <b>lines.</b> One <b>watermark</b> in the paper has been noted, with the legend W BALSTON, 1811. The supplier has not been identified, but it may be significant that a J. Dickinson was a member of the publishing syndicate.|$|R

40|$|Binary Watermarking, robust to {{printing}} and scanning, {{is the process}} of imperceptibly hiding information in binary documents, typically text documents, so that the hidden information can still be recovered following the {{printing and}} scanning of a document. It presents a challenging problem, both in finding an imperceptible way to hide data within a sparse text document, and providing an embedding strategy that can handle the myriad of distortions introduced during printing and scanning. Our goal was to develop a scheme that had sufficient capacity to embed our proposed authenticating and localising watermark. Existing schemes did not provide sufficient capacity, requiring us to develop techniques to increase the embedding capacity whilst maintaining the robustness to printing and scanning. In this thesis we present two distinct approaches to binary watermarking robust to printing and scanning. Our first approach, Binary Text Watermarking, is based on the principle of adjusting white space between adjacent words in order to embed a watermark, and forms the main focus of this thesis. A fundamental requirement of Binary Text Watermarking is the correct classification of white space, which is a difficult task due to the variation between different fonts, font sizes and the small tolerances between success and failure. The task is compounded by the requirement to classify white space in the same way, following printing and scanning, and even photocopying. The techniques we have proposed: Frequency Thresholding, Frequency Shaping and PDF Analysis have been designed to cope with distortion and mitigate against the possibility of misclassification. We have analysed 864 test documents to validate our white space classification techniques. In doing so we have discovered a number of interesting characteristics associated with the distribution of white space within documents. In order to increase available embedding capacity within a document we have proposed a new set allocation process in the form of Continuous <b>Line</b> <b>Watermarking.</b> In addition we have introduced two new set modulation techniques: Quad Set Watermarking and Ternary Watermarking. We have achieved an overall increase in capacity of 174 %, in comparison to previous work, whilst mainting robustness to printing and scanning, and even photocopying. In order to validate this we printed and scanned 504 test documents, consisting of different fonts and variants of our scheme. We have developed an end-user application that provides a fully featured user interface to allow users to analyse, embed, detect and authenticate documents using our watermarking schemes. Our second approach to binary watermarking is our Imperceptible Yellow Printer Dots method, which is orthogonal to our Binary Text Watermarking method. The concept is based on the methods used by printer manufacturers to identify the printer on which the document was printed. The method relies on the imperfections of the human visual system, which prevent humans seeing tiny yellow dots on white paper. The novelty of our approach is the automatic embedding and detection of a custom watermark using an off-the-shelf printer and scanner. It must handle similar distortions to those incurred by our Binary Text Watermarking method, whilst still successfully finding the tiny yellow dots. Our proposed, Imperceptible Yellow Printer Dots, scheme provides a capacity over 18 times greater than our Binary Text Watermarking method...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the Internet in the past years has rapidly increased the availability of digital data such as audio, images, text and videos to the public. Thus, the problem of protecting multimedia information {{becomes more and more}} important. As a solution, Digital Watermarking is the most common and possibly strongest technique for protecting digital data. Digital watermarking is the process of embedding information into a digital signal. The signal may be audio, pictures, Text or video. The embedded information is known as a watermark that can be extracted or detected. &# 13; With the wide spread use of the Internet in our society, the distribution and access of information is greatly facilitated. However, without methods which prevent or discourage illicit redistribution and reproduction of information content, copyright can be easily infringed. Text watermarking is widely believed to be a valid solution to the problem and this paper presents the study of new method of <b>line</b> shift text <b>watermarking</b> technique. In this technique, the locations of text lines vertically shift to encode the document. So the encoded document cannot be accessed by any other unauthorized person...|$|R
