5|$|For a time, Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing. The {{birth of}} her fourth child, Percy Florence, on 12 November 1819, finally <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> spirits, though she nursed {{the memory of her}} lost {{children}} till the end of her life.|$|E
5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> head {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E

25|$|On the Sunday {{prior to}} 6 November, a Russian galiot that Tartar had {{captured}} was laying stranded at Montrose. The river had carried her and deposited {{her on the}} beach.

25|$|At about 7:30p.m. on March 8, 1977, Columbia University student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, {{was walking}} home from school when she was confronted by an armed man. She lived about a block from where Christine Freund was shot. In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> {{textbooks}} between herself and her killer, but the makeshift shield was penetrated, the bullet striking her head and killing her.|$|E

25|$|R. A. Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she {{was being}} watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley playfully skipped on stage, <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> rifle, and aimed the barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a {{whizzing}} bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth.|$|E
25|$|Kasperek {{had little}} success {{in her first}} season in New Zealand, with her eight matches {{yielding}} only 86 runs and a single wicket. For the 2013–14 season, she switched to the Otago Sparks (based in Dunedin), {{and went on to}} score two half-centuries. Kasperek impressed more with her bowling, taking 18 wickets to finish as the competition's leading wicket-taker, including figures of 6/8 in one match against Canterbury. The next season, she returned 15 wickets to be Otago's leading wickettaker and equal-fourth in the competition, but also <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> batting, scoring 313 runs to place behind only Suzie Bates for Otago (and tenth in the competition).|$|E
25|$|Shoshone {{was then}} taken further downriver, making the run over Celilo Falls, itself always {{reckoned}} a hazardous stretch, on June 28, 1870. Once below Celilo, she ran as a cattle boat between the upper Cascades and The Dalles. Later {{she was taken}} over the Cascades {{and down to the}} Willamette River, where she was sold to the Willamette River Transportation Company. The W.R.T. Co. then hauled Shoshone up around Willamette Falls, and ran her on the upper Willamette and also on the Yamhill River. There, perhaps surprisingly for a boat that had run Hells Canyon, she struck a rock near Salem, Oregon in the fall of 1874 and sank. Efforts to raise her failed, although her machinery was salvaged, and later installed in Champion. In January 1875, rising water <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> free, and washed her down river to Lincoln. There a farmer salvaged her cabins, hauled them ashore, and turned them into a chicken coops.|$|E

25|$|The Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} in 3-0 {{ruling on}} July 17, 2013 Judge’s Forrest ruling which struck down § 1021(b)(2) {{of the controversial}} U.S. military-detention law NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Court of Appeals overturned Forrest’s decision in a 60-page ruling and <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> injunction, saying that Christopher Hedges and another plaintiff weren’t eligible to challenge the law because it “simply says nothing about the government’s authority to detain citizens.” The court held that under their interpretation the government could not use the particular law challenged by the citizen plaintiffs to militarily detain them, so they had no basis for the court to hear their case. But the court acknowledged that this doesn’t mean that the government could not rely on other laws, including the AUMF {{to the events of}} September 11, to justify indefinite military detention of citizens. The court concluded that the non-citizen plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of being detained and thus could not have their challenge of the law adjudicated by the court. “And while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad, the non-citizen plaintiffs also have failed to establish standing because they have not shown a sufficient threat that the government will detain them under Section 1021,” the court said.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 37 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Gerðr is {{introduced}} by the enthroned figure of High {{as the daughter of}} Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða, and is described as [...] "the most beautiful of all women". High reports that Freyr went into Hlidskjalf and looked over all worlds. When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building. A woman went to the building, and when she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> arms and {{opened the door to the}} building [...] "light was shed from her arms over both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her". In punishment for [...] "his great presumption" [...] in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.|$|E

To save Mushroom Kingdom, rescue Peach, get the castle back, and defeat Bowser, Mario must locate the Star Spirits, who can negate the effects of the stolen Star Rod, by defeating Bowser's minions guarding the star spirits. The player controls Mario and a number of partners to solve puzzles in the game's overworld and defeat enemies in a turn-based battle system. The battles are unique in that the player can influence the effectiveness of attacks by performing required controller inputs known as [...] "action commands".|$|E

500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] {{was given}} its first live {{performance}} on February 12, 2012, at the 54th Grammy Awards. The performance began with [...] "E.T." [...] with dancers and a singer {{who appeared to}} be Perry on a darkened stage. It ended partway through the chorus as electronic sound effects and the lights and sound suddenly went out, implying technical difficulties. Wearing sunglasses and a metallic bodysuit with the appearance of golden armor, a blue-haired Perry, slowly singing the first part of [...] "Part of Me," [...] descended from the roof of the venue in a transparent cube, revealing the singer on the stage below to be a body double. Perry shattered the cube, fireworks went off around the stage, and Perry began [...] "Part of Me" [...] as the dancers present during [...] "E.T." [...] reappeared, <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> up, and performed a routine behind her.|$|E
500|$|At 00:40 {{the entire}} convoy and nearby U-boats were jolted {{by a very}} heavy {{explosion}} {{thought to have been}} one of the largest prior to atomic bomb testing. The explosion stopped the engine of the tug Uncas rescuing survivors six miles astern of the convoy. SS Titus was rescuing survivors from Empire Lynx when the explosion <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> bow so violently the crew believed Titus had been torpedoed. The crew abandoned ship before the master realized Titus was undamaged and reboarded to sail to England with a skeleton crew including some Empire Lynx and Hatimura survivors. Titus was drydocked upon arrival in England, but the only damage found was a small dent in her port side. U-132 is believed to have been destroyed by the explosion. The cause [...] of the explosion is unknown, but it is assumed to have resulted from detonation of the ammunition cargo aboard either Hobbema or Hatimura. In all, 19 Allied ships were sunk from convoy SC 107.|$|E
500|$|... "Glitter in the Air" [...] was {{performed}} by Pink on her 2009 Funhouse Tour. After the first encore of the tour–"Get the Party Started" [...] from Missundaztood–Pink returned to the stage wearing a black robe, as glitter fell from the ceiling. Pink would begin singing while walking {{to the center of}} the runway extension of the stage. There, she took off the robe to reveal a white leotard and joined three female acrobats covered in glitter on suspension rigging which then lifted into the air. Pink continued through the song, twirling in suspended fabric above the audience. Underneath her, the acrobats performed, according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "slow-motion, geometric Cirque du Soleil poses". The apparatus dropped her into a tank of water and <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> again to the air, before descending her at the end of the performance. Michael Menachem of Billboard commented, [...] "When Pink finally touched down, she continued singing with bombast, as though the entire spectacle had been no sweat. If the rest of the show hadn't already made the case that Pink has one of the best pop-rock voices—and the most brazen moves—of her generation of stars, this final moment certainly did".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{success of their}} debut studio album Fallen (2003) and its accompanying tour (2003–04), Evanescence returned to the studio to work on material for a new album. During that time, guitarist Ben Moody parted ways with the band and the group sued their previous record manager. In addition to that, the replacement guitarist for Moody, Terry Balsamo suffered from a stroke during {{the final stages of}} recording, which further extended the time needed to release and finalize the album. The Open Door was eventually finished and set for release in October 2006. For the songwriting process on the album, Amy Lee mostly collaborated with Balsamo whom she described as a partner who <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> up and helped her pass the point of refraining when composing. [...] "Lithium" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, solely by Lee. During an interview with VH1, she revealed that she had written the song on a guitar when she was 16-years old, but never used it in any of her projects despite her liking of its chorus. During the band's work on The Open Door, Lee rearranged the song on a piano and wrote its verses. [...] Lee describes the song as one [...] "which embraces feeling over numbness". In another interview with MTV Italy, Lee elaborated on the meaning behind the song's lyrics, ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently <b>lifted</b> <b>her.</b> Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning." [...] In a poll conducted by Billboard, the performance was ranked as the fourth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
