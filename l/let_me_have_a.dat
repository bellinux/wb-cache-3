500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs}} of their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Winston Churchill {{wrote to}} General Ismay on 12 July 1940 saying: [...] "I saw these pillboxes {{for the first}} time when I visited Langley last week. This appears to afford an admirable means of anti-parachute defence and it should surely be widely adopted. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plan." [...] This pillbox was adopted by the Air Ministry and became known as the Pickett-Hamilton fort.|$|E

"He <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very fast, short-pitched delivery...Instinctively I {{turned a}} {{defensive}} {{back on the}} ball which skidded through and hit me a sickening blow {{on the back of}} my head. I sank to the ground and as I slipped in and out of consciousness, I was dimly aware of the players gathering round my prostrate body. Indistinctly I heard my fellow batsman Bill Edrich saying: 'My God, Lindy, you've killed him!'...I was very, very angry with Ray Lindwall. And the whole of the Aussie team knew it...I would return the bouncer with interest!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
