5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only <b>lessens</b> each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region {{as a whole is}} less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie's sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), {{gives birth}} to a baby girl that she names Amy, to Danielle's surprise. Ronnie's dislike of her <b>lessens</b> with time, and when Danielle falls out with Stacey and ends up {{squatting}} in a flat owned by landlord Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Ronnie convinces him not to call the police.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes <b>lessens</b> the pain of grief itself.|$|E

50|$|Sleeping {{in a more}} upright {{position}} seems to <b>lessen</b> catathrenia (as well as sleep apnea). Performing regular aerobic exercise, where steady breathing is necessary (running, cycling etc.) may <b>lessen</b> catathrenia. Strength exercise, on the other hand, may worsen catathrenia because of the tendency to hold one's breath while exercising. Yoga and/or meditation focused on steady and regular breathing may <b>lessen</b> catathrenia.|$|R
5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers <b>lessens</b> vignetting.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and <b>lessens</b> the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which <b>lessens</b> {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, {{operators}} of ranges might consider adding sound transmission barriers, absorptive materials, and natural vegetation to <b>lessen</b> noise emission. Fans pointing downrange can provide air {{movement away from}} shooters to <b>lessen</b> lead exposure.|$|R

50|$|Open lung {{ventilation}}n - Open {{lung ventilation}} is a ventilatory strategy that combines small tidal volumes (to <b>lessen</b> alveolar overdistension) and an applied PEEP above the low inflection {{point on the}} pressure-volume curve (to <b>lessen</b> cyclic atelectasis).|$|R
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils <b>lessens</b> the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which <b>lessens</b> its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor <b>lessens</b> the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
60|$|The {{consequences}} of those adventures are generally such as these: first, that they stock-starve the tradesman, and impoverish {{him in his}} ordinary business, which is the main support of his family; they <b>lessen</b> his strength, and while his trade is not <b>lessened,</b> yet his stock is lessened; and as they very rarely add to his credit, so, if they <b>lessen</b> the man's stock, they weaken him in the main, and he must at last faint under it.|$|R

25|$|In 2011, the Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX) was opened, which <b>lessened</b> {{the heavy}} volume of {{vehicles}} on Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor. This project decreased the traffic congestion in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor, so travel time from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay is <b>lessened</b> {{to only one}} hour.|$|R
5|$|Months later, {{in an act}} {{of revenge}} on Kenshin, Yukishiro Enishi fakes Kamiya Kaoru's death. Kenshin loses the will to live and when Sanosuke is unable to reach him, he wanders away from Tokyo. In his wandering, he is reunited with his family in the Shinano Province (Shinshū). Years {{prior to the start of}} the series, Sanosuke left the family at the age of 9 to join the Sekihō Army. Although he does not reveal his {{identity}} to his family, upon learning of their poor situation Sanosuke attacks a former Ishin Shishi who was mistreating them and the town. During these fights, Sanosuke's right hand is permanently damaged from the overuse Futae no Kiwami. and overcomes this disability when he discovers using both hands in succession which <b>lessens</b> the impact to his damaged hand. After protecting his family, he returns to Tokyo to rescue Kaoru with his friends. After a successful rescue, Sanosuke leaves Japan and travels the world to avoid being arrested for attacking the Ishin Shishi. The manga ends with a letter from Sanosuke to his friends that he is returning to Japan to be reunited with them.|$|E

25|$|From Bostancı onwards the {{economic}} level progressively <b>lessens,</b> {{so there are}} more retired and working-class residents here. There are no more villas, excepting some on the coast at Dragos, and the apartment buildings are narrower and less widely spaced. Bostancı itself is a busy shopping district built around a railway station.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{this fast}} differs from most other fasts {{established}} in the Jewish calendar in that this fast is not indicated in the Hebrew Scriptures.
