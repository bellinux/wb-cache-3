The related variable, , holds the {{hostname}} of the server that authenticated the current user's <b>logon</b> credentials (<b>name</b> and password). For home PCs and PCs in a workgroup, the authenticating server is usually the PC itself. For PCs in a Windows domain, the authenticating server is a domain controller (a primary domain controller, or PDC, in Windows NT 4-based domains).|$|R

40|$|There are no doubts. We owe wavelet {{analysis}} to Jean Morlet. How did Morlet discover wavelets? Here is the story. During {{the late seventies}} Morlet {{was working as a}} geophysicist for the Elf-Aquitaine company. He had to process the backscattered seismic signals which carry the information related to the geological layers. These seismic signals present transient patterns. Processing such signals with conventional tools such as windowed Fourier analysis or Gabor wavelets often creates numerical artifacts. Morlet elaborated wavelet {{analysis to}} overcome this problem. Quoting the geophysicist Pierre Goupillaud, A product of the renowned Ecole Polytechnique, Morlet performed the exceptional feat of discovering a novel mathematical tool which has made the Fourier transform obsolete after 200 years of uses and abuses, particularly in its fast version. Goupillaud is exaggerating. Around 1945, Léon Brillouin, Dennis Gabor, Claude Shannon, and Jean Ville were already aware of the limitations of the Fourier transformation. They were looking at some timefrequency representations which would play the role of an audiogram or a sonogram for audio signals [1]. Gabor conjectured that his famous wavelets w(k,l) (x) = exp(2 πilx) exp(−(x − k) 2 / 2), (k, l) ∈ Z 2 might be the building blocks (or time-frequency atoms) of speech signals. That is why he often used the <b>name</b> <b>logons</b> to refer to what we name Gabor wavelets. More precisely, Gabor suggested that any signal f(x) could be written as a linear combination of logons: f(x) = c(k, l) w(k,l) (x) (2...|$|R
