30|$|Cainkar ([2002 a]) {{reports that}} on August 12, 2002 the DOJ {{finalized}} plans requiring {{thousands of visitors}} from predominately Muslim nations to provide fingerprints to the US government upon arrival {{in the country and}} to register with INS after 30 days. Otherwise <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors</b> who failed to provide fingerprints or to register with the INS could be fined or deported.|$|R
500|$|The Act next {{establishes}} a uniform duty towards all <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors,</b> thus abolishing {{the distinction between}} contractors, invitees and licensees. Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors,</b> although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed to go or how long they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|R
5000|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 is {{concerned}} with <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors.</b> It was originally the contention of the claimant that he had implicit permission {{to be on the}} premises, though he was later forced to concede that the duty, if any, was owed to him under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, which {{is concerned}} with persons other than visitors, (most commonly trespassers), predominantly because the defendant had no idea the claimant was on their premises, nor did they have any reason to suspect he may be.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} {{originally}} heard by His Honour Judge Bowers in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. Here, the claimant succeeded, though {{was forced to}} concede his duty was owed to him under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, which deals with trespassers, {{as opposed to the}} Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, which deals with <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors.</b> The claimant also had his damages reduced by 75% due to his contributory negligence.The subsequent appeal from the defendant (against the imposition of a duty of care) was heard in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales by three Lords Justice of Appeal: Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, Lord Justice Brooke, and Lord Justice Laws.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors,</b> not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{legal issue}} before the Law Lords {{was whether the}} brewery fell {{within the scope of}} the Act as [...] "occupier". The leading speech was {{delivered}} by Lord Denning. He defined the [...] "occupier" [...] as a person who has sufficient control over the premises {{to the extent that he}} ought to realise that lack of care on his part can cause damage to his <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors.</b> The duty may be shared between several occupiers, who will be jointly and severally liable to the visitors if they both fail to exercise the due care, causing injury. If the property is let, the owner will be considered occupier to all parts of the premises that are not let by demise, such as the common staircase. Where the owner did not let by demise, but merely licensed the property (i.e. allowed another person to live on it), he will be considered occupier of the entire space because he would retain the right and the duty to do repairs. In both cases he will be occupier jointly with the tenant. A contractor doing work on the premises can also be classed as occupier in certain circumstances, whether or not jointly with the owner.|$|R
40|$|The case of Sri Inai (Pulau Pinang) Sdn Bhd v Yong Yit Swee & Ors[would {{have gone}} largely unnoticed as a routine appeal on the duties owed by a {{landlord}} to <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors</b> of his/her tenant if one {{had not taken}} note {{of one of the}} submissions put forward for consideration before the High Court. The fact that this submission was actually made by counsel was due either to an ignorance of one of the fundamentals of the law on negligence, or a very audacious attempt at changing the law that has stood since Donoghue v Stevenson. 1 Ever since the groundbreaking efforts of Lord Atkin and the majority of the House of Lords 3 more than 70 years ago, there was no requirement in negligence that a claimant had to have a pre-existing contractual relationship with the defendant to establish a duty of care. The High Court's application of an even older English authority opened up the possibility of a revival of the pre-Donoghue common law position in Malaysian law. The Court of Appeal consisting of Gopal Sri Ram JCA, Abdul Kadir Sulaiman JCA and Alauddin JCA in Sri Inai (Pulau Pinang) Sdn Bhd was therefore presented with an opportunity to either reaffirm the well-established rule in Donoghue or regressing to the dark ages of the common law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{the doctrine}} of occupiers’ liability {{for the safety of}} child trespassers has been developed in English Law over the last 100 years by applying Pierre Bourdieu’s theorising on the operation of the ‘juridical field’ (Bourdieu 1987). The analysis traces the evolution across the ‘no duty’ dictum of Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) –v- Dumbreck (1929), the ‘duty of humanity’ advanced in British Railways Board –v- Herrington (1972), the qualified duty of care introduced by the Occupiers Liability Act 1984 following the Law Commission, Report on Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers, Cmnd 6428 (1976) and the subsequent interpretation of that duty in case law such as Tomlinson –v- Congleton Borough Council (2002) and Mann v Northern Electric Distribution Ltd (2010). The paper analyses {{the ways in which the}} judiciary’s operation as an ‘interpretive community’ (Fish, 1980; 1989) has steered this evolution and the ways in which external, supra-juridical, factors have also influenced how occupiers’ liability law has been interpreted and applied. The analysis is based upon a doctrinal and narrative analysis of the key cases, policy and legislative instalments. This analysis includes assessment of how child trespassers have been depicted and their motivations interpreted by English judges; evaluation of the impact of the 1984 Act; the influence of parallel developments in other common law jurisdictions and the interaction of occupiers’ liability law with other ‘safety’ based legislation. The analysis shows how within the broad policy and legal framework set by legislators, the common law and the 1957 and 1984 Occupiers’ Liability Acts, the courts have marked out (and pragmatically adjusted) the limits of the ‘reasonable’ safety provision required of occupiers for <b>lawful</b> <b>visitors</b> and trespassers...|$|R
