Indeed, before his departure, the lawyer showed us there had already gone abroad some glimmerings of the truth.|$|E

This example, Fig. 2 in Plate 27 is {{sufficiently}} {{characteristic of the}} purist mediæval landscape, though there is somewhat more leaning to naturalism than is usual at the period. The next example, Fig. 3, is from Turner's vignette of St. Anne's Hill (Rogers's Poems, p. 214). Turner almost always groups his trees, so that I have had difficulty in finding one {{on a small scale}} and isolated, which would be characteristic of him; nor is this one completely so, for I had no access to the original vignette, it being, I believe, among the drawings that have been kept from the public, now these four years, because the Chancery <b>lawyers</b> <b>do</b> not choose to determine the meaning of Turner's perfectly intelligible, though informal, will; and Mr. Goodall's engraving, which I have copied, though right in many respects, is not representative of the dotted touch by which Turner expressed the aspen foliage. I have not, however, ventured to alter it, except only by adding the extremities where they were hidden in the vignette by the trelliswork above.|$|E
60|$|In {{this case}} {{there was no}} {{question}} of payment. The advice to be given was to a widowed woman from an experienced man of the world; but, nevertheless, he could only make his calculations as to her peculiar case {{in the way in which}} he ordinarily calculated. Could it be possible that anything had been kept back from him? Were there facts unknown to him, but known to her, which would be terrible, fatal, damning to his sweet friend if proved before all the world? He could not bring himself to ask her, but yet it was so material that he should know! Twenty years ago, at the time of the trial, he had at one time thought,--it hardly matters to tell what, but those thoughts had not been favourable to her cause. Then his mind had altered, and he had learned,--as <b>lawyers</b> <b>do</b> learn,--to believe in his own case. And when the day of triumph had come, he had triumphed loudly, commiserating his dear friend for the unjust suffering to which she had been subjected, and speaking in no low or modified tone as to the grasping, greedy cruelty of that man of Groby Park. Nevertheless, through it all, he had felt that Round and Crook had not made the most of their case.|$|E

'He is not; I do {{not think}} he will come thither again until the {{business}} of the stake-nets be hushed up, nor would I advise him to do so--the Quakers, with all their demureness, can bear malice as long as other folk; and though I have not the prudence of Mr. Provost, who refuses to ken where his friends are concealed during adversity, lest, perchance, he should be asked to contribute to their relief, yet I {{do not think}} it necessary or prudent to inquire into Redgauntlet's wanderings, poor man, but wish to remain at perfect freedom to answer, if asked at, that I ken nothing of the matter. You must, then, go to old Tom Trumbull's at Annan,--Tam Turnpenny, as they call him,--and he is sure either to know where Redgauntlet is himself, or to find some one who can give a shrewd guess. But you must attend that old Turnpenny will answer no question on such a subject without you give him the passport, which at present you must do, by asking him the age of the moon; if he answers, [...] "Not light enough to land a cargo," [...] you are to answer, [...] "Then plague on Aberdeen Almanacks," [...] and upon that he will hold free intercourse with you. And now, I would advise you to lose no time, for the parole is often changed--and take care of yourself among these moonlight lads, for laws and <b>lawyers</b> <b>do</b> not stand very high in their favour.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{reader of}} a novel,--who has doubtless taken the volume up simply for amusement, {{and who would}} {{probably}} lay it down did he suspect that instruction, like a snake in the grass, like physic beneath the sugar, was to be imposed upon him,--requires from his author chiefly this, that he shall be amused by a narrative in which elevated sentiment prevails, and gratified by being made {{to feel that the}} elevated sentiments described are exactly his own. When the heroine is nobly true to her lover, to her friend, or to her duty, through all persecution, the girl who reads declares to herself that she also would have been a Jeannie Deans had Fate and Fortune given her an Effie as a sister. The bald-headed old lawyer,--for bald-headed old <b>lawyers</b> <b>do</b> read novels,--who interests himself in the high-minded, self-devoting chivalry of a Colonel Newcombe, believes he would have acted as did the Colonel had he been so tried. What youth in his imagination cannot be as brave, and as loving, though as hopeless in his love, as Harry Esmond? Alas, no one will wish to be as was Ralph Newton! But for one Harry Esmond, there are fifty Ralph Newtons,--five hundred and fifty of them; and the very youth whose bosom glows with admiration as he reads of Harry,--who exults in the idea that as Harry did, so would he have done,--lives as Ralph lived, is less noble, less persistent, less of a man even than was Ralph Newton.|$|E
6000|$|Eleventh Privilege. The {{advantage}} {{that he has}} that has the Lord Jesus for his Advocate is very great. Thy Advocate has the cause, has the law, has the judge, has the purse, and so consequently has all that is requisite for an Advocate to have, since together with these he has heart, he has wisdom, he has courage, and loves {{to make the best}} improvement of his advantages for the benefit of his client; and that which adds to all is, he can prove the debt paid, about which Satan makes such ado-a price given for the ransom of my soul and for the pardon of my sins. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>do</b> use to make a great matter of it, when they can prove, that that very debt is paid for which their client is sued at law. Now this Christ Jesus himself is witness to; yea, he himself has paid it, and that out of his own purse, for us, with his own hands, before and upon the mercy-seat, according as the law requireth (Lev 16:13-15; Heb 9:11-24). What then can accrue to our enemy? or what advantage can he get by his thus vexing and troubling the children of the Most High? Certainly nothing, but, as has been said already, to be cast down; for the kingdom of our God, which is a kingdom of grace, and the power of his Christ will prevail. Samson's power lay in his hair, but Christ's power, his power to deliver us from the accusation and charge of Satan, lieth in the worth of his undertakings. And hence it is said again, [...] "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb," [...] and he was cast out and down (Rev 12:10-12). And thus much for the privileges that those are made partakers of, who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate.|$|E
6000|$|But frankly he said, [...] "My dear lady, my boy has {{but five}} hundred a year, {{and a wife}} with ten {{thousand}} pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him. We could do better for him than that, permit me to say, {{and he is a}} shrewd, cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats now--who has very good parts and plenty of ambition--and whose object in marrying is to better himself. If you and Sir Francis chose--and Sir Francis, take my word for it, will refuse you nothing--you could put Arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world, and show the stuff which he has in him. Of what use is that seat in Parliament to Clavering, who scarcely ever shows his face in the House, or speaks a word there? I'm told by gentlemen who heard my boy at Oxbridge, that he was famous as an orator, begad!--and once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him, I've no doubt he won't be the last of the field, ma'am. I've tested the chap, and know him pretty well, I think. He is much too lazy, and careless, and flighty a fellow, to make a jog-trot journey, and arrive, as your <b>lawyers</b> <b>do,</b> {{at the end of their}} lives! but give him a start and good friends, and an opportunity, and take my word for it, he'll make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of. I don't see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir, but by making a prudent marriage--not with a beggarly heiress--to sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a year--but with somebody whom he can help, and who can help him forward in the world, and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country, begad, in return for the advantages which she brings him. It would be better for you to have a distinguished son-in-law, than to keep your husband on in Parliament, who's of no good to himself or to anybody else there, and that's, I say, why I've been interested about you, and offer you what I think a good bargain for both." ...|$|E
