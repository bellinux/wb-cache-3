60|$|The poet's bust is {{affixed to}} the {{northern}} wall of the church, the base of it being about a man's height, or rather more, above {{the floor of the}} chancel. The features of this piece of sculpture are entirely unlike any portrait of Shakespeare that I have ever seen, and compel me to take down the beautiful, lofty-browed, and noble picture of him which has hitherto hung in my mental portrait-gallery. The bust cannot be said to represent a beautiful face or an eminently noble head; but it clutches firmly hold of one's sense of reality and insists upon your accepting it, if not as Shakespeare the poet, yet as the wealthy burgher of Stratford, the friend of John a' Combe, who lies yonder in the corner. I know not what the phrenologists say to the bust. The forehead is but moderately developed, and retreats somewhat, {{the upper part of the}} skull rising pyramidally; the eyes are prominent almost beyond the penthouse of the brow; the upper lip is so long that it must have been almost a deformity, unless the sculptor artistically exaggerated its length, in consideration, that, on the pedestal, it must be foreshortened by being <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>from</b> <b>below.</b> On the whole, Shakespeare must have had a singular rather than a prepossessing face; and it is wonderful how, with this bust before its eyes, the world has persisted in maintaining an erroneous notion of his appearance, allowing painters and sculptors to foist their idealized nonsense on its all, instead of the genuine man. For my part, the Shakespeare of my mind's eye is henceforth to be a personage of a ruddy English complexion, with a reasonably capacious brow, intelligent and quickly observant eyes, a nose curved slightly outward, a long, queer upper lip, with the mouth a little unclosed beneath it, and cheeks considerably developed in the lower part and beneath the chin. But when Shakespeare was himself (for nine tenths of the time, according to all appearances, he was but the burgher of Stratford), he doubtless shone through this dull mask and transfigured it into the face of an angel.|$|E
60|$|Crossing over a plank {{and through}} a very narrow opening in the wall, we entered into what Mrs Mackenzie called her domain -- namely, the flower garden, the beauty of which is really beyond my power to describe. I do not think I ever saw such roses, gardenias, or camellias (all reared from seeds or {{cuttings}} sent from England); {{and there was also}} a patch given up to a collection of bulbous roots mostly collected by Miss Flossie, Mr Mackenzie's little daughter, from the surrounding country, some of which were surpassingly beautiful. In the middle of this garden, and exactly opposite the veranda, a beautiful fountain of clear water bubbled up from the ground, and fell into a stone-work basin which had been carefully built to receive it, whence the overflow found its way by means of a drain to the moat round the outer wall, this moat in its turn serving as a reservoir, whence an unfailing supply of water was available to irrigate all the gardens below. The house itself, a massively built single-storied building, was roofed with slabs of stone, and had a handsome veranda in front. It was built on three sides of a square, the fourth side being taken up by the kitchens, which stood separate from the house -- a very good plan in a hot country. In the centre of this square thus formed was, perhaps, the most remarkable object that we had yet seen in this charming place, and that was a single tree of the conifer tribe, varieties of which grow freely on the highlands of this part of Africa. This splendid tree, which Mr Mackenzie informed us was a landmark for fifty miles round, and which we had ourselves seen for the last forty miles of our journey, must have been nearly three hundred feet in height, the trunk measuring about sixteen feet in diameter at a yard from the ground. For some seventy feet it rose a beautiful tapering brown pillar without a single branch, but at that height splendid dark green boughs, which, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>from</b> <b>below,</b> had the appearance of gigantic fern-leaves, sprang out horizontally from the trunk, projecting right over the house and flower-garden, to both of which they furnished a grateful proportion of shade, without -- being so high up -- offering any impediment to the passage of light and air.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} mistaken {{identity}} states that sharks, especially white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, mistake surfers for pinnipeds when <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them <b>from</b> <b>below</b> and thus bite them erroneously. Photographs of surfer wounds and board damage were interpreted with special emphasis on shark size, wound severity, and extent of damage to a board. These were compared with the concurrent literature on attack strategies of white sharks on pinnipeds and their outcomes. The {{results show that the}} majority of damage to surfers and their boards is at best superficial-to-moderate in nature and does not reflect the level of damage needed to immobilize or stun a pinniped. It is further shown that the size distribution of sharks biting surfers differs from that in pinnipeds. The results presented show that the theory {{of mistaken identity}}, where white sharks erroneously mistake surfers for pinnipeds, does not hold true and should be rejected...|$|R

Instead I show how they fought to find their own way, how they put themselves out there, and how much they had to swallow in order to find themselves. I am fascinated by how they overcome obstacles in order to achieve their goals. Hildegard von Bingen had a dream of founding her own abbey, and she suffered a lot of setbacks in the process. The moments of her greatest weakness are when the nun Richardis is to be taken away from her. In this situation, she behaves either like a small, abandoned child, or with fury. This conduct is all recorded in her letters. And it is precisely these moments of extreme self-abandonment that I find so beautiful, surprising, and contradictory. Hildegard von Bingen demands for herself what she usually gives to others. I absolutely did not want to portray her as a saint." ...|$|R

40|$|In the German population, men are {{on average}} 13 cm taller than women [1]. Smaller people, {{many of them}} women, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other faces <b>from</b> <b>below</b> (viewing angle) while tall people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> others <b>from</b> above. The minimal {{distance}} between 2 persons not engaged in mutual gaze is around 50 cm [2]. Thus, with regard to male and female average statures, in close-up situations, the average viewing angle {{between males and females}} is around 13 deg. Do people have therefore different “preferred” representations of faces depending on their stature? More specifically, are tall and small people more efficient at processing face seen “from above” and from “below” respectively? Furthermore, do observers have different “preferred” representations of male and female faces because men are on average taller than women? To investigate the influence of stature and sex on face recognition, we first investigated whether efficiency in a sex classification task might be influenced by face orientation. To maximize stature differences between participants, we tested two groups: small women (under 165 cm) and tall men (over 180 cm). If face representation is influenced by stature, we expect small women to be more efficient (faster) at processing faces viewed as seen <b>from</b> <b>below</b> and vice-versa for tall men. Furthermore, because of natural average stature differences between men and women, efficient categorization of male and female faces might depend on their orientation. We used unfamiliar male and female faces shown at pitch angles between - 18 deg (looking downward) to + 18 deg (looking upward). We tested participants in a speeded sex classification task. Male and female participants saw 220 faces one by one and had to classify them as male or female as fast as possible. Classification accuracy was high (over 95). Analysis of reaction times does not show any relation between stature of observer, sex of shown face and its pitch orientation, thus suggesting that face processing with regards to sex is not influenced predominantly by stature of observer or sex of presented face...|$|R
5000|$|.....Then {{there was}} Li Cheng, who when he {{depicted}} pavilions and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, pagodas and the like, {{always used to}} paint the eaves as seen <b>from</b> <b>below.</b> His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small {{from the viewpoint of}} the large...just as one <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> them <b>from</b> <b>below,</b> one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that {{is going on in the}} valleys and canyons, and in the lanes and courtyards with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings? Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in shan shui style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting Birds and Plum Blossoms, housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; Qiu Ying is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the Wu School and the Zhe School.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} making of race {{and the politics of}} belonging in Costa Rica between 1921 and 1950, during a period of shifting racial borders and entangled terrains of power. While the idea of "racial democracy" and official discourses of mestizaje (racial mixing) predominate in Latin America, Costa Rica has been long held as a unique country in Central America with an exceptional social geography characterized by "whiteness" and homogeneity. Employed in the United Fruit Company enclave in the Atlantic region of Limón since the late nineteenth century but not formally granted citizenship until 1949, persons of British West Indian origin posed alternative claims to racial belonging, based heavily on the language and ideas of Garveyism [...] the Pan-African political philosophy of Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The surge of anti-imperial protest against the United Fruit Company in the 1920 s and the subsequent renegotiation of the Company's contract in 1934 transferred the centers of banana production from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, where "persons of color" were prohibited from employment. This process re-drew the borders of the nation and initiated the "Costa Ricanization" of Limón. Theorizing Limón as a borderland formed by the encounters of U. S., Central American, and Caribbean ideas of race, this dissertation maps the convergences and divergences of two distinct yet interwoven articulations of racial citizenship in Costa Rica; one West Indian, Garveyite, and black, and the other criollo-identified and white. Utilizing interdisciplinary research methods and critical theories of race and diaspora, this project employs an analytical lens that engages the national and transnational politics of race, and the relationship between space, power, discourse, and visual culture in the making and contestation of racial belonging. This dissertation draws from the fields of African Diaspora Studies, Latin American Studies, Intellectual History, Cultural Geography, Women's Studies, and Media Studies to analyze the languages, logics, signifiers, and imageries of racial belonging, reading newspapers and petitions as "counterarchives" and key sites where Costa Ricans and West Indians forged cultures of redemption and contours of citizenship, putting them on the record. Introducing the concept of "redemptive geographies," the discursive spaces and territorial claims in which Costa Ricans and West Indians negotiated modern subjectivity and "diasporic" identity, this dissertation examines the re-mapping of the European and African diasporas alongside articulations of belonging to the Costa Rican nation. Costa Ricans re-formulated criollo whiteness and re-inscribed a mythology of homogeneity based on an identification with the Spanish settlers of the colonial past. The idea of national whiteness reinforced the outsider status of West Indians and was also an anti-imperial critique of the power of United Fruit in the country, which effectively reduced them to the status of colonized non-whites. Plagued with the problems of placelessness, lack of citizenship, and misrepresentation as savage threats to the Costa Rican nation, West Indians "invented" Africa in particular ways, highlighting legacies of greatness and civilization through the poetics and imageries of Garveyism to articulate black modernity and Afro-Costa Rican identity. A key function of the dissertation is to highlight the internal hierarchies and exclusions that underpin {{the making of}} these redemptive geographies, complicating the notion of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> history <b>from</b> <b>below.</b> I examine the ways Costa Rican and Garveyite ideologies of racial belonging invoked ideas and discourses of respectability, upstanding morality, and honorable behavior that drew interior borders along the lines of class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Defining and representing female honor was critical to producing and reproducing the authentic national body. I not only investigate the imageries of womanhood, motherhood, and femininity [...] including the frequent photographs of women featured in the newspapers [...] but I also analyze the ways that women theorized their own place within the projects of redemption...|$|R
