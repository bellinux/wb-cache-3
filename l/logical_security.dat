40|$|Abstract—With the {{widespread}} development of RFID technology, security and privacy issues become more prominent in RFID applications. In this paper, a new one-way hash function based mutual authentication protocol is proposed to address such security and privacy problems. Particularly, access list and pseudorandom flags are adopted for quick search, to ensure good efficiency and scalability. The proposed protocol is analyzed according to three aspects: logic, security and performance. Concretely, GNY logic formal method {{is used to}} verify the design correctness of the protocol, the attack model is {{used to analyze the}} security, and the performance is evaluated from communication overload, storage, and computation requirement. The analysis results show that the protocol has no obvious design flaws, can resist major attacks, and improves the system reliability and effectiveness. The proposed protocol can be easily scalable for lightweight RFID systems. Index Terms—authentication protocol, <b>logical</b> analysis, <b>security,</b> privacy, RFID I...|$|R

This provides the ability to extend the ADN through the LAN to a specific interface on the application enabler (POS system, server, etc.). An assigned zone will lock down a specific LAN port to a specific use.

ASF helps users to evaluate the impact of an attack, a crucial step in the attacks ranking activity. Also, we present an early prototype of ASF built on top of the popular simulator Castalia.
