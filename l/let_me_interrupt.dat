60|$|SIR OLIVER. O pray don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> Mr. Trip's Negotiation.|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{round to}} take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, [...] "But don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> Joshua's business--he has {{something}} to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I’m {{reckoning}} on that," [...] {{said the}} mate, deliberately. [...] "I’m going for’ard; don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you two. So long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At least, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> your harmony, Annot," [...] said Lord Menteith, [...] "though {{my arrival}} may breed discord elsewhere. My cousin Allan needs the {{assistance}} of your voice and music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I most cheerfully promise, worthy master," [...] said Luis, laughing, {{and taking}} a seat, [...] "even though it lead me to the ship-yard-gate. And now, Señor Pedro, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> the discourse, which I {{discovered}} was most interesting as I entered." ...|$|R
40|$|Naquin, for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> {{their own}} {{research}} with my incessant questions and aggravations; and to Jen O’Connor {{for being so}} supportive and understanding {{of all of us}} graduate students. She is the glue that binds the department! I also {{would like to thank the}} following three people for serving as my committee members: John Baker, Jon Cogburn, and Husain Sarkar. I thank Dr. Baker for having a kind ear throughout this busy semester. I thank Dr. Cogburn for his unparalleled enthusiasm and willingness to help me get started on this project. Finally, I want to give special thanks to Dr. Sarkar, whose overwhelming support, encouragement, and faith in me has been a driving force in shaping who I have become in the last several years. A person is of quite a rare breed to inspire as much strength and confidence in another as he has inspired in me...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] said Mr. Vyner, politely, as {{the other}} rose and {{straightened}} himself. [...] "What are you doing—besides decapitating worms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' {{returned}} Dick, 'I thank you. Anybody in {{the helpless}} state {{that you see}} me in, is naturally anxious. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent--excellent. I {{only wish}} there were more of it," [...] he chirruped. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt.</b> You {{were just going to}} hand over to someone, weren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The worst {{possible}} news, Duncan. I can't {{tell you about}} it now. Wait within hearing of the bell. In the mean time <b>let</b> nobody <b>interrupt</b> <b>me.</b> If the steward himself comes I can't see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very {{superior}} dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." ...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to my loving and supportive parents Wally and Sandi Gehrke and my POSSLQ Russ Davenport. Their encouragement, generosity, and patience helped me reach my goals and dreams. They have inspired and pushed {{me to be the}} best that I could be, to never give up on my aspiration, and to always work towards helping those that can often be overlooked. For that, I thank them with all of the love I have in my heart. Acknowledgements I sincerely must thank my committee. I appreciate their support, guidance, and patience as I pursued my PhD and completed this dissertation. I would especially like to thank my chair, Dr. Marilyn Kameen. She was my advisor since day one at UT and she has always been supportive and honest, and managed to find time for me in her very demanding schedule. A huge thank you also goes to Dr. Duncan and Dr. Raney for their specific insight, experience, and support. I am appreciative of Dr. Northcutt for always being so available and patient, and for helping me feel at ease with my project. And I thank Dr. Vick for not only taking the time and being willing to serve on my committee but for also <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> his vacations with my proposal defense and variou...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said, {{or rather}} hesitated, [...] "but don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your plans. I thought I heard {{something}} about--about. Salisbury. I {{have something to}} do there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. And I know that's what you're {{here for}} now. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you. It's a mighty hard job, finding that letter, and the folks'll be back by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Nothing, nothing; I--I--thought it {{was getting}} too warm. Go on, dear; don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you." [...] After a moment of heroic self-denial she softly presses the {{register}} open with her foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then lay {{him down}} on the dunghill," [...] said Owen Fitzgerald; [...] "but for heaven's sake do not <b>let</b> him <b>interrupt</b> <b>me.</b> And, Donnellan, you will {{altogether}} lose the day if you stay any longer." [...] Whereupon the captain, seeing that in very truth he was not wanted, did take himself off, casting as he went one farewell look on Aby as he lay groaning on the turf {{on the far side of}} the tuft of bushes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, listen, and don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me.</b> But first <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ask, does he {{know that}} I am {{the owner of the}} brig that was lost?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean no offense!" [...] cried Noel Vanstone, piteously. [...] "Why do you <b>interrupt</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Bygrave? Why don't you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> explain? I mean no offense." ...|$|R
6000|$|They strolled {{towards the}} swimming-baths, and {{presently}} overtook King. [...] "Oh, don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "Engaged in scientific pursuits, of course? I trust you will enjoy yourselves, my young friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He regrets {{to say he}} is {{otherwise}} engaged for the present," [...] Francine replied with spiteful politeness. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> the conversation. Who is this Miss Jethro, whose name is on everybody's lips?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sha'n't {{want you}} again till ten to-morrow morning. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] he added patronizingly to Mrs. March. He {{put his hand}} up toward his hat, and sauntered away out of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's NOT the cabbages, Mr. Harrison. I'll {{tell you}} {{everything}} [...] . that is what I came for--but please don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me.</b> It makes me so nervous. Just <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell my story and don't say anything till I get through--and then no doubt you'll say plenty," [...] Anne concluded, but in thought only.|$|R
5000|$|Da Sound: WO Ai Ni, Fascination, One in a Million, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Love You (Hex), <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Love You (Axwell), <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Love You (Club) ...|$|R

6000|$|Instead of {{instantly}} leaping {{into his}} chair and cheering himself hoarse, as the Brotherhood in public meeting assembled would infallibly have done on this cue, Mr. Crisparkle merely reversed the quiet crossing of his legs, and said mildly: ‘Don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your explanation—when you begin it.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay! I beg of you, Mesdames and Messieurs," [...] she {{now said}} quite cheerfully, [...] "do not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your conversation. Alas! do I not know its subject? [...] . . . My poor son cannot be to blame in the unfortunate affair. Lydie, though {{she may be}} wholly {{innocent}} in the matter, is singularly obstinate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there are," [...] Ezra Girdlestone remarked, {{coming into}} the room. He had been {{standing}} between the two doors {{which led to the}} counting-house, and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you. You were saying that you would blacken my father's character unless he increased your salary." ...|$|E
25|$|There <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{live and}} there <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die.|$|R
50|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> {{have all}} things, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have nothing.|$|R
50|$|Where my fathers repose. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> go, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "New at the game," [...] replied Sarah Judd, with a shrug. [...] "You don't know me, Nan, but I know you; and I {{know your}} record, too. You're as slick {{as they make}} 'em, {{and the one who}} calls herself Agatha Lord is just an {{infantile}} amateur beside you. But go ahead, Nan; don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you, Mr.--" [...] {{she was at}} a loss, as usual, for the name, and Katharine {{thought that}} she did not {{recognize}} him. [...] "I hope you've found something nice to read," [...] she added, pointing to the book upon the table. [...] "Byron--ah, Byron. I've known people who knew Lord Byron," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|After {{shaking hands}} all about, Bradley hastened to say, [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt.</b> Go on, senator. I want to listen." [...] This made a fine {{impression}} on the senator, who loved dearly to {{hear the sound of}} his own voice. He proceeded to enlarge upon his plan for gerrymandering the state--to the advantage of the Democratic party, of course.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if it's shopping, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do it!" [...] cried Mrs. Wragge. [...] "She's {{going out}} to buy her Things! Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go with her--please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go with her!" ...|$|R
50|$|To my father, the chief, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go.|$|R
50|$|To {{the bosom}} it loves. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> go, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go.|$|R
