Yossi Shain writes that in [...] "many ways [...] the participation of ethnic diasporas in shaping U.S. foreign policy is a truly positive phenomena." [...] A less positive assessment comes from Tony Smith, who writes that at [...] "present, the negative consequences of ethnic involvement may way outweigh the undoubted benefits this activism at times confers on America in world affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{traits are}} {{inherited}} {{in a more}} complicated way than the example above. This can happen when there are several genes involved, each contributing a small part to the end result. Tall people tend to have tall children because their children get a package of many alleles that each contribute a bit to how much they grow. However, there are not clear groups of [...] "short people" [...] and [...] "tall people", <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> groups of people with brown or red hair. This {{is because of the}} large number of genes involved; this makes the trait very variable and people are of many different heights. Despite a common misconception, the green/blue eye traits are also inherited in this complex inheritance model. Inheritance can also be complicated when the trait depends on interaction between genetics and environment. For example, malnutrition does not change traits like eye color, but can stunt growth.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kotaku, Kasumi {{has become}} [...] "nothing short of an icon" [...] in Japan by 2006. Talking about her {{popularity}} in the country, Itagaki said in 2004, [...] "It's almost <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too many Kasumi covers. If you look at Japanese magazines, maybe 10% of them have Kasumi on their cover." [...] She was voted the DOA series' most popular character among the Japanese fans in the publisher Koei Tecmo's official poll in 2014, receiving over 19% of votes. Kasumi has also achieved a high popularity overseas. In 2005, she won G4's show Video Game Vixens in the category 'Dressed to Kill'. That same year, Kasumi also won the [...] "Who is the hottest female character on Xbox?" [...] poll by Official Xbox Magazine, when 52% of all votes were cast on her (Street Fighters Chun-Li came second with 11%), with the magazine's staff commenting {{that it was no}} surprise to them. She won the G-Phoria 2007 award in the category [...] "Best Hottest Babe", garnering 55% of all votes, came third after Mai Shiranui from The King of Fighters and Chun-Li in a Korean Internet fan poll for White Day 2009, just as she also later did in poll for the most erotic girl in the history of fighting games conducted by Japanese web portal Goo in 2016, and was voted second in the [...] "Miss of Video Games 2012" [...] poll by Polish magazine PSX Extreme.|$|E

2500|$|Winning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on {{the opening}} day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia {{collapsed}} to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant {{that he was not}} able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. [...] "It seems <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> people trying to make a bit more of that than what it actually was," [...] Ponting said after his team's defeat. [...] "I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him know we were wanting to take pace off the ball." [...] Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons." [...] After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory.|$|E
