5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} at six Queens Boulevard Line stations, including 75th Avenue, were <b>lengthened</b> {{to allow}} eleven-car trains. The {{bid for the}} project went out in 1951. The <b>lengthened</b> trains began running during rush hour on September 8, 1953. Eleven-car trains would only operate on weekdays. The extra car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.|$|E

40|$|Limb-lengthening {{procedures}} {{include a}} series of radiographic examinations to follow the <b>lengthening</b> process and callus formation. We quantified ionizing radiation exposure during <b>lengthening</b> treatment and estimated {{the risks associated with}} this exposure in 53 patients undergoing <b>lengthening</b> procedures. Field size and tube voltage of all radiographs and fluoroscopy time during surgery were recorded. According to conversion factor tables of organ doses, the cumulative organ dose was estimated. Location of <b>lengthening,</b> age, complications during <b>lengthening</b> procedure, range of <b>lengthening,</b> healing index, and other factors affecting the duration of the <b>lengthening</b> procedures were analyzed. Average <b>lengthening</b> was 4. 8  cm (range, 3. 0 – 12. 5  cm). The average cumulative organ dose for a straight <b>lengthening</b> procedure was 3. 1  mSv (range, 0. 2 – 12. 5  mSv). The average organ dose per centimeter of <b>lengthening</b> was 0. 7  mSv/cm (range, 0. 03 – 5. 9  mSv/cm). Doses for patients with tibial <b>lengthening</b> (0. 3  mSv/cm) were less than doses for patients with femoral <b>lengthening</b> (1. 1  mSv/cm). Age, complications, range of <b>lengthening,</b> and healing index did not influence the dosage of radiation per centimeter <b>lengthening.</b> We judge the average patient’s exposure during a limb-lengthening procedure as tolerable, but femur <b>lengthening</b> results in a higher cumulative organ dose...|$|R
30|$|For {{logistic}} {{and practical}} reasons, we performed the daily <b>lengthening</b> in a non-fractionated manner. We {{are aware that}} quasi-continuous <b>lengthening</b> produces better bone formation, and that, in humans, <b>lengthening</b> seems to be optimal when undertaken {{four times a day}} (for example, 1  mm of <b>lengthening</b> per day should be accomplished using a 0.25 -mm <b>lengthening</b> four times a day) [11, 12, 13]. However, our <b>lengthening</b> regimen was the same for all our animals, and the results obtained were consistent in all the sheep within the same <b>lengthening</b> group. Therefore, we believe that our results are scientifically valid and clinically relevant.|$|R
30|$|We plan to <b>lengthen</b> 60  mm due to {{increased}} complications with bigger <b>lengthening.</b> We will use an external fixator and <b>lengthen</b> via the femoral CORA to correct the valgus deformity in the same procedure. In the future, the patient will need another <b>lengthening</b> procedure or a contralateral epiphysiodesis.|$|R

30|$|Research and {{progress}} in medical devices {{have led to}} constant improvement in outcomes of limb <b>lengthening</b> [8]. Since the first <b>lengthening</b> performed {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth-century, many have contributed to the development of various limb <b>lengthening</b> techniques, using the principles of external fixation and <b>lengthening</b> nails [1].|$|R
30|$|The {{indications}} for {{an upper}} limb <b>lengthening</b> are less common {{than those for}} a lower limb <b>lengthening.</b> Consequently, the management, indications, risks, and potential complications of procedures for <b>lengthening</b> of the upper limb, {{as well as the}} results of these procedures, are less well codified than those for a femoral and/or tibial <b>lengthening.</b>|$|R
30|$|Full <b>lengthening</b> was {{achieved}} in one patient (patient G.K.). Two patients (Y.G. and T.K.) had a residual discrepancy of 5  mm, {{and due to}} reduced shoulder motion (Y.G.) and elbow motion (T.K.) a minor difference was tolerated. In patient M.J. <b>lengthening</b> was terminated leaving the left humerus 1  cm short compared with the right side. After 4  cm of intramedullary nail <b>lengthening</b> (and a total of 9  cm <b>lengthening</b> due to prior 5  cm extramedullary <b>lengthening</b> with an Ilizarov fixator in childhood), the humeral head migrated proximal and the shoulder abduction declined, so <b>lengthening</b> was terminated.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts <b>lengthened,</b> and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was <b>lengthened</b> slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E

5|$|However, without Newcastle's {{infantry}}, {{and with}} his own infantry exhausted from their long march on the previous day, Rupert was unable to attack, and the odds against him <b>lengthened</b> as the day wore on, and the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry and artillery returned from their aborted move south and took position.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the manifestation of}} prosodic <b>lengthening</b> in child-directed speech with the adult-directed speech of 6 Catalan and English women.

30|$|Bifocal <b>lengthening</b> is {{used when}} the target <b>lengthening</b> is {{in excess of}} 5 – 6  cm at a single {{osteotomy}} site. This is to avoid deformity that may occur when a greater amount of <b>lengthening</b> is attempted from a single site. The surgeon should be aware and anticipate the higher rate of soft tissue problems and greater pain with bifocal <b>lengthening.</b> Accordingly, bifocal <b>lengthening</b> should be used judiciously and not for congenital longitudinal deficiency of the femur.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lengthening</b> beyond 25 % of the {{original}} segment length is an orthopaedic challenge. Substantial <b>lengthening</b> is fraught with complications such as joint contractures, refractures, nerve injuries and prolonged periods of consolidation. We report a case of massive <b>lengthening</b> in a 17 -year-old boy in whom a 20 cm <b>lengthening</b> (57 % <b>lengthening)</b> and complex deformity correction was performed on a centralized fibula using the Ilizarov technique, with an excellent result. A total of 17 months were taken to complete the process of <b>lengthening</b> and consolidation at a healing index of 0. 85 months/cm. Besides a minor pin tract infection, there were no major complications. We believe that with meticulous pre operative plan-ning and follow-up the extent of <b>lengthening</b> can be extended in cases of severe limb length discrepancy...|$|R
5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, <b>lengthened</b> it.

5|$|The {{lower level}} of the Archer Avenue Subway would be {{extended}} parallel to the LIRR Main Line to 188th Street in Hollis, Queens; the Jamaica El east of 121st Street would be demolished because it was redundant to the new subway.

5|$|This {{project would}} also enable the {{platforms}} at Herne Hill to be <b>lengthened</b> to accommodate 12-car trains {{as the current}} northern junction, which prevents them from being extended, would be removed. However, longer trains {{could not be used}} on the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop without also rebuilding Tulse Hill and Elephant & Castle.|$|E
30|$|Gradual {{development}} of varus and procurvatum occurs with proximal femoral <b>lengthening,</b> {{irrespective of the}} type of external fixator device used. With circular systems, the possibility of correction of the deformity after <b>lengthening</b> is useful. Some monolateral rail systems also posses adjustable clamps (e.g. the micrometric swivel clamp of the Orthofix LRS) that allow the correction of the varus component to be reduced but, being a device applied in the coronal plane, correction of procurvatum is more difficult. In general, this deformity is not a clinically significant issue in subtrochanteric <b>lengthening</b> if the target <b>lengthening</b> is kept 5 – 6  cm. Should the surgeon wish to achieve a greater length using a monolateral device, consideration should then be given for bifocal femoral <b>lengthening</b> where it is possible to achieve 5  cm of <b>lengthening</b> at each osteotomy site. Bifocal femoral <b>lengthening</b> should not be used for <b>lengthening</b> for congenital pathologies (especially longitudinal deficiency of the femur) as the tension created in the soft tissues will become excessive.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{over the last few}} decades have {{established}} that the control strategy employed by the nervous system during <b>lengthening</b> (eccentric) differs from those used during shortening (concentric) and isometric contractions. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the neural control of <b>lengthening</b> contractions. After a brief discussion of methodological issues that can confound the comparison between <b>lengthening</b> and shortening actions, the review provides evidence that untrained individuals are usually unable to fully activate their muscles during a maximal <b>lengthening</b> contraction and that motor unit activity during submaximal <b>lengthening</b> actions differs from that during shortening actions. Contrary to common knowledge, however, more recent studies have found that the recruitment order of motor units is similar during submaximal shortening and <b>lengthening</b> contractions, but that discharge rate is systematically lower during <b>lengthening</b> actions. Subsequently, the review examines the mechanisms responsible for the specific control of maximal and submaximal <b>lengthening</b> contractions as reported by recent studies on the modulation of cortical and spinal excitability. As similar modulation has been observed regardless of contraction intensity, it appears that spinal and corticospinal excitability are reduced during <b>lengthening</b> compared with shortening and isometric contractions. Nonetheless, the modulation observed during <b>lengthening</b> contractions is mainly attributable to inhibition at the spinal level. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} of <b>lengthening</b> nails {{should be kept}} in mind, as severe cruciate aplasia and joint incongruity (ball and socket joint) can lead to subluxation. Cases of subluxation during <b>lengthening</b> with motorised intramedullary <b>lengthening</b> nails have been reported [16, 28].|$|R
5|$|Tu-142: A <b>lengthened</b> Tu-95 {{with much}} {{defensive}} armament removed, and instead incorporating ASW systems. Twelve aircraft initially had 12-wheel main undercarriage bogies. Six later aircraft had four-wheel bogies. Built by Kuibyshev Aviation Plant.|$|E
5|$|Two-seat trainer {{version of}} F-105D with <b>lengthened</b> forward fuselage. It was fully combat-capable and had dual controls, taller fin, and {{increased}} takeoff weight; its first flight {{took place on}} 11 June 1963. A total of 143 were built.

5|$|Between 1907 and 1910, {{the ships}} {{of the class}} were heavily rebuilt, with the {{exception}} of Kaiser Karl der Grosse. During the modernization, the ships had their superstructures cut down. Four 15cm guns and one torpedo tube were also removed. The ships' 8.8cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15cm guns had been located. Also, the smoke stacks were <b>lengthened.</b>|$|E
30|$|All cases {{included}} some leg <b>lengthening.</b> There were no cases of axial corrections without any <b>lengthening</b> procedure. The <b>lengthening</b> procedures in cases with major axial deformities {{were performed to}} allow a gradual correction of the deformity without impingement of the segments.|$|R
30|$|In {{an earlier}} study, {{we showed that}} {{transferring}} the gracilis and semitendinosus to the adductor tubercle had similar benefits to <b>lengthening</b> alone on knee function when compared to traditional <b>lengthening,</b> but, in addition, preserved hip extension power [4]. This study examines the longer term data of outcomes of patients undergoing hamstring <b>lengthening</b> plus transfers (HST) compared with a cohort who underwent traditional hamstring <b>lengthening</b> alone surgery (HSL).|$|R
30|$|The {{drawbacks}} in {{this study}} are a small number of cases, <b>lengthening</b> of different limb segments and the use of <b>lengthening</b> devices in both groups. However, the study does indicate that early substitution of external fixation for internal fixation can bring benefits but needs to be balanced against potential risks of deep implant-related sepsis. Further studies should be directed to comparing LON with <b>lengthening</b> and then nailing (LTN) and plate after <b>lengthening</b> (PAL). The potential of <b>lengthening</b> over an antibiotic-coated nail may provide {{a solution to the problem}} of deep IMI.|$|R
5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was <b>lengthened</b> to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} were <b>lengthened</b> at 75th Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard to 660 feet {{to allow}} E and F trains to run eleven car trains. The E and F began running eleven car trains during rush hours on September 8, 1953. The extra train car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were <b>lengthened</b> from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
30|$|The five {{residual}} growth patterns {{described in}} this study were dependent on certain factors that caused acceleration or, on the contrary, a slowdown in the rate of growth—age at the <b>lengthening</b> procedure, the percentage of <b>lengthening</b> and the minimum period between two <b>lengthening</b> procedures. Respecting these criteria produced optimal conditions for excellent residual growth after progressive segmental lower limb <b>lengthening.</b> Respecting these criteria also helped to avoid risks of a slowdown or a complete arrest in growth. If this is the case, however, the paediatric orthopaedic surgeon can propose a planned, multi-step <b>lengthening</b> programme.|$|R
30|$|Both {{implants}} (FITBONE and PRECICE) {{are possible}} options for intramedullary humerus <b>lengthening</b> and have different advantages and disadvantages. Reduced {{range of motion}} in the adjacent joints {{can be a problem}} during the <b>lengthening.</b> Both the entry point for the nail and the <b>lengthening</b> procedure can lead to reduced motion. As there are only few reports on humeral <b>lengthening,</b> we need more data for further evaluation. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, familiar with intramedullary <b>lengthening</b> devices the described techniques might be valuable treatment options in deformity correction of the upper limb.|$|R
30|$|Growth {{inhibition}} {{has been}} reported after tibial <b>lengthening</b> for FH [30]. Sharma et al. [30] concluded that this is related to complete fibular aplasia. Most of the cases presented by Sharma et al. were treated with double-level or combined femur and tibial <b>lengthening</b> without soft tissue release. Hope et al. [31], who used only single-level <b>lengthening,</b> could not demonstrate any growth inhibition. Sabharwal et al. [21] showed that growth inhibition occurred only {{if there had been}} a second tibial <b>lengthening</b> performed within a year of the first <b>lengthening.</b>|$|R
