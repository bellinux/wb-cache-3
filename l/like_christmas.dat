5|$|Angelou {{followed}} her first two installations of her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) and Gather Together in My Name (1974), with Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas,</b> published in 1976. It {{marked the first}} time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography. She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975).|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

Sonic escapes with ease, but S.O.N.I.C.X. repeatedly tries to ruin his reputation. Meanwhile, the animals take on Eggman in his various schemes—including becoming a wrestler and creating a circus—to keep the Emeralds from him. In the final issue, a crossover with {{the continuity of the}} main comic series, that continuity's Metal Sonic appears and allies with Eggman to defeat Sonic, but that continuity's version of Shadow steps in and warps himself and Metal Sonic to another dimension, leading into the events of the first issue of Sonic Universe.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals <b>like</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.|$|E
25|$|Murcia is {{a region}} in the {{south-east}} of Spain which, historically, experienced considerable Moorish colonisation, is similar in many respects to its neighbour, Andalusia. The guitar-accompanied cante jondo Flamenco style is especially associated with Murcia as are rondallas, plucked-string bands. Christian songs, such as the Auroras, are traditionally sung a cappella, sometimes accompanied {{by the sound of}} church bells, and cuadrillas are festive songs primarily played during holidays, <b>like</b> <b>Christmas.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals <b>like</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. The Zagor (nocturnal vigil in Konkani), mainly celebrated in Siolim, in Bardez taluka, is a festival highlighted by dance, drama and music. The Feast of Saint Francis Xavier, {{one of the major}} festivals of the Goan Catholics, is celebrated on 3 December annually to honour the saint's death. Monti or Moti Fest, which commemorates the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is a major festivals celebrated on 8 September, especially in Chinchinim, Goa.

500|$|Lupton {{insists that}} the title, {{one of the many}} similes Angelou used, is tied to the book's themes. Lupton also {{considered}} the title [...] "ironic"; Angelou uses [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and [...] "positive" [...] words—singin' [...] and swingin' —that reflect several meanings related to the text. These words describe the beginnings of Angelou's career as an entertainer, but the irony in the terms also depict the conflict Angelou felt about her son. The words gettin' merry <b>like</b> <b>Christmas</b> are also ironic: [...] "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> was Angelou's most unmerry autobiography". Because music is one of the book's themes, Angelou uses abbreviated verb endings in her title that reflect Black dialect and evoke the sound of a blues singer.|$|E
500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas.</b> As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the contradictions of Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E
500|$|The themes {{encompassing}} African-American writer Maya Angelou's seven autobiographies include racism, identity, family, and travel. Angelou (1928–2014) is {{best known}} for her first autobiography, the critically acclaimed I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). [...] The rest of the books in her series are Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013).|$|E
50|$|New Year {{cards are}} often, however not necessarily, free of Christian and Christmas symbols. Some {{of them are}} abstract, some depict nature or winter symbolics of snow and some are witty.

500|$|In Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Angelou {{continues}} {{an examination}} of her experiences with discrimination, begun in her first two volumes. Critic Selwyn R. Cudjoe refers to [...] "the major problem of her works: {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America". Cudjoe divides Singin' and Swingin' [...] into two parts; in the first part, Angelou works out her relationships with the white world, and in the second part, she evaluates her interactions with fellow Black cast members in Porgy and Bess, as well as her encounters with Europe and Africa.|$|E
500|$|Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> is {{the third}} book of Maya Angelou's seven-volume {{autobiography}} series. Set between 1949 and 1955, the book spans Angelou's early twenties. In this volume, Angelou describes her struggles to support her young son, form meaningful relationships, and forge a successful career in the entertainment world. The work's 1976 publication {{was the first time}} an African-American woman had expanded her life story into a third volume. Scholar Dolly McPherson calls the book [...] "a graphic portrait of the adult self in bloom", while critic Lyman B. Hagen calls it [...] "a journey of discovery and rebirth".|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{subsequently}} wrote six additional autobiographies, {{covering a}} variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, {{and back to the}} US, from the beginnings of World War II to King's assassination. [...] Like Caged Bird, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013, at the age of 85). [...] Critics have often judged Angelou's later autobiographies [...] "in light of the first", and Caged Bird generally receives the highest praise.|$|E
500|$|During 1954 and 1955 Angelou toured 22 countries, {{mostly in}} Europe, with a {{production}} of the opera Porgy and Bess, which she describes in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry <b>Like</b> <b>Christmas</b> (1976). By February 1956 she was touring with her own new show, an exotic calypso act which played at the Keyboard in Beverly Hills, where she was [...] "wooed by disk executives", according to Billboard. She headlined at the Village Vanguard in March, gigged for four weeks at the Clouds in Honolulu in July–August, and joined the Lester Horton dancers for a Halloween show at the Palladium. Angelou signed with Liberty Records in September. By November 1956, Variety was describing the process of recording her first album, Miss Calypso, and even speculating that her second album might be a collection of Noël Coward songs, based on her playful ad-libbing of a Coward tune between takes at the recording studio.|$|E
500|$|According to Angelou, the book's title {{came from}} the rent parties of the 1920s and 1930s, where people would pay the host an {{inexpensive}} entry fee and then eat and drink throughout the weekend. As Angelou stated, people would [...] "sing and swing and get merry <b>like</b> <b>Christmas</b> so one would have some fuel with which to live {{the rest of the}} week". These parties, also called [...] "parlor socials", were attended by members of the working class who were unable to afford to go to Harlem's more expensive clubs. As critic Mary Jane Lupton stated, [...] "The concept of the rent party helps describe Angelou's position...She is a single mother from the South who goes to California and sings and swings for a living. She entertains others for little money as a singer, B-girl, and dancer, without getting very merry at all". Scholar Sondra O'Neale described the phrase as [...] "a folkloric title symbolic of the author's long-deserved ascent to success and fulfillment".|$|E
