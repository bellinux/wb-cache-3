5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} of progress {{is embedded in}} the mediaeval great chain of being, with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in Aristotle's biology, from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in Ramon Lull's <b>Ladder</b> <b>of</b> Ascent and Descent of the Mind, 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.|$|E

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E

Brown again moved up the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat Cheryl Jacques. Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59–41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts Senate. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

5|$|Szabó’s {{next three}} films {{constituted}} {{a new phase}} in his career—moving away from Hungarian productions, in Hungarian, written by Szabó alone, and featuring Bálint, and moving toward international co-productions, in German, written by Szabó in collaboration with others, and featuring Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. The informal trilogy—Mephisto (1981), Colonel Redl (1985) and Hanussen (1988)—features Brandauer {{in a series of}} roles based on historical figures who, as represented in the films, compromised their morals in order to climb the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> success within a context of authoritarian political power. In Mephisto, based on a novel by Klaus Mann, Brandauer plays an actor and theater director in Nazi Germany, a role based on Mann’s former brother-in-law Gustaf Gründgens. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival, and greatly increased Szabó’s international prestige.|$|E

In the 2007–08 season the roar finished in 4th placed in the regular season and 3rd place after the finals series, and in 2008–09 the team finished 3rd on the ladder but again were eliminated in the finals, finishing 3rd. The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last on the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> 10 teams. This would all change a season later, where the Roar would do the double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping the cake with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games. The record was brought to an end by Sydney FC on a wet and windy afternoon in Sydney's west by 2 goals to nil.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

For isotropic spin coupling the entanglement spectrum is, within first order perturbation theory, always {{proportional to the}} energy spectrum of the single chain with a proportionality factor being also independent of S.
