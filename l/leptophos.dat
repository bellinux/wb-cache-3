50|$|<b>Leptophos</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} to be toxic in 1974 {{when more than}} 1000 water buffaloes died after exposure to <b>leptophos</b> in Egypt. In response to this event, the effect of <b>leptophos</b> was investigated on chickens, mice and sheep.|$|E
50|$|When Colombia banned <b>leptophos</b> in 1977, the American company Velsicol {{stopped the}} {{production}} and shipped it's Colombian stocks to El Salvador. No prohibitions exist in El Salvador. In other instances <b>Leptophos</b> was imported to Costa Rica via Mexico and Panama, and until 1981 <b>Leptophos</b> was being sold in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|In Egypt, <b>leptophos</b> used on cotton in 1971 {{caused the}} death of more than 1000 water buffalos {{and a number of}} farmers. The {{compound}} was never registered for domestic use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) but was exported from the U.S. to at least 30 countries. <b>Leptophos</b> was discontinued for use in late 1975 due to its high toxicity. Between 1971 and 1976 the U.S. used $4 million in United States Agency for International Development funds to ship 13.9 million pounds of <b>leptophos</b> and other banned pesticides to 50 countries. In 1975 U.S. companies alone, exported over 3 million pounds of <b>leptophos.</b>|$|E
50|$|Studies {{in plants}} {{indicated}} that <b>leptophos</b> was slowly absorbed following a foliar treatment {{with the major}} quantity found {{to remain on the}} leaf surface. Studies with several leaf types (bean - lettuce) showed that residues diminished rapidly on both types of surfaces. The primary mechanism by which <b>leptophos</b> was lost was presumed to be by volatilization. Qualitatively, <b>leptophos</b> was metabolized to products similar to those found with the mouse. Phenyl phosphonate derivatives were also recovered from plant surfaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leptophos</b> is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of cholinesterases in vitro. The inhibitory {{activity of}} <b>leptophos</b> {{seems to be}} related to hydrophobic interactions involving lipophilic groups as phenyl and 4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenyl and the ability of these groups to donate electrons to firm a complex with the enzyme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leptophos</b> (O-(4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl phenylphosphonothioate) {{belongs to}} the {{organophosphates}} and at room temperature it is a stable white solid. It {{is also known as}} Phosvel, Abar and Vcs 506. <b>Leptophos</b> was primarily used as a pesticide and fungicide. for rice, cotton, fruit and vegetables until its use was discontinued in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Following oral administration, <b>leptophos</b> is {{excreted}} in {{urine and}} faeces as several components. Several components found in urine included: O-methyl phenyl phosphonate (a major component in raturine), O-methyl phenyl phosphonothioic acid (a major component in miceurine), <b>leptophos</b> phenol, and phenyl phosphonic acid. Interspecies differences in metabolism {{can explain the}} difference in major metabolites is mice and rats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leptophos,</b> as well {{as every}} other organophosphate, causes {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibition. Because of this inhibition the following symptoms were observed.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} ways to synthesize <b>leptophos.</b> One {{of the methods}} that is possible for doing that is to let O-methyl phenylthiophosponyl chloride react with 4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenol: ...|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the severe}} {{toxicity}} of <b>leptophos,</b> the lethal doses (LD) are determined in animal tests. Toxicity differs between species and between exposure through the skin, inhalation and the gastrointestinal track (table).|$|E
50|$|When <b>leptophos</b> binds to the AChE, the {{acetylcholine}} {{does not}} get inactivated. This interferes with a normal signal transfer. This means that a nerve signal can't get transmitted {{in the way it}} should be and leads to a broad range of clinical symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The main {{metabolic}} pathway in of <b>leptophos</b> in rats is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the compound. The main Metabolites are phosphonic acid, 4-bromo-2,3-dichlorophenol, O-methyl O-hydrogen phenylphosphonothioate and methyl hydrogen phenylphosphonate. It is unsure {{which of the}} two possible pathways is used to get phosphonic acid.|$|E
50|$|It {{is stable}} at normal temperatures; at 180 degrees Celsius 85 {{percent of the}} {{material}} is decomposed in 5 hours, and at 208 degrees Celsius it decomposes in 2 hours. The main product of thermal decomposition is the S-methyl isomer O-(4-bromo-2,5-chlorophenyl) S-methyl phenylphosphonothioate. <b>Leptophos</b> is hydrolysed slowly under alkaline conditions. The material is stable toward acid.|$|E
50|$|In the laboratory, when {{irradiated}} {{with high}} intensity UV {{light in the}} presence of a strong UV sensitizer, <b>leptophos</b> is rapidly converted first to O-(2,5-dichlorophenyl) O-methylphenyl-phosphonothioate, referred to as the dichloro-photoproduct, and then to a material with the empirical formula C13H10ClO2PS (tentatively identified as 3-chloro-6-methoxydibenz 1,2-oxaphosphorin-6-thione or O-methyl-O,P-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2,6-ylene) phosphonothioate and referred to as the monochloro-photoproduct. UV light increases the rate of hydrolysis under field conditions.|$|E
40|$|The phenylphosphonothioate {{insecticides}} EPN and <b>leptophos,</b> {{and several}} analogs, were evaluated {{with respect to}} their delayed neurotoxic effects in hens and their environmental behavior in a terrestrial-aquatic model ecosystem. Acute toxicity to insects was highly correlated with la of the substituted phenyl group (regression coefficient r =- 0. 91) while acute toxicity to mammals was slightly less well correlated (regression coefficient r =- 0. 71), and neurotoxicity was poorly correlated with la (regression coefficient r =- 0. 35) Both EPN and <b>leptophos</b> were markedly more persistent and bioaccumulative in the model ecosystem than parathion. Desbromoleptophos, a contaminant and metabolite of <b>leptophos,</b> was seen to be a highly stable and persistent terminal residue of <b>leptophos...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to examine the metabolism in vivo of the pesticide <b>leptophos</b> in the rat under normal conditions and during inhibition of the mixed-function oxidases and during depletion of glutathione. Glutathione is a cofactor in the conjugation reactions of the glutathione-S-transferases. Both the mixed-function oxidase system and the glutathione-S-transferases {{have been shown to}} be important in the biotransformation of other organophosphate pesticides. Urinary metabolites of <b>leptophos</b> were extracted, derivatized and subsequently analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The methods used to analyze for alkyl phosphonates were subject to several shortcomings and modifications of the original procedure were necessary. With the modifications the method gave reliable and reproducible results. The results of this study showed that the distribution of <b>leptophos</b> metabolites excreted in the urine of normal rats was methyl phenylthiophosphonate 63 %, methyl phenylphosphonate 23 %, and phenyl phosphonic acid 14 %. These metabolites were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those reported for the mouse. In addition, manipulation of metabolic pathways supported the predictions made as to the nature (i. e., oxidative or conjugative) of the various pathways of <b>leptophos</b> metabolism. The results indicate that demethylation and possibly dearylation of <b>leptophos</b> axon are GSH-dependent reactions and that dearylation of <b>leptophos</b> is an MFO-mediated detoxification pathway...|$|E
40|$|Delayed {{neurotoxicity}} {{induced by}} <b>leptophos,</b> an organophosphorus insecticide, was intensified in hens when phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at dose of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg body weight was administered at different time intervals (24 hr, 3 days, and 5 days) for each dose of PMSF after the hens {{were exposed to}} 30 mg/kg (i. v.) of <b>leptophos.</b> The scores for organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) in all groups treated with 120 mg/kg PMSF {{were significantly higher than}} those in the group treated with <b>leptophos</b> only (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01) and the initial signs of OPIDN appeared 2 or 3 days earlier in the former groups than in the latter group. Further, the greater the PMSF post-treatment dose, the more severe were the signs of OPIDN. These findings indicate that post-treatment with PMSF promotes leptophosinduced OPIDN and reduces the period to OPIDN onset. We also examined the effects of various time intervals between PMSF administration and exposure to <b>leptophos</b> on the development of OPIDN. The OPIDN scores in the two groups of hen treated with PMSF on days 3 and 5 after <b>leptophos</b> exposure were high, especially the score of the 5 days treated group became significantly higher on the 18 th and 19 th day after <b>leptophos</b> administration than even that of the 24 hr treated group with PMSF (P< 0. 05). These findings suggest that variations in both the dose of PMSF and the time intervals of PMSF post-treatment may affect the delayed neurotoxicity induced by <b>leptophos.</b> Moreover, these results also indicate that PMSF should not be used for either the treatment or the prevention of OPIDN...|$|E
40|$|Certain organic {{phosphorus}} esters produce sensorimotor axonopathy in man {{and other}} species. There {{is an excellent}} correlation between the capacity of an organophosphorus compound to produce axonopathy {{and its ability to}} inhibit brain neurotoxic esterase (NTE) in hens. Because NTE is present in peripheral lymphocytes of both hen and man, {{it has been suggested that}} the lymphocyte enzyme might be useful both in experimental and clinical situations as an indicator of exposure to organophosphorus compounds producing axonopathy. Diethyl 4 -nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon), tri- 2 -cresyl phosphate (TOCP), methyl 2, 5 -dichloro- 4 -bromophenyl phenylphosphonothionate (<b>leptophos),</b> and di-n-butyl- 2, 2 -dichlorovinyl phosphate (di-n-butyl dichlorvos, DBDCV) were used to examine the relationship between lymphocyte and brain NTE inhibition in hens. As expected, paraoxon (0. 75 mg/kg) did not inhibit NTE in brain or lymphocytes. TOCP (10 to 100 mg/kg), <b>leptophos</b> (25 to 150 mg/kg), and DBDCV (1. 0 to 4. 0 mg/kg) inhibited both brain and lymphocyte NTE activity in a doserelated manner with good correlation of inhibition between tissues taken 24 hr after exposure (r 2 = 0. 53 to 0. 67; p r 2 = 0. 15 to 0. 30; p < 0. 10 to 0. 05), with consistently less inhibition of lymphocyte NTE relative to brain NTE. This study indicates that assay of lymphocyte NTE can provide a good monitor of exposure to axonotoxic organophosphorus compounds within 24 hr between exposure and measurement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{evaluated}} in vitro {{the potency of}} 23 oximes to reactivate human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibited by racemic leptophos-oxon (O-[4 -bromo- 2, 5 -dichlorophenyl]-O-methyl phenylphosphonate), a toxic metabolite of the pesticide <b>leptophos.</b> Compounds were assayed in concentrations of 10 and 100 µM. In case of leptophos-oxon inhibited AChE, the best reactivation potency was achieved with methoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime and oxime K 027. The most potent reactivators of inhibited BChE were K 033, obidoxime, K 117, bis- 3 -PA, K 075, K 074 and K 127. The reactivation efficacy of tested oximes was lower in case of leptophos-oxon inhibited BChE...|$|E
40|$|Several {{industrial}} and environmental chemicals cause distal and/or central neuropathy among other diverse toxic effects. Spague-Dawley derived rats were fed doses of 2, 5 -hexanedione, acrylamide, tri-o-tolyl phosphate, <b>leptophos</b> and methylmercury via gavage. The dose levels and administration periods {{were established in}} previous experiments designed to assess clinical neuropathy using rats trained to walk on a rotorod apparatus fitted with an electrode floor. After intravenous injections of 3 H-Tryptophan, whole rat brain homogenates were analyzed using liquid scintillation and spectrofluorometric techniques for levels of tryptophan, serotonin and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Serotonin turnover rates were calculated using the specific activities of tryptophan and serotonin at two different time periods. The levels of serotonin {{as well as the}} serotonin turnover rates were unaffected by dosages of 5 to 50 mg acrylamide/kg given daily doses, while whole brain concentrations of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. the rise in 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels coupled with no effects on the other levels in acrylamide and 2, 5 -hexanedione-fed animals suggests a possible inhibition of the energy-dependent 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid efflux system in the brain. Animals given five doses of <b>Leptophos</b> (4. 5 to 45 mg/kg) or six doses from 30 to 300 mg/kg tri-o-tolyl phosphate, administered every third day, showed slightly eleveated, non-significant, serotonin turnover rates while levels of serotonin and tryptophan remained unchanged with a slight decrease in 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels at the highest dosages. Levels of endogenous indole compounds in methylmercury treated rats showed no significant differences from control values; however, the turnover rates and levels of serotonin were slightly lower in the two lower treatment levels, while the highest dose level had no apparent effect on turnover rates or concentrations. Further studies involving longer treatment periods, alternate species or examination of discrete brain areas, may further clarify the effects of these chemicals on brain biochemistry...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried out in Tamil Nadu, India, in 1975 - 76 to {{determine}} the effects of various insecticide treatments applied against the sugar-cane pest Chilo infuscatellus Sn. on predacious arthropods in the crop. Ants were the most abundant predators, while spiders were less numerous and earwigs and coccinellids occurred only in very small numbers. In plots treated with insecticidal sprays, lindane and phosalone caused the greatest reductions in numbers of ants, while more ants were collected from plots treated with <b>leptophos</b> than from untreated ones. Soil applications of lindane and mephosfolan did not appear to have any adverse effects on ants or spiders; fewer ants were collected from plots treated with phosalone granules. Endosulfan did not affect the ant population and appeared to be most suitable for use on sugar-cane since it is known to be effective against other pests of this crop...|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide, 2, 5 -hexanedione, Tri-o-tolyl {{phosphate}} and <b>leptophos</b> {{belong to}} three fundamentally different chemical classes but all four chemicals cause central-peripheral distal axonopathy. Some of these compounds {{have been shown}} to alter brain steady state levels of neurotransmitters or to inhibit the activities of adenosine triphosphatases which are involved in the uptake and storage of biogenic amines. Tests were performed to determine alterations in steady state levels of rat brain norepinephrine and dopamine in response to doses of the above chemicals and of the central nervous system toxin, methyl mercuric chloride sufficient to cause ataxia. Catecholamine synthesis rate constant estimations were performed. Specific activities of tyrosine in brains of control and treatment groups following intravenous injection of labelled tyrosine were compared to determine if passage of tyrosine across the blood-brain barrier were affected by treatments. Levels of the dopamine metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were assayed in all cases. Levels of the norepinephrine metabolite, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxymethylethyleneglycol sulfate, were assayed in response to acrylamide administration. Animal weights were recorded {{at the beginning and end}} of the treatment period. Rats treated with a cumulative dose of 250 mg/kg acrylamide had significantly lower norepinephrine levels than controls. 2, 5 -hexanedione administration significantly increased the dopamine synthesis rate constant at a cumulative dose of 210 mg/kg. Cumulative doses of 700 and 2100 mg/kg also appeared to elevate norepinephrine and dopamine synthesis rate constants, but values were not statistically significant. <b>Leptophos</b> caused a slight but significant increase in dopamine levels in rats administered a cumulative dose of 75 mg/kg. Methyl mercuric chloride caused variable effects to norephinephrine synthesis rate and lowered dopamine synthesis rate constant at cumulative doses of 5 to 50 mg/kg. No other alterations were seen in levels of catecholamines or of their metabolites, nor in synthesis rate constants of the catecholamines in response to administration of the five neurotoxic compounds. No evidence of altered blood-brain transport of tyrosine was observed at any level of neurotoxins administered. Rats given the highest cumulative doses of all neurotoxins except tri-o-tolyl phosphate gained significantly less weight than control animals. It was concluded that the four compounds which cause delayed distal neurotoxicity do not alter levels of turnover rates of brain catecholamines in a consistent manner...|$|E
40|$|Ten day old chick {{sympathetic}} ganglia cultured in a microslide assembly {{were treated}} with a selected group of organophosphate pesticides to evaluate their cytotoxicity ranges, and the usefulness of such a model for screening pesticides. Examination by phase contrast and light microscopy for chemically-induced morphological alteration of nerve fibers, glial cells and neurons provided the criteria for quantitation and assessment of the toxic effects. Concentrations that produced half-maximal effects ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 M (severely toxic) for methylparathian, diazinon, paraoxon, mevinphos, diisopropylfluorophosphate, tri-o-tolyl phosphate and its mixed isomers to a 1 × 10 - 3 M (intermediate) for malathion, <b>leptophos,</b> coumaphos, mono- and dicrotophos. Some or no effects were evident at 1 × 102 -M for O'ethyl-O-p-nitrophenyl phenyl phosphonothioate, tri-m-tolylphosphate, chlorpyriphos and triphenyl phosphate. In all instances, nerve fibers were more sensitive than neurons or glial cells to insecticides. All cellular growth was inhibited at 1 × 10 - 2 M (except triphenyl phosphate). Below 1 x 10 - 7 M, no inhibitory effects were evident. The secondary abnormalities included decreased cellular migration, diffuse cellular growth pattern, increased vacuolization, nerve fiber swelling and cellular degeneration. The cytotoxic effects of these chemicals {{do not appear to}} be related to in vivo toxicity or cholinesterase inhibition potential...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{adequate}} and simple analytical method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography–flame photometric detection (GC–FPD) for {{the determination of}} eleven organophosphorus pesticide residues (i. e., ethoprophos, sulfotep, diazinon, tolclofos-methyl, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, isofenphos, methidathion, ethion, triazophos, <b>leptophos)</b> in vegetables samples (cabbage, kale and mustard) was developed. Important parameters that influence the extraction efficiency (i. e., fibre type, extraction modes, extraction time, salt addition, desorption time and temperature) were systematically investigated. Four types of commercially available fibres (i. e., 50 / 30 μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and 85 μm polyacrylate (PA)) were evaluated. PA fibre exhibited the best performance and {{was used for the}} rest of the studies. The optimised extraction conditions were: extraction time, 30 min at room temperature; stirring speed, 1275 rpm; salt content, 10 % NaCl; desorption time and temperature, 11 min at 260 °C; and no pH adjustment of the sample extract. The method was validated over the range 0. 1 – 100 μg/L. Repeatabilities were satisfactory, ranging between 2. 44 % and 17. 9 % for all analytes. The limits of detection and quantitation ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 14 and 0. 03 to 0. 42 μg/L, respectively. The method was applied to twenty local vegetable (cabbage, kale and mustard) products. Chlorpyrifos (0. 22 – 1. 68 μg/kg) was the most detected pesticide in the tested samples. The obtained values are however lower than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) as stipulated in the Food Act & Regulations of Malaysia...|$|E
