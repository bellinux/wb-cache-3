500|$|In the {{following}} scene Agnes {{has been moved}} by the Prefect's grief, and prayed for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done. The repentant Procopius kneels before her, while she <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to tell him Vade amplius noli peccare ("Go forth and sin no more"; from [...] ). However {{the result of the}} miracle was that (in William Caxton's translation) [...] "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits". The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from [...] Nihil invenio cause in eam ("I find no cause against her") above. The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear. Her last words, from , are In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam ("Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} way to show a person going through a private hell. That everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut. The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E
2500|$|She {{asks him}} for a kiss to [...] "comfort me" [...] and when he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her she pulls him from the saddle and drowns him. She swims to the shore and thanks God that [...] "The dangers she o'ercame".|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and caught}} his hand; her touch was fiery hot.|$|R
60|$|Fra Girolamo <b>leaned</b> <b>down.</b> But {{no other}} word came for some moments.|$|R
60|$|Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to {{me until}} her splendid eyes looked {{straight}} into my dazzled ones.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{there is}} nothing more lovely than the love of two {{beautiful}} women, who are not envious of each other's charms. How delightfully they impart to each other the pattern of a cap, or flounce, or frill! how charmingly they entrust some slight, slender secret about tinting a flower or netting a purse! Now one leans over the other, and guides her inexperienced hand, as it moves in the mysteries of some novel work, and then the other looks up with an eye beaming with devotion; and then again the first <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> a little lower, and gently presses her aromatic lips upon her friend's polished forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "A blunder, believe me, Immelan," [...] he {{continued}} thoughtfully. [...] "Death will not lower over my path till my task is accomplished. I am young--many {{years younger than}} you, Immelan--and the greatest physicians marvel at my strength. Against the assassin's knife or bullet I am secure. You have been brought up and lived, my terrified friend, {{in a country where}} religion remains a shell and a husk, without comfort to any man. It is not so with me, I live in the spirit as in the body, and my days will last until the sun <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> and lights me to the world where those dwell who have fulfilled their destiny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] she said, [...] "it's a palace, {{with the}} ash-trunks smooth like a girl's arm, and the elm-columns, ribbed and bossed and fretted, {{with the great}} steel shafts of beech, all rising up to hold an {{embroidered}} care-cloth over us; and every thread of the care-cloth vibrates with music for us, and the little broidered birds sing; and the hazel-bushes fling green spray round us, and the honeysuckle <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to pour out scent over us. Look at the harvest of bluebells—ripened for us! Listen to the bee, sounding among all the organ-play—if he sounded exultant for us!" [...] She looked at him, with tears coming up into her eyes, and a little, winsome, wistful smile hovering round her mouth. He was very pale, and dared not look at her. She put her hand in his, leaning softly against him. He watched, as if fascinated, a young thrush with full pale breast who hopped near to look at them—glancing with quick, shining eyes.|$|E
60|$|The disheveled maid was no {{polished}} {{mistress of}} ceremonies. She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{into the void}} and hailed Aline.|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} shiver. Groves <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and tried to}} peer through the keyhole. He {{rose to his feet}} hastily.|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and picked}} up a sea-fishing rod. Jacob was terrified as he saw her swaying {{backwards}} and forwards.|$|R

5000|$|She {{asks him}} for a kiss to [...] "comfort me" [...] and when he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her she pulls him from the saddle and drowns him. She swims to the shore and thanks God that [...] "The dangers she o'ercame".|$|E
50|$|Tristram, who in {{this piece}} married Isolt of the White Hands, carries his {{winnings}} instead to Mark's wife Queen Isolt, who is upset that Tristram married another woman. The two mock {{each other for a}} brief period before Tristram at last puts the necklace about Isolt's neck, and <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her.|$|E
60|$|Jo <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to {{kiss the}} {{tranquil}} face, and with that silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.|$|R
6000|$|Nehushta {{stayed to}} help Anna to her feet. When she judged her {{mistress}} {{to be out}} of hearing she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and whispered: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded back. In a few moments the Doctor reappeared. He <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and whispered to the Captain.|$|R
50|$|Dying {{of colon}} cancer in a {{hospital}} bed, William Andrews' wife <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to him and sees {{a smile on his}} face, which she wrongly perceives as being for her. In fact, he is merely ecstatic at the sensation of leaving his body, and therefore all of his pain, behind. At the centre of his vision he sees a pinprick of white light which steadily expands.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Happy Birthday", Natalia shows {{confidence}} while {{investigating the}} case and a true {{member of the team}} when Horatio uses physical force to interrogate a suspect. Though not quite comfortable with the situation, she entered the Hummer instead of leaving when Horatio gave her an out; looking out for bystanders when the suspect cries out when Horatio <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> on his dislocated shoulder.|$|E
50|$|The {{main idea}} of the video {{consists}} of showing several paradoxes by images. Some scenes of the clip are feature women wearing elegant dresses and athletic shoes while they compete at an all-weather running track. A distinct man wearing a suit is then shown while he crosses the road carrying a surfboard, while a female swimmer which looks ready to dive is later filmed while she <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> from a roof instead of a trampoline.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> and Hal {{held up his}} hand. The new-comer {{grasped the}} youth's wrist, {{and in a moment}} Hal was upon the cellar floor.|$|R
60|$|Capper {{had taken}} Greensheve's {{position}} on the cope, and now he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> his hand, and, first one and then the other, pulled them up.|$|R
60|$|Mamma <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and whispered}} one {{word to the}} older girls; and {{suddenly}} they all took hands to dance round Effie, singing as they skipped.|$|R
50|$|Agon {{begins to}} slowly {{make its way}} through a steel {{manufacturing}} plant, but before it reaches the furnaces, the helicopter manages to arrive and begins to circle it. The monster quickly turns toward the uranium being suspended overhead and begins to follow the helicopter as it is led away from the plant and back towards the ocean. Agon <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> and drops the boat from its mouth as it begins to pursue after its food, freeing Monta from its grasp. Goro and the others quickly rush to him and find him unconscious, but otherwise uninjured.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Butlin {{wrote that}} this colour print {{is one of}} the most {{inspired}} of all 'literal' illustrations of a text in the history of art. In fact, [...] "pity and air", two words of the Shakespeare's verses, are also two motifs used by Blake in this picture: a female cherub <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to snatch the baby from its mother. According to Blake biographer Alexander Gilchrist, the print [...] "is on a tolerably large scale, a woman bending down to succour a man stretched out at length, as if given over to death." ...|$|E
50|$|On Liberation Day, the Jackal, {{disguised}} as an elderly veteran amputee, enters the building {{he had chosen}} earlier. He assembles his rifle, hidden disassembled {{in one of his}} crutches, and waits at a window in an upper apartment. When Lebel finds out a policeman allowed a man to pass through the cordon, the two race to the building. As de Gaulle presents the first medal, the Jackal shoots, but misses when the tall president suddenly <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss the recipient on the cheek. Lebel and the policeman burst in. The Jackal shoots the policeman, but Lebel kills him. The Jackal, never fully identified, is later buried in an unmarked grave.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} her mother wished to speak, and <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> over her, for Madame Duchesne could not as yet raise her voice above a whisper.|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the second day, Miss Frost got her hand from under the bedclothes, and laid it on Alvina's hand. Alvina <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You very, very foolish Englishwoman," [...] she said. [...] "A hand <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> from Heaven, and {{you liked}} better {{to stay where}} you were, but I am glad." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the others}} {{sit at the}} table, tucking into their food without a second thought, Sir Gawain stands {{on the floor of}} the hall, waiting courteously to be invited to the meal. The giant asks him to go over to the buttery door, to select a spear and throw it at his face. Sir Gawain {{complies}} and, as the giant <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> towards the knight invitingly, Sir Gawain casts the spear. It clatters against the wall behind the Carle, sending sparks ‘as though from a flint’. Whether it has passed straight through the Carle’s head or whether Sir Gawain has (uncharacteristically) missed, the listener is not told; although in the 17th-century version, the Carle ducks.|$|E
50|$|The Deputy is then {{seen in a}} {{hotel room}} reading {{newspaper}} articles on a computer, when he stumbles across one which shows Courtney and Clint on their wedding day. Suddenly, articles about the murder in the church flood the screen, before Bughuul's symbol and a loud buzzing appear and the screen cuts out. When he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to collect his bag, the reflection of the screen shows Bughuul standing in the bathroom doorway behind the Deputy. When the Deputy sees it and looks behind him, there is nothing there. Bughuul then appears in the reflection again, before walking forward and putting his finger to his lips. The Deputy slams the laptop screen closed.|$|E
50|$|The story {{then returns}} to Mears and Petrie {{at the church}} in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that {{they are on the}} run from the {{surviving}} vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him as he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart. Filled with grief, he and Petrie leave, knowing that vampires will forever hunt them.|$|E
60|$|He {{ran back}} and speedily brought up Phil's pole, and around it he wound the line, to {{strengthen}} it {{and hold the}} joints together. Then he <b>leaned</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rochester signalled {{with his}} whip to Saton {{to wait for}} a moment. As soon as the other two were out of earshot, he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> from his saddle.|$|R
