5000|$|Some {{brands of}} soy sauce {{are made from}} acid-hydrolyzed soy protein instead of brewed with a {{traditional}} culture. This takes about three days. Although {{they have a different}} flavor, aroma, and texture when compared to brewed soy sauces, they have a longer shelf life and are usually made for this reason. The clear plastic packets of dark sauce common with Chinese-style take-out food typically use a hydrolyzed vegetable protein formula. Some higher-quality hydrolyzed vegetable protein products with no added salt, sugar or colorings are sold as <b>low-sodium</b> <b>soy</b> <b>sauce</b> alternatives called [...] "liquid aminos" [...] in health food stores, similar to the way salt substitutes are used. These products are, however, not necessarily low in sodium.|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, {{randomized}} placebo-controlled {{study was}} conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the long-term use of <b>low-sodium</b> <b>soy</b> <b>sauce</b> and miso in the general Japanese population and its effect on blood pressure (BP). Forty men and 24 women were randomly allocated to a low-sodium group (n= 32) or a control group (n= 32). <b>Low-sodium</b> <b>soy</b> <b>sauce</b> and miso, which were approximately 25 % and 20 % lower in salt content than common soy sauce and miso, were used in the study. The change in BP after a 6 -week intervention was evaluated. There {{were no significant differences in}} age, sex, body mass index, BP or hypertension between the 2 groups before intervention. After the 6 -week intervention, no significant change in BP was observed in the entire cohort. However, in those aged 40 years and older, 6. 4 mmHg net reduction in diastolic BP with no significant change in systolic BP was noted in the low-sodium group. Taste evaluation for the low-sodium seasoning was considerably good. Replacing soy sauce and miso of the common type with the low-sodium alternative is feasible in the general population and could be the basis for a salt reduction strategy in the Japanese diet. rights:社団法人日本循環器学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf:[URL]...|$|E
