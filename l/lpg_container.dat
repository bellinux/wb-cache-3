The container is suited for automotive use and has a so-called "UFO" shape, which enables the container {{to be placed in}} the spare wheel compartment. The weight reduction is about 80 % compared to a steel <b>LPG</b> <b>container</b> which results in better car handling, lower fuel consumption, lower road taxes (in the Netherlands) and easier installation. The container offers a volume of 56 litres in combination with a total weight of only eight kilograms and a cost price close to a steel container. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{gasification}} of lignocellulosic {{waste was}} conducted by fermentation method at thermophilic condition (45 - 55 °C). The material was obtained from vegetable market at Bogor. The gasification trial made in pilot scale reactor of having capacity of 30 m 3 and equipped with gas holder of 50 m 3, steam boiler of 50 kg/h and dual generator of 17. 5 kVA. The waste was cut first become 1 - 3 cm long on choper of 0. 3 m 3 /h volume. Parameter of fermentation choosed on 10 m 3 volume actif and retention time was 20. 9 daysThe result revealed that thermophilic fermentation of waste which had total solid about 22. 3 % and ash about 33. 9 % and feeding about 478 kg fresh waste per day produced biogas about 28. 7 m 3 per day on methane content about 54. 5 %, productivity about 2. 9 m 3 per m 3 reactor per day and efficiency of conversion about 57 %. The total of fuel consumption along fermentation per day was 4. 34 hours of man hours work about 1. 16 MJ and it was from 1 tube LPG of 12. 5 kg and 14. 31 diesel. LPG was used for steam boiler can be changed with 31. 2 m 3 biogas per day. In this case the production of biogas per day cannot be dropped for the total of fuel consumption even steam boiler. The fermentation of 22965 kg wet lignocellulosic waste produced gas bio about 1380 m 3 and wet residu for compos raw material about 16430 kg. The biogas production was equavalent with 44 <b>LPG</b> <b>container</b> of 12. 5 kg...|$|E

50|$|One remedy, that is {{utilized}} in industrial settings, is to equip such containers with {{a measure to}} provide a fire-resistance rating. Large, spherical <b>LPG</b> <b>containers</b> may have up to a 15 cm steel wall thickness. They are equipped with an approved pressure relief valve. A large fire {{in the vicinity of}} the vessel will increase its temperature and pressure, following the basic gas laws. The relief valve on the top is designed to vent off excess pressure in order to prevent the rupture of the container itself. Given a fire of sufficient duration and intensity, the pressure being generated by the boiling and expanding gas can exceed the ability of the valve to vent the excess. If that occurs, an overexposed container may rupture violently, launching pieces at high velocity, while the released products can ignite as well, potentially causing catastrophic damage to anything nearby, including other containers.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} winding machines {{have two}} axes of motion, the mandrel rotation and the carriage travel (usually horizontal). Two axes machines are {{best suited to}} the manufacture of pipes only. For pressure vessels such as <b>LPG</b> or CNG <b>containers</b> (for example) it is normal to have a four axis winding machine. A four axes machine additionally has a radial (cross-feed) axis perpendicular to carriage travel and a rotating fibre payout head mounted to the cross-feed axis. The payout head rotation {{can be used to}} stop the fibre band twisting and thus varying in width during winding.|$|R
