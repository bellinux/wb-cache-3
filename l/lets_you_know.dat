500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> something bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E
500|$|Complaints {{about her}} role as fashion {{eminence}} grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. [...] "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no," [...] according to Karl Lagerfeld. [...] "She's not too pushy", agrees François-Henri Pinault, {{chief executive officer of}} PPR, Gucci's parent company. [...] "She <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." [...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. [...] "Commercial is not a dirty word to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> when you have an opening and when to run".|$|E

500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} André 3000's {{performance and}} the song itself, writing: [...] "André 3000 is sharp and effortlessly charismatic on his rapped verse, but the real attraction here is the track itself." [...] Similarly, David Amidon of PopMatters commented that the song features [...] "one of those rare 'look how effortless rapping is for me'." [...] This was echoed by Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media, who wrote that [...] " [...] carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including 'Party', which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, [...] while its bounce provides prime summer barbecue background." [...] Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was also positive: [...] "'Party' sounds right out of The SOS Band's catalog (its plodding tempo {{is the only thing}} that <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> she isn't quoting a particularly poetic, desperately meth-seeking craigslist m4m ad [...] )". Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that Beyoncé sings the song [...] "in her best impression of naughtiness." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the minimal production and simplistic lyrics of [...] "Party" [...] further describing the song as being as [...] "simple as a Beyoncé song gets: a low-key, synth-y beat paired with inspired vocals by Beyoncé and a killer, fluid verse by Mr. Benjamin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In the United States, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] became Madonna's second number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The song debuted on {{the chart}} at number 55 on the issue dated March 2, 1985. After six weeks, the song {{reached the top of}} the chart, {{replacing}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] by USA for Africa. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was the second number-one song for Bettis as a songwriter, after [...] "Top of the World" [...] by The Carpenters (1973). With [...] "Crazy for You", Bettis was in doubt whether the song would reach the top, after it was stuck at number two for three weeks, behind [...] "We Are the World". Both he and Lind commented, [...] "If you gotta lose to something, it might as well be 'We Are the World'. Luckily enough, the final week of the upsurge of the record, we topped 'We Are the World', which <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how hot the song and how hot the artist [...] was." [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 16, 1985, for shipment of one million copies of the single across United States—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. The song reached number two on the Adult Contemporary Singles (behind [...] "Rhythm of the Night" [...] by DeBarge), and 80 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It placed at nine on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. In Canada, the song debuted at number 70 on the RPM issue dated March 16, 1985. On its eleventh week {{on the chart}}, the song reached the top position. It was present on the chart for a total of 25 weeks and was ranked seventh on the RPM Year-end chart for 1985. A music video was released, featuring Madonna singing the song in a night-club. The video was included in , released in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Discouraged, Miller {{returned}} to New York. He {{realized that he}} needed to develop a unique sound, and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonized within a single octave. George T. Simon discovered a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz for Glenn Miller. Miller hired Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. According to Simon, [...] "Willie's tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound." [...] With this new sound combination, Glenn Miller found a way to differentiate his band's style from the many bands that existed in the late thirties. Miller talked about his style in the May 1939 issue of Metronome magazine. [...] "You'll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal ... We're fortunate in that our style doesn't limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing clarinet most of the time, <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> whose band you're listening to. And that's about all there is to it." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{the world}} of {{literature}} Arnold has occupied for many years an authoritative position as critic and teacher, similar to that held by Ruskin in {{the world of}} art. In his literary work two very different moods are manifest. In his poetry he reflects the doubt of an age which witnessed the conflict between science and revealed religion. Apparently he never passed through any such decisive personal struggle as is recorded in Sartor Resartus, and he has no positive conviction such as is voiced in [...] "The Everlasting Yea." [...] He is beset by doubts which he never settles, and his poems generally express sorrow or regret or resignation. In his prose he shows the cavalier spirit,--aggressive, light-hearted, self-confident. Like Carlyle, he dislikes shams, and protests against what he calls the barbarisms of society; but he writes with a light touch, using satire and banter as the better part of his argument. Carlyle denounces with the zeal of a Hebrew prophet, and <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that you are hopelessly lost if you reject his message. Arnold is more like the cultivated Greek; his voice is soft, his speech suave, but he leaves the impression, if you happen to differ with him, that you must be deficient in culture. Both these men, so different in spirit and methods, confronted the same problems, sought the same ends, and were dominated by the same moral sincerity.|$|E

60|$|The {{house of}} Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied, with four carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You may {{recognize}} it by five red hand-prints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass the grocer {{and a man}} who says he gets his living by seal-cutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives, servants, friends, and retainers. The two upper rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was stolen from an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by a soldier. To-day, only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally, except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go to Peshawar in the cold, weather to visit his son who sells curiosities near the Edwardes' Gate, and then he slept under a real mud roof. Suddhoo is a great friend of mine, because his cousin had a son who secured, thanks to my recommendation, the post of head-messenger to a big firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God will make me a Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I dare say his prophecy will come true. He is very, very old, with white hair and no teeth worth showing, and he has outlived his wits--outlived nearly everything except his fondness for his son at Peshawar. Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris, Ladies of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable profession; but Azizun has since married a medical student from the Northwest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near Bareilly. Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He is very rich. The man who is supposed to get his living by seal-cutting pretends to be very poor.
