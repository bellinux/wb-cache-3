30|$|Our {{experience}} {{indicates that}} we should pay attention to airway obstruction due to lodging of the polyp between the vocal cords after LMA insertion in patients with a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp.</b>|$|E
30|$|A 62 -year-old male {{underwent}} elective surgical resection {{of a large}} <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp.</b> The polyp {{was attached}} to the right vocal fold and synchronously swung inward into the trachea and outward to the larynx with inspiration and expiration, respectively. Although manual positive pressure ventilation was easily achieved without any airway obstruction after anesthetic induction, the airway was completely obstructed by the polyp lodged between the vocal cords immediately after LMA insertion. Soon after removal of the LMA, patency of the airway was dramatically improved.|$|E
40|$|Sections of hyalinized <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyps</b> {{stained with}} {{haematoxylin}} and eosin or Congo red {{can easily be}} confused with localized amyloid of the larynx. Several histological methods were applied to 61 specimens containing hyaline deposits or hyalinized tissues which included 36 <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyps.</b> The results were compared with seven cases of localized amyloidosis of the upper respiratory tract and four cases of secondary amyloidosis...|$|R

40|$|Benign <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyps</b> {{and normal}} larynxes {{have been studied}} by histochemical and other {{staining}} methods. These show that the polyps contain much free hyaluronic acid and 6 -chondroitin sulphate. Their mode of production may be the mechanical separation of these compounds from collagen fibres by vibration. An alcian-elastic stain may be a helpful diagnostic method...|$|R
30|$|LMA {{insertion}} enables successful ventilation in {{a patient}} with airway obstruction due to several large laryngeal polyps [5]. Thus, {{the use of an}} LMA contributes to the relief of airway obstruction in some patients with a large <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp.</b> However, LMA insertion also has a potential risk of exacerbating airway obstruction in such patients as shown in our case. Thus, when laryngoscopic surgery with a flexible laryngoscope through an LMA is planned in patients with laryngeal lesions, preparation should also be made for transcricoid jet ventilation and tracheostomy prior to surgery.|$|E
30|$|Airway {{management}} for laryngoscopic surgery {{in patients with}} a laryngeal tumor includes temporary tracheostomy, endotracheal intubation using a thin ETT, transglottic or intercricoid high-frequency jet ventilation, and LMA insertion [1, 3]. However, {{it has been reported}} that the polyp was dislodged by the ETT and airway obstruction occurred when the trachea was intubated [4]. When high-frequency jet ventilation is performed, there are risks of complications such as subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax [3]. An LMA has been used for airway protection, and introduction of a flexible laryngoscope via the LMA has been successfully used in patients with a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp</b> [1, 5]. Thus, we considered that LMA insertion could avoid invasive tracheostomy and would allow surgery to be performed using a flexible bronchoscope.|$|E
30|$|Surgery and {{anesthetic}} {{management of}} patients with a laryngeal tumor occupying {{the space of the}} glottis is challenging for anesthesiologists because airway obstruction can occur during surgery. Temporary tracheostomy, endotracheal intubation using a thin endotracheal tube (ETT), and high-frequency jet ventilation have been used for airway management for laryngoscopic surgery with a rigid laryngoscope in such patients [1]. Another option is a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), which has been used for airway protection, and introduction of a flexible laryngoscope for surgery has been successfully used in such patients [2]. There has been no report of LMA insertion itself exacerbating airway obstruction in such patients. Here, we report a patient with a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp</b> in whom manual positive pressure ventilation was easily achieved after anesthetic induction, but the airway was completely obstructed by the polyp lodged between the vocal cords following LMA insertion.|$|E
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyps,</b> four with Reinke’s edema, three with leukoplakia, one with papilloma {{and one with}} malignant tumor were studied by means of laryngeal contact endoscopy during microlaryngoscopy. This technique allowed in vivo and in situ visualization of the superficial layer of the laryngeal epithelium after staining with methylene blue. Cell structures evaluated were the size and color of the nuclei, the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, nuclear and cytoplasmic contours, the presence of nucleoli, mitoses and keratoses, {{as well as the}} microvascular network of the mucosa and superficial cellular changes from normal to pathological. The normal squamous epithelium of the vocal cord showed a homogeneous cellular population with regular nuclear and cytoplasmic morphological characteristics and a uniform nucleus-to-cytolasm ratio. Specific cellular epithelial pat- terns and several alterations of the vascular distribution were found in different pathological conditions. Cytological pictures obtained at contact endoscopy were consistent with histological findings in all the patients studie...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{endoscopy}} is {{a technique}} to analyse the upper G-I functioning under physiological conditions. Physiological conditions are those of daily life, i. e. walking, sitting, sleeping or eating, drinking and belching. Only in this way {{we are able to}} understand what happens during 24 h. This includes longitudinal observation over a 24 hr period. Observation in combination with measurement techniques like pH-metry, impedancemetry, manometry enables us to see and to measure. In this way an accurate interpretation of our results becomes possible. The aim is to get {{a better understanding of the}} physiology and pathophysiology of the upper G-I tract, particularly of digestion and reflux. The result was the identification of three different reflux-mechanisms : — Reflux-oesophagitis is caused predominantly by saliva-acid-bile-compound or saliva-acid-pancreatic-juice-compound. The local effect over time is proven. The presence of the compound is always combined with globus and burning sensation; — The important mechanism for the extra-oesophageal complications is gas reflux (EsoPharyngeal-Reflux-Disease – EPRD). The gas model explains the great variety of the different diseases such as e. g. asthma, chronic laryngitis, <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyps</b> and granulomas, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, recurrent otitis media and hyperplastic tonsils in infants etc. — The oesophagus acts as a filter system e. g. for the gas particles of the refluxedmaterial to prevent extra-oesophageal complications. This system is based on 3 different filtration mechanisms : the labyrinth effect, the undulation and the pressure change. This illustrates that apart from the peristaltic activity, one important mechanismof the oesophagus is the protection of the pharyngo-larynx against reflux...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years or so {{radiology}} has shown dramatic technological developments especially in cross sectional imaging and the investigation and management of the complex ENT patient has benefitted enormously. Plain radiographs are being utilised less and less as their limitations are becoming more apparent and various studies have shown for example a 75 % discrepancy between plain sinus radiographs and coronal sinus CT in children 1, 2. The incorporation of small and flexible ultrasound transducers with high-resolution imaging into the tips of endoluminal catheters has allowed good quality endoluminal ultrasound. Recently endolaryngeal ultrasound has been clinically evaluated in 38 patients with a variety of laryngeal pathology including vocal fold <b>polyps,</b> <b>laryngeal</b> cysts, chronic laryngitis, epithelial dysplasia and cancer 5. Using this technique tumour size and infiltration could be measured and involvement of the thyroid cartilage or anterior commissure could be visualised. Not surprisingly it was not able to detect any specific changes in the sonographic picture of patients suffering from chronic laryngitis, epithelial dysplasia or microinvasive cancer. Although these results are encouraging, its relative lack of availability will result in it only having a limited role in evaluating laryngeal pathology...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the pathological and clinical {{results of the}} 126 patients who had endoscopic direct laryngoscopy for laryngeal pathology. Material nd Method: In this study, endoscopic direct laryngoscopy were applied to 126 laryngeal pathology patients between March 2007 and June 2010. The pathological results were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The age of the patients range from 21 to 63 (mean: 40, 2 years), including 39 women (% 30, 9), and 87 men (% 69, 1). The pathological results of the 126 patients were; <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp</b> in 87 patients, laryngeal nodule in 27 patients, squamouse cell carcinoma in 12 patients, entubation granuloma in 2 patients and laryngeal tuberculosis 1 patient. Discussion: Direct laryngoscopy using the operating microscope (microlaryngoscopy) that is a surgical method&nbsp; provides a clear observation of the laryngeal pathologies and allows fine surgery to the larynx...|$|E
30|$|However, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that LMA insertion itself can cause deformity of the vocal cords [2], possibly resulting in airway obstruction due to lodging of the polyp between the vocal cords as in our case. LMA insertion may thus exacerbate airway obstruction in patients with a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp</b> in the glottis, and caution should be paid for LMA insertion in such patients. In our case, the polyp was smoothly swung inward into the trachea in inspiration and swung outward to the larynx in expiration through the vocal cords during spontaneous respiration without dyspnea. Accordingly, reduction of the volume of the polyp by using a flexible laryngoscope under mask ventilation with light sedation might have been another option. However, this procedure may also have the risk of unanticipated difficult airway due to accidental deep sedation, bleeding from the tumor and abrupt body movement caused by surgical intervention.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Artemin (ARTN) {{has been}} implicated in the {{development}} and progression of several human malignancies. However, the clinical and prognostic significance of ARTN and its receptors has not yet been investigated in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Therefore, in the present study, the protein expression of ARTN and its receptor, namely GFRα 1, was determined in 76 LSCC and 26 <b>laryngeal</b> <b>polyp</b> tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of ARTN and GFRα 1 expression was analyzed in patients with LSCC. The results revealed that the expression of ARTN and GFRα 1 was significantly increased in LSCC compared with polyp tissue samples. Furthermore, the expression of ARTN and GFRα 1 was positively associated with pTNM stage in LSCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed a strong association between the expression of ARTN or GFRα 1 and the survival of patients with LSCC. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the expression of ARTN was significantly correlated with the expression GFRα 1. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that ARTN and GFRα 1 may be useful predictors of disease progression and outcome in patients with LSCC...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveAnesthesia {{of patient}} for direct {{laryngoscopy}} (DL) and microlaryngosurgery (MLS) was technically challenging. The anesthetist had usually {{concern about the}} loss of spontaneous ventilation and occurrence of obstruction after induction with IV drugs. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare between flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope and direct rigid laryngoscope during awake intubation in patients with laryngeal mass scheduled for direct laryngoscopic surgery (DL) and microlaryngosurgery (MLS). It was a study to assess the best way for intubation with the least side effects, discomfort to the patients and high success rate of intubation. MethodsFourty adult patients Malampati 1, 2 and ASA I,II,III with small <b>laryngeal</b> mass or <b>polyp</b> scheduled for direct laryngoscope (DL) and microlaryngoscopic surgery. They were randomly computerized divided into two groups 20 patients in each group; Group FO; intubation with flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope. Group RL; intubation with rigid laryngoscope. ResultsThe time of intubation was statistically significantly higher in fibro-optic group (group FO) (92 ± 34 s) than rigid laryngoscope group (group RL) (35 ± 5 s). There were two patients in group RL needed 2 nd intubation attempt for better visualization of the view but there were six patients in group FO needed 2 nd intubation attempt for suction of secretion and blood. According to modified six point scale the patients ranged between 1 and 3 in group FO while they range between 2 and 4 in group RL. ConclusionThe study suggested that the flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope was very comfortable to the patients and less traumatic with less cardiovascular stress but it took longer time and had a higher incidence of 2 nd attempt and failure rate. Accordingly, it recommend the use of flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope in expected small size and non-bloody mass with prepared rigid laryngoscope and tube with stylet to be ready to use if needed...|$|R
