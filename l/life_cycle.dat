5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their <b>life</b> <b>cycle,</b> extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} <b>life</b> <b>cycle,</b> and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{research}} productivity of German academic economists over their <b>life</b> <b>cycles.</b> It {{turns out that}} the career patterns of research productivity as measured by journal publications are characterized by marked cohort effects. Moreover, the <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> of younger German economists are hump shaped and resemble the <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> identified for US economists, whereas the <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> of older German economists are much flatter. Finally, we find that not only productivity, but also research quality follows distinct <b>life</b> <b>cycles.</b> Our study employs econometric techniques that are likely to produce estimates that are more trustworthy than previous estimates.

5|$|Although a large {{majority}} of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus species (such as Bombus atratus) will spend part of their <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

Too often it is found that these theories are elegant in isolation, but provide little help in focusing a company's efforts. Consumer behaviour has been researched for many decades, as has product <b>life</b> <b>cycles,</b> but the link between consumer buying behaviour and economic <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> of products is mystical, with most chief executive officers (CEOs) believing it occurs like magic.

40|$|A {{study on}} the effect of length time shading (approx 70 % of sun rise intensity) to the growth and yield of Camar mung bean variety was {{conducted}} in Nogotirto, Gamping, Yogyakarta. The experiment was arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design with 3 replications. The treatment were 6 levels of length and time of shading of Camar mung bean variety, i. e. : shading at the whole <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (A), the first half <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (B), the second half <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (C), the first quarter <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (D), the second quarter <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> (E) and no shading at the whole <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> or control (F). The result showed that the length and time of shading affected the growth and yield of Camar mung bean variety significantly except for the number of root - pimples, the number of effective root - pimples and weight of 100 grain per plant parameters. In accordance with the control, the shading at the first quarter and second quarter or at last <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> gave no significant different in the growth and yield.

50|$|Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) {{used for}} the {{description}} of <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.

These complex <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> have received increasing scientific attention {{over the past}} few decades, due to their usefulness for both ecological and evolutionary studies. I present a synthesis of our current knowledge of the ecological functioning and evolutionary implications of the isomorphic, biphasic <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> commonly found in many species of marine algae. There are both costs and benefits to <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> with 2 morphologically similar but separate, free-living phases that differ in ploidy levels (haploids and diploids). Evolutionary theory predicts that the existence of subtle yet important differences between the phases may be what allows these <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> to be maintained. Different phases of the same species can vary in abundance, in demographic parameters such as mortality and fecundity, in their physiology, and in their resistance to herbivory. Some taxonomic groups within the red algae have received significant attention toward these issues, while our knowledge of these properties for brown and green algae remains limited...|$|R
