5|$|After the Bergen Line was electrified, {{the work}} {{continued}} on the Dovre <b>Line.</b> <b>The</b> section from Hamar to Otta was finished in 1967, {{and the following}} year to Dombås. This allowed the locomotives {{to be transferred to}} secondary lines. With the final delivery of the last units in 1969 and the completion of the electrification of the Dovre Line in 1970, the final steam locomotive was taken out of service. During {{the last half of the}} 1960s, the Di 3 was put into service on the Rauma <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Røros <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Solør <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Valdres Line and the Meråker Line.|$|E
5|$|A few special {{passenger}} services were subsequently operated, notably in 1969, 1983 and 1992/93. In 1993, Octel's daily freight traffic {{was transferred to}} road haulage, for safety reasons, and traffic thus ceased on the <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> Octel plant closed in 2003, and has since been demolished.|$|E
5|$|A fully {{electrified}} and double-tracked <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Trans-Siberian Railway line {{is capable}} of transporting around 100 million tons of freight annually. The line can handle up to 200,000 TEU of containerized international transit freight per year.|$|E
50|$|The song's lyrical {{structure}} is irregular. While many songs {{have the same}} number of <b>lines</b> for <b>the</b> verse or chorus, the first verse has eight <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> second verse has six <b>lines,</b> and <b>the</b> last verse has two <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> song's first chorus has two <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> second chorus has three, and the third chorus has twelve lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{three groups}} of <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Lines,</b> <b>the</b> Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Lines,</b> can be further grouped into two, <b>the</b> Kobe-Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Lines</b> from a {{historical}} reason. Hankyu has two groups of rolling stock, one for <b>the</b> Kobe-Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and <b>the</b> other for <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Lines.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division {{was moved}} to defend the Naktong River <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> division, which was untried in combat, was struck with a strong attack by several {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half, and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, promoting a fight there.|$|E

Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line.
