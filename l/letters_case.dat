40|$|Objective: The key to {{successful}} {{management of the}} rudimentary uterine horn is early detection. This {{review of the literature}} seeks to illustrate important aspects of diagnosis and management of this anomaly. Data sources: An English language MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2003 was performed, using the search terms "rudimentary uterine horn," "accessory horn," "uterus bicornis unicollis," "hematometra," "unicornuate or bicornuate uterus," and "mullerian anomaly. " References from previously published sources were also obtained. Methods of study selections: One hundred thirty <b>letters,</b> <b>case</b> reports, case series, and review articles featuring rudimentary uterine horn were found. Reports before 1966 were excluded because outcomes before the advent of modern diagnostic techniques were not relevant to this study. Tabulation, integration, and results: Three hundred sixty-six rudimentary horn presentations (210 gynecologic and 156 obstetric) were found. Noncommunicating horns accounted for 92...|$|E
40|$|Background: Allergy is {{diagnosed}} from typical symptoms, and tests are performed to incriminate the suspected precipitant. Skin prick tests (SPTs) are commonly performed, inexpensive, and give immediate results. Laboratory tests (ImmunoCAP) for serum allergen-specific IgE antibodies are usually performed more selectively. The immuno-solid phase allergen chip (ISAC) enables testing for specific IgE against multiple allergen components in a multiplex assay. Methods: We retrospectively analysed clinic <b>letters,</b> <b>case</b> notes, and laboratory results of 118 patients attending the National Adult Allergy Service at the University Hospital of Wales who presented diagnostic difficulty, to evaluate which testing strategy (SPT, ImmunoCAP, or ISAC) {{was the most}} appropriate to use to confirm the diagnosis in these complex patients, evaluated in a “real-life” clinical service setting. Results: In patients with nut allergy, the detection rates of SPTs (56 %) and ISAC (65 %) were {{lower than those of}} ImmunoCAP (71 %). ISAC had a higher detection rate (88 %) than ImmunoCAP (69 %) or SPT (33 %) in the diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome. ImmunoCAP test results identified all 9 patients with anaphylaxis due to wheat allergy (100 %), whereas ISAC was positive in only 6 of these 9 (67 %). Conclusions: In this difficult diagnostic group, the ImmunoCAP test should be the preferred single test for possible allergy to nuts, wheat, other specific foods, and anaphylaxis of any cause. In these conditions, SPT and ISAC tests give comparable results. The most useful single test for oral allergy syndrome is ISAC, and SPT should be the preferred test for latex allergy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Patients with {{peripheral}} arterial disease (PAD), aneurysmal disease (AD) or carotid atherosclerosis are at high cardiovascular risk, necessitating secondary cardiovascular protection. The aim of {{this study}} was to determine compliance with cardiovascular risk reduction guidelines in new patients referred to vascular clinics. Methods A multicentre collaborative national observational audit of new patients referred to eight tertiary general vascular clinics over a three-month period in England and Wales was conducted by the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN). Referral <b>letters,</b> <b>case</b> notes and investigations were reviewed by local investigators, and data analysed by VERN. Results A total of 656 patients were included in the study: 73. 2 % had PAD, 23. 2 % had AD and 3. 7 % had carotid atherosclerosis. A third (37. 5 %) were current smokers, two-thirds (61. 7 %) were on antiplatelet therapy and two-thirds (61. 5 %) were on statin therapy. Smoking was more prevalent in the PAD cohort (PAD 41. 4 %, AD 27. 5 %, p= 0. 003). However, more PAD patients were on antiplatelet therapy (PAD 63. 9 %, AD 53. 3 %, p= 0. 024). Both antiplatelet and statin prescription significantly increased with the number of cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with a previous cardiac or cerebrovascular history were more likely to have stopped smoking, and to be on antiplatelet and statin therapy (p< 0. 0001 for each). Overall, 47. 3 % of patients were on both antiplatelet and statin therapy, and 28. 9 % were on antiplatelet and statin therapy and not smoking. Conclusions This study highlights deficiencies in cardiovascular risk minimisation in patients with established vascular disease. Patients with concomitant cardiac or cerebrovascular disease were more likely to be on best medical therapy...|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related {{quality of life}} in children and adolescents has been mostly investigated in those young people with chronic disease conditions. No systematic review to date has synthesized the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related {{quality of life in}} the general healthy population of children and adolescents. The {{purpose of this study was}} to review systematically the existing literature that evaluated the relations between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life in the general population of children and adolescents. We conducted a computer search for English language literature from databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO and PubMed-related articles as well as the reference lists of existing literature between 1946 and the second week of January 2017 to retrieve eligible studies. We included the studies that assessed associations between physical activity and/or sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life among the general population of children and adolescents aged between 3 - 18 years. The study design included cross-sectional, longitudinal and health intervention studies. We excluded the studies that examined associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life among children and adolescents with specific chronic diseases, and other studies and reports including reviews, meta-analyses, study protocols, comments, <b>letters,</b> <b>case</b> reports and guidelines. We followed up the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in the reporting of this review. The risk of bias of the primary studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized the difference in health-related quality of life scores between different levels of physical activity and sedentary time. In total, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized in the review. Most of the included studies used a cross-sectional design (n = 21). There were six longitudinal studies and three school-based physical activity intervention studies. One study used both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. We found that higher levels of physical activity were associated with better health-related quality of life and increased time of sedentary behavior was linked to lower health-related quality of life among children and adolescents. A dose-response relation between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life was observed in several studies suggesting that the higher frequency of physical activity or the less time being sedentary, the better the health-related quality of life. The findings in this study suggest that school health programs promoting active lifestyles among children and adolescents may contribute to the improvement of health-related quality of life. Future research is needed to extend studies on longitudinal relationships between physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life, and on effects of physical activity interventions on health-related quality of life among children and youth...|$|E

50|$|Minuscule writing {{remained}} in use for handwriting throughout the Byzantine {{and into the}} post-Byzantine era. In the modern era, western printers used minuscule book hands {{as a model for}} developing early Greek print fonts.

From this practice, the modern orthographic system of <b>letter</b> <b>case</b> for Greek arose.
