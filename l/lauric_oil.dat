40|$|Recently, NGOs such as Green Peace, Friend of the Earth, Earthaction, World Wide Life Fund (WWF) {{and many}} others, have {{propagated}} environmental thinking and forcibly campaigned their respective legislators to label the tropical products as green and eco-friendly. In the US, the American Soybean Association (ASA), American Heart Savers' Association and other interest groups have lobbied the American Congress and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to label tropical {{oils and fats}} (palm oil, palm kernel and coconut oils) as saturated fats. Moll (1987) deliberately labelled and grouped palm oil as <b>lauric</b> <b>oil</b> although the fatty acid composition of palm oil {{is far from being}} lauric (i. e. 0. 03 % of lauric acid; Goh, 1991). Iran is the only country in the world that insists on labelling palm oil as "not fit for human consumption" despite the fact that more than a hundred other countries are importing and using palm oil for edible purposes. Recently, the rubber industry was again thrown into confusion after a paper was published in the US allegating that natural rubber products contain "harmful" substance which presumably could affect the health of the users. In other European countries, such as Holland and Austria, the local NGOs have demanded that tropical timber and furniture be conspicuously labelled as tropical timber for easy identification and subjected to boycott (Ahmad, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|The coconut {{industry}} {{is one of}} the country's major pillars in employment generation and foreign exchange earnings. However, local production problems, the expansion in coconut hectarage of neighboring countries, and recent developments in biotechnology research on other competing crops that have high <b>lauric</b> <b>oil</b> content might affect its long-term sustainability and viability. In a highly liberalized global trade environment, innovation and creativity in the country's coconut industry are needed for survival (Boceta, 1997). In order for the Philippines to be globally competitive, the country must exert all efforts to increase coconut productivity, lower the cost of processing copra, coconut oil, dessicated coconut, and other coconut products, improve the quality of copra and coconut oil, and develop downstream high-value coconut products through technological developments. Indonesia has already dislodged the Philippines as the world's largest producer of coconut. Recently, the increasing share of Indonesia in the world market is also threatening the Philippines 9 ̆ 2 position as the top exporter of coconut oil in the world. Unless the weaknesses and threats in the Philippine coconut industry are faced, the country's share in the world market for coconut oil will continue to diminish. This paper, therefore, aims to present an industry profile with focus on domestic production, consumption, external trade, problems/constraints, and market potentials; review past researches on coconut, technologies generated, and the extent of participation of the private and public sectors; identify research and technology gaps for the coconut industry; identify strengths and weaknesses in the institutional structure of research and extension interface, as well as research complementation efforts; and suggest recommendations and R&D agenda for the coconut industr...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvest of}} the first {{commercial}} crop of a genetically engineered oilseed plant took place last summer, in the south-east of America. The rapeseed plant had been altered by the biotechnology company Calgene of Davis, California, to produce tropical oils similar to those more usually extracted from coconuts and palm kernels. One of the critics of this development is the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), a group that campaigns on behalf of farmers in poor countries. Hope Shand, research director at RAFI, fears that such developments would {{have a major impact}} tin the countries that depend on sales of 'naturally, produced' coconut and palm oil which, in many cases, comes from small farmers who grow coconut or oil palm alongside other crops. Hope Shand believes that this genetically engineered oilseed rape {{is a perfect example of}} how genetic engineering may impoverish the Third World rather than helping it to develop. In reply, Roger Salameh, a market analyst with Calgene, says that the altered rapeseed poses no threat to the countries which produce tropical oils because their aim is to produce a reliable oil source to buffer the US market from the wildly fluctuating crops of tropical countries. In 1993 the US imported 600, 000 tonnes of <b>lauric</b> <b>oil,</b> while Calgene's goal for the new rapeseed plant is to produce only about 10 % of the lauric oils used in the US.

50|$|As {{the price}} of crude oil rose in the late 1970s, {{manufacturers}} switched from petrochemicals to oleochemicals because plant-based <b>lauric</b> <b>oils</b> processed from palm kernel oil were cheaper.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades the {{oleochemistry}} has gradually flooded our everyday life through a mass of products and applications. This is mainly due to the wide structural diversity and reactivity of fatty acids and the growing demand for bio-sourced goods. Today, almost {{one quarter of the}} global vegetable oil production is dedicated to non- food applications, the contribution of animal fats being much more modest. Excepted biodiesels, the chemical applications of tropical edible oils depend on their fatty acids composition: <b>lauric</b> <b>oils</b> (coconut and palm kernel) and palm stearin will be mostly converted into surface actives ingredients while unsaturated oils rather will be subjected to double bond functionalization or cracking. Alongside of major vegetable oils only a few non-edible tropical oils are exclusively intended to oleochemistry such as Castor and Jatropha. Some other non-food oilseed crops (Cuphea, Lesquerella, Vernonia, black mustard [...] .) are promising but further researches are still needed for their development in Southern Countries. In the future, the production increase of major vegetable oils and the development of new ones will face many challenges relating to environmental issues, competition between food and non-food uses and between non-food applications themselves.

40|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} CPO (Crude Palm Oil) and CPKO (Crude Palm Kernel Oil) {{producer}} in the world. Indonesia has been producing around 40 palm oil-based products, while Malaysia has been producing more than 100 palm oil-based products. Indonesia exports more CPO and CPKO whereas Malaysia mainly exports derivative products of CPO and CPKO (including oleochemicals). Oleochemicals are chemicals derived from natural oils or fats (from plants or animals). Basic oleochemicals consist of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, methyl esters, fatty amines, and glycerol. Raw materials {{being used in the}} production of oleochemicals are tallow, stearin (derivative products of CPO), and <b>lauric</b> <b>oil</b> (CPKO and coconut oil). This study focuses on Indonesian palm oil-based fatty acid and fatty alcohol industry since Indonesia {{is the largest}} CPO and CPKO producer in the world, fatty acids and fatty alcohols are the most important basic oleochemicals in term of production and consumption, both are the most widely used oleochemicals, and fatty alcohols can be produced from fatty acids (called fatty acid route) so that both is better studied together even though their applications and markets are different. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify and examine factors affecting the performance of Indonesian palm oil-based fatty acid and fatty alcohol industry and to develop a competitiveness model of the industry based on Industrial Organization (IO) theory, especially the Porter Diamond concept. The aim of this study is also to determine priority management of the industry based on gap analysis between the current and ideal (future) conditions of the industry, using competitiveness framework being developed by International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and World Economic Forum (WEF). The aim of this study is also to identify, analyze, and sythesize main problems in developing the competitiveness of the industry, using competitiveness framework being developed by IMD and WEF, and analytic network process (ANP) method. The final aim of this study is to analyze best strategy in developing the competitiveness of the industry, using ANP-BOCR (Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, Risks) method. This study used literature review, descriptive analysis, in-depth interview, and questionnaire (based on Likert scale of 1 – 9) methods to gather opinions from the experts and/or practitioners (15 persons) on the current and ideal (future) conditions of the industry. The experts and/or practitioners were selected by purposive sampling method from the supply chain of Indonesian palm oil-based fatty acid and fatty alcohol industry. Questionnaires were developed by using competitiveness framework being developed by IMD and WEF, and ANP method. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the differences between both conditions. The results of this study show that according to the competitiveness model of Indonesian palm oil-based fatty acid and fatty alcohol industry, there are some sub-factors whose status of ‘good’ and the other sub-factors are still at ‘poor’ status. The ‘poor’ sub-factors apparently are weaknesses and must be improved as soon as possible. The results of this study also show that the biggest gap between the current and ideal (future) conditions of the industry, using IMD competitiveness framework is government efficiency while the smallest gap is business efficiency. The results of this study also show that the gap for total factors using IMD competitiveness framework is 27. 84...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Increasingly, {{over the}} past 40 years, the {{conception}} of diet has undergone major changes. Many of these changes involve changes in dietary intake of fats and oils. There has been an increasing consumption of partially hydrogenated trans- vegetable oils and a decreasing intake of <b>lauric</b> acid-containing <b>oils.</b> Although popular literature usually attribute {{an increased risk of}} coronary heart disease (CHD) to elevated levels of serum cholesterol, which in turn are thought to derive from an increased dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. The palm oil and palm kernel oil are high in saturated fatty acids, about 50 % and 80 % respectively and are esterified with glycerol. In developing countries, vegetable oils are replacing animal fats because of the cost and health concerns. It is reassuring to know that the consumption of palm oil as a source of dietary fat does not pose any additional risks for coronary artery disease when consumed in realistic amounts as part of a healthy diet...|$|R
50|$|Coconut oil {{contains}} {{a large proportion}} of lauric acid, a saturated fat that raises total blood cholesterol levels by increasing both the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although this may create a more favorable total blood cholesterol profile, this does not exclude the possibility that persistent consumption of coconut oil may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease through other mechanisms, particularly via the marked increase of blood cholesterol induced by lauric acid. Because the majority of saturated fat in coconut <b>oil</b> is <b>lauric</b> acid, coconut <b>oil</b> may be preferred over partially hydrogenated vegetable oil when solid fats are used in the diet.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of one global vegetable oil market. We analyze the historic price developments in the period 2000 {{until the end of}} 2015 of fish oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil and linseed oil. The existence of one market can be investigated by the means of Johansen cointegration tests. There is statistical evidence which suggests that there is a strong relationship among the oils in the long-run. The quality of the oils and which end-users the oils have, are the main factors which cause the degree of integration. The general oils (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and palm oil) which are close substitutes in the cooking and margarine manufacturing are cointegrated over the full period. In addition, the law of one price is accepted for these oils. Tests of all ten oils as in one system rejects the law of one price, but suggests cointegration in the long-run. The <b>lauric</b> <b>oils,</b> coconut and palm kernel oil, are considered as cointegrated and forms a separate sub-market within the global vegetable oil market. Hence, the degree of market integration is strongly linked to the qualities of the oils. Fish oil has risen to become a premium oil compared to the other vegetable oils. During the commodity boom era, fish oil formed a stationary linear relationship with rapeseed oil. The observed integration between the two {{can be explained by the}} degree of substitution of fish oil by rapeseed oil as input in salmon feed – fish oil and rapeseed oil was substitutes in this period, despite fish oil’s premium qualities as a source of Omega- 3. There is a break around June 2011 which caused rapeseed oil (and the other vegetable oils) to diverge from fish oil. The high price of fish oil in the recent years is deemed as a result of high demand of fish oil in a new Omega- 3 market for human consumption. Thus, fish oil is no longer considered as integrated with the vegetable oils. The high prices of fish oil has caused the salmon feed costs to increase, as fish oil is an important input in the feed. The demand of fish oil is believed to be high in the future, both from the aquaculture industry and the Omega- 3 market. Therefore, we believe that the price of fish oil will be traded at premium compared to the vegetable oils in the future...|$|R

Five samples have been analyzed. One sample presented the composition of fatty acids, tocopherols and desmethylsterols of authentic sesame oil. Another one presented only non complying parameters. Three other samples showed the fatty acid composition of pure sesame oil, but the tocopherol and desmethylsterol profiles did not comply with those for sesame seed oil.

Cultures fed LUA and LA had a high abundance of Clostridium sp., Clostridium propionicum and Propionibacterium acnes. In comparison, BES and furfural fed cultures contained large fractions of Clostridium sp., Eubacteria sp. and Bacteroides sp. while in the fish oil fed cultures, the dominant organism detected was Eubacteria sp.

40|$|Recently, the {{abundant}} and biodegradable biomass {{was reported to}} be convenient for oil spill clean–up due to its low-cost and environmental friendly. One of the agricultural wastes, namely oil palm leaves (OPL) were chemically modified by a fatty acid, lauric acid (LA) and employed as an adsorbent to remove crude oil from aqueous solution. The textural and surface properties of the <b>lauric</b> acid modified <b>oil</b> palm leaves (OPLLA) were characterized by FTIR, FESEM, and N 2 adsorption. Thermal stability of the adsorbents was characterized by TGA. The effect of several parameters such as solution pH, loading of adsorbent, contact time, initial crude oil concentration, and adsorption temperature on crude oil adsorption were investigated. It was found that addition of LA created non-polar layer on oil palm leaves surface, thus endowing OPLLA with much better adsorption capacity for crude oil removal from aqueous solution. The adsorption was found to be dependent on all the studied parameters. The kinetic study revealed that adsorption process was rapid and obeyed pseudo second-order model. The equilibrium time was short and could be achieved within 20 minutes. Isotherm study indicated that the oil adsorption was fitted well by Freundlich model. The maximum adsorption capacity of OPLLA controlled by the solubilization mechanism was 1176. 00 ± 12. 92 mg g- 1 with the removal percentage of 42. 00 ± 0. 46 % at 303 K. The potential of OPLLA to adsorb crude oil from crude oil contaminated seawater achieved 34. 02 ± 0. 45 % removal with the maximum adsorption capacity of 952. 66 ± 11. 31 mg g- 1.
