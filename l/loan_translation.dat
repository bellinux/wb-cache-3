25|$|A loanword is {{distinguished}} from a calque (<b>loan</b> <b>translation),</b> {{which is a}} word or phrase whose meaning or idiom is adopted from another language by translation into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language.|$|E
25|$|Examples of idiomatic {{expressions}} include Surs. dar in canaster, Engad. dar ün dschierl, {{a direct}} translation of German 'einen Korb geben', literally meaning 'to hand a basket', but {{used in the}} sense of 'turning down a marriage proposal' or esser ligiongia ad enzatgi, a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> of the German expression jemandem Wurst sein, literally meaning 'to be sausage to someone' but meaning 'not cared about, to be unimportant'.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, {{it is not}} always easy to establish the original language of a place name, because loan translations are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of <b>loan</b> <b>translation,</b> see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, some place names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies {{must be taken into account}} when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at a certain point in time.|$|E

Some examples appear below: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lexical purism: {{directed}} at the lexicon, first of all against direct lexical loans, often combined {{with the development of}} <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> (such as in Norwegian: hand out > støtteark and snowboard > snøbrett or Arabic tilifūn > hātif and kumbyūtir > ḥāsūb.|$|R
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} type genus Myrmeleo– and thus, the family as a whole– is derived from Ancient Greek léon (λέων) [...] "lion" [...] + mýrmex (μύρμηξ) [...] "ant", in a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> of the names common across Europe. In most European and Middle Eastern languages, at least the larvae are known under the local term corresponding to [...] "antlion".|$|E
500|$|A common {{term for}} Muslim was Saracen; before the 16th century, the words [...] "Muslim" [...] and [...] "Islam" [...] were rarely used by Europeans. In Greek and Latin, [...] "Saracen" [...] {{originated}} in the early first millennium to refer to non-Arab peoples inhabiting the desert areas around the Roman province of Arabia. The term evolved to include Arab tribes, and by the 12th century it was an ethnic and religious marker synonymous with [...] "Muslim" [...] in Medieval Latin literature. Frank and Latin were used during the Crusades for Western Europeans, distinguishing them from Greeks. Medieval Muslim historiographers such as Ali ibn al-Athir refer to the Crusades as the [...] "Frankish Wars" [...] (...) [...] The term used in modern Arabic, , lit. [...] " [...] of the [...] ", is a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> of the term Crusade as used in Western historiography.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian first adopted loanwords from Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often through Uighur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and Chinese. However, {{more recent}} loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language {{commissions}} of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, {{so as the}} Mongolian vocabulary now has jerönhijlögč 'president' ("generalizer") and šar ajrag 'beer' ("yellow kumys"). There are several <b>loan</b> <b>translations,</b> e.g., galt tereg 'train' ('fire-having cart') from Chinese huǒchē (火车, fire cart) 'train'. Other <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> include mön chanar (essence) from Chinese shízhì (实质, true quality), khün am (population) from Chinese rénkǒu (人口, person mouth), erdene shish (corn, maize) from Chinese yùmǐ (玉米, jade rice) and bügd nairamdakh uls (republic) from Chinese gónghéguò (共和国, public collaboration nation).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} {{instances}} of Afrikaans using calques or <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> where Dutch uses an English loanword, {{such as the}} word for [...] "milkshake", melkskommel, from melk ("milk") and skommel ("shake" [...] or [...] "shuffle") in contrast to Dutch, in which the original English word is untranslated.|$|R
50|$|While Afrikaans uses purisms or <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> where Dutch {{would use}} loans from French, Latin or English, {{owing to the}} {{exposure}} of Afrikaans speakers to English, Dutch words like computer, lift and appartement are more readily understood by them than Afrikaans equivalents like rekenaar, hysbak and woonstel are by Dutch speakers.|$|R
2500|$|Another theory {{says that}} testis is {{influenced}} by a <b>loan</b> <b>translation,</b> from Greek parastatēs [...] "defender (in law), supporter" [...] that is [...] "two glands side by side".|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "iceberg" [...] is {{a partial}} <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> from the Dutch word ijsberg, {{literally}} meaning [...] ice mountain, cognate to Danish isbjerg, German Eisberg, Low Saxon Iesbarg and Swedish isberg.|$|E

50|$|Contact {{phenomena}} {{have been}} observed in the reverse direction, from a sign language to an oral language. Hearing adults {{who grew up in}} deaf signing households as children of deaf adults (CODAs) sometimes communicate with one another in spoken and written English and knowingly use ASL <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> and underlying grammatical forms.|$|R
50|$|Owing to the {{geographical}} and later political isolation of South Africa from the Netherlands, Afrikaans vocabulary diverged {{from that of}} Dutch, coining purisms or using <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> rather than adopting terms found in English, as English was perceived as being a greater threat to Afrikaans in South Africa {{than it was to}} Dutch in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the week, on the other hand, was adopted from the Romans, from about the first century, the various Germanic {{languages}} having adopted the Greco-Roman system of naming of {{the days of the}} week after the classical planets, inserting <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> for the names of the planets, substituting the names of Germanic gods in a process known as [...]|$|R
2500|$|A common {{euphemism}} is [...] [...] This {{is similar}} to the usage in American English of [...] "washroom", which literally means a room where something is washed, and [...] "toilet", which literally refers to the act of self-cleaning. It is also common to see another <b>loan</b> <b>translation,</b> , on signs in department stores and supermarkets, as well as accompanying the public toilet pictogram.|$|E
2500|$|The Slavic {{name is a}} <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> {{of earlier}} Scythian Rā (...) [...] "Volga", {{literally}} [...] "wetness", cognate with Avestan Raŋhā [...] "mythical stream" [...] (also compare the derivation Sogdian r’k [...] "vein, blood vessel" [...] (*raha-ka), Persian [...] rag [...] "vein") and Sanskrit rasā́- (रसा) [...] "dew, liquid, juice; mythical river". The Scythian name survives in modern Mordvin Rav (...) [...] "Volga".|$|E
2500|$|German {{also often}} {{serves as a}} model for the {{creation}} of new words. An example is Surs. tschetapuorla 'vacuum cleaner', a compound of tschitschar 'to suck' and puorla 'dust', following the model of German Staubsauger – the Italian word, aspirapolvere possibly being itself a calque on the German word. The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted aspiradur from Italian aspiratore, which, however, does not mean [...] "vacuum cleaner". The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted aspiradur from Italian aspiratore. A skyscraper, which is a direct <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> from English in many Romance languages (as in French gratte-en-ciel, Italian grattacielo), is a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> of German Wolkenkratzer (literally 'cloud-scraper') in Sursilvan: il sgrattaneblas (from sgrattar 'to scratch' and neblas 'clouds'). The Engadinese varieties again follow the Italian pattern of sgrattatschêl (from tschêl 'sky'). A more recent word is la natelnumra 'the cell phone number', which follows the word order of Swiss German Natelnummer, and is found alongside la numra da natel.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhraseological <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> can be {{described}} as a special type of Anglicisms (Picone 1996 : 3), less evident to the naked eye than loanwords or other direct or semi-direct borrowings. Nevertheless they are pervasive and extremely widespread in all European language families and constitute a major sign of globalization, in general, and of linguistic Anglicization, in particular. French (Fr) and Bulgarian (Bu), and their sister languages for that matter, are no exception to this global trend. An important number of these <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> have been detected in corpora, the media and on the Internet such as Fr. franchir la ligne rouge and Bu. пресичам червената линия (to cross the red line), Fr. être sur le même bateau and Bu. в една и съща лодка сме (be in the same boat) or Fr. au milieu de nulle part and Bu. в средата на нищото (in the middle of nowhere). Lexicographical, typographical, contextual and multilingual methodological criteria have been used in selecting potential <b>loan</b> <b>translations.</b> Even though most of the strings are calques in both languages, a few of them can be said to be specific to one language or the other, even though specificity should be regarded rather as frequency of use and consequently degree of integration in the recipient language. Some instances of language-specific calques are Bu. имаш пеперуди в стомаха (have butterflies in the stomach) and слон в стаята (an elephant in the room) or Fr. ce n'est pas ma tasse de thé (it's not my cup of tea) and été indien (Indian summer) ...|$|R
5000|$|Petuh (Petu) {{is a mixed}} {{language}} of Flensburg, a mixture of German, Low German, Danish, and Southern Jutish spoken in Flensburg on the German-Danish border. It is High German in vocabulary (with some Danish concepts and <b>loan</b> <b>translations),</b> but it has Danish and Low Saxon grammar and syntax. It originated in the 19th century and was still vibrant in the 1950s, but it {{is now on the}} verge of extinction.|$|R

2500|$|Although the Greek {{appears to}} be a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> of the Hebrew phrase avodat elilim, which is attested in rabbinic {{literature}} (e.g., bChul., 13b, Bar.), the Greek term itself is not found in the Septuagint, Philo, Josephus, or in other Hellenistic Jewish writings. The original term used in early rabbinic writings is oved avodah zarah (AAZ, worship of avoda zara, or [...] "pagan"), [...] while avodat kochavim umazalot (AKUM, worship of planets and constellations) is not found in its early manuscripts.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, kāwanatanga is a <b>loan</b> <b>{{translation}}</b> from 'governorship' and was {{not part}} of the Māori language. The term had been used by Henry Williams in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern Māori chiefs at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated [...] "Ko te Kīngitanga ko te mana i te wenua" [...] to describe [...] "all sovereign power and authority in the land".|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{outright}} loan words, the German {{influence on}} Romansh often {{takes the form}} of calques, where Romanic vocabulary has taken on the meaning of German words, summed up by Italian dialectologist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli in 1880 as [...] "materia romana e spirito tedesco" [...] ("Roman body and German soul). The earliest examples go back to Carolingian times and show the influence of Germanic law. Such words include tschentament 'statute', a derivation of the verb tschentar (from Latin *sedentare 'to sit') as an analogy to Middle High German satzunge or Surs./sut./Surm. lètg, Put. alach, Vall. lai 'marriage', derived from Latin legem (accusative singular of lēx 'law'), with the meaning of Middle High German ê, ewe. A more recent example of a <b>loan</b> <b>translation</b> is the verb tradir 'to betray', which has taken on the additional meaning of German verraten of 'to give away' as in tradir in secret 'to give away a secret', originally covered by the verb revelar.|$|E

25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|R
5000|$|The process {{appears to}} be very common in those sign {{languages}} that have been best documented, such as American Sign Language, British Sign Language and Auslan.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning {{dynamics}} behind {{the conceptualization of}} glass ceiling (effect) as a general term and a cultural keyword (Williams 1976 / 1983), related word-formations, and the mechanism of re-conceptualization of its calque, <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> and related compounds in Italian. Integrating the tools of corpus linguistics (Scott 2005) with insights from Štekauer’s (2005) Meaning Predictability Theory, Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff 1987, Lakoff/Johnson 1980, 1999) and Dobrovol’skij/Piirainen (2005), we focus on meaning descriptions (Wiegand 1992) in expository texts from the specialist press, research articles, dictionaries, glossaries, encyclopaedic entries (for English) and textbook sections (for Italian). As will be seen, glass ceiling finds its motivation in knowledge of material culture and aspects of artefacts. It activates the orientational metaphors UP – DOWN, the Career ICM (SUCCESSFUL IS UP; UNSUCCESSFUL IS DOWN; MAKING A CAREER IS UP), the metaphor DIFFICULTIES ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO MOTION, and the concepts FORCE and CONTROL. However, while English glass-ceiling describes a (hidden) limit and a barrier {{to the advancement of}} women and other minorities, covering potential cultural keywords such as equal opportunities (for all) and social mobility in a fluid society, its Italian calque and <b>loan</b> <b>translations</b> show conceptual narrowing in that they appear to only address gender (IN) EQUALITY...|$|R
