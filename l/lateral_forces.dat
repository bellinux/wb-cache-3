5|$|Tires {{generate}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
25|$|With {{the model}} {{mounted on a}} force balance, one can measure lift, drag, <b>lateral</b> <b>forces,</b> yaw, roll, and {{pitching}} moments over a range of angle of attack. This allows one to produce common curves such as lift coefficient versus angle of attack (shown).|$|E

An inner primary coating {{is designed to}} act as a shock absorber to minimize attenuation caused by microbending. An outer secondary coating protects the primary coating against mechanical damage and acts as a barrier to <b>lateral</b> <b>forces,</b> and may be colored to differentiate strands in bundled cable constructions.|$|E
50|$|Insofar as the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> {{is the one}} acting {{side-to-side}} {{along the}} tire axle, <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> will change. As the tire rotates it may exert a <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> {{on the order of}} 25 pounds, causing steering pull in one direction. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 22 pounds and 26 pounds would be characterized as a 4-pound <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> variation, or LFV. LFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described above. <b>Lateral</b> <b>force</b> is signed, such that when mounted on the vehicle, the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> may be positive, making the vehicle pull to the left, or negative, pulling to the right.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a procedure}} for the calibration of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> {{applied to a}} triangular cantilever tip {{by means of a}} <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> microscope. The force is directed perpendicular to the cantilever major axis. The <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> results in a torsion of the cantilever. The torsion signal is monitored as a voltage on a four-sector photodiode. The conversion from a torsion signal to a <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> depends on the optical geometry of the instrument and the cantilever shape, dimensions and material properties. The calibration procedure used requires a calculation of the elasticity of the cantilever and experimental data.

Amtrak uses them on a high-speed service between Washington, D.C. and Boston via New York City and Philadelphia along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in the Northeast United States.

25|$|A {{typical circuit}} usually {{features}} {{a stretch of}} straight road on which the starting grid is situated. The pit lane, where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout {{of the rest of}} the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal.|$|E
500|$|The 58-story Trump Tower is [...] high, {{making it}} the 64th tallest {{building}} in New York City. The tower, designed by Der Scutt of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, is a reinforced concrete shear wall core structure and, {{at the time of}} its completion, was the tallest structure of its type in the city. The 28-sided structure, with a stepped facade, was intended to give the tower more window exposure. A concrete hat-truss at the top of the building, similar to one used in the Trump World Tower, ties exterior columns with the concrete core. This hat-truss increases the effective dimensions of the core to that of the building which allows the building to resist the overturning of <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> such as those caused by wind, minor earthquakes, and other impacts perpendicular to the building's height.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>force</b> is a {{reaction}} {{supplied by the}} underwater shape of a sailboat, the blades of an ice boat and the wheels of a land sailing craft. Sailboats rely on keels, centerboards, and other underwater foils, including rudders, that provide lift in the lateral direction, to provide hydrodynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> (PLAT) to offset the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> component acting on the sail (FLAT) and minimize leeway. Such foils provide hydrodynamic lift and, for keels, ballast to offset heeling. They incorporate {{a wide variety of}} design considerations.|$|R
30|$|Haptic {{interaction}} is imperative for intuitive operation of computer systems. In modern computer devices, the touch-screen technology has realized intuitive operations {{that allow us}} to directly touch graphical icons on the screen. However, users are sometimes frustrated due to the lack of appropriate feedback; implementing haptic feedback is expected to enrich the user experience. On flat screens, providing force feedback in vertical direction is considerably difficult, and thus many studies have tried to implement <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> feedback, in which the feedback force is provided within lateral two dimensions. Such <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> feedback has been regarded as effective enough, since surface geometry recognition of humans is closely related with <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> as reported in some studies [1, 2]. For example, <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> can create an illusion of corrugated shapes on flat surfaces [2].|$|R
30|$|The {{strength}} of the HOPG basal plane is high; therefore, no fracture occurred due to tip sliding. The processing depth of mica is shallow; however, its <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is {{higher than that of}} MoS 2. A comparison of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> wave patterns of MoS 2 and mica suggests that the greater amount of processing debris and roughness of the processed track observed in MoS 2 are responsible for the greater <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> change observed for MoS 2. Processed surface roughness and change in <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> seem {{to be related to the}} size of destruction by the diamond tip sliding. These results are explained by the larger destruction sizes observed in MoS 2 processing compared to those in mica due to the higher {{strength of}} the MoS 2 basal plane.|$|R
500|$|The massive {{skull of}} Albertosaurus, which {{was perched on}} a short, S-shaped neck, was about [...] long in the largest adults. Wide {{openings}} in the skull (fenestrae) reduced {{the weight of the}} head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, Gorgosaurus at least 62. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The premaxillary teeth {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in cross section. Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary (cheek) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.|$|E

2500|$|Their high {{kinetic energy}} {{translates}} to higher horsepower-to-ton ratios (e.g. [...] ); this allows trains to accelerate and maintain higher speeds and negotiate steep grades as momentum builds up and recovered in downgrades (reducing cut, fill, and tunnelling requirements).

All these features are dramatically different from freight operations, thus justifying exclusive high-speed rail lines if it is economically feasible.|$|E

50|$|As the {{axial load}} on a {{perfectly}} straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a <b>lateral</b> <b>force,</b> applied {{between the two}} ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.|$|R

2500|$|A new {{structural}} system of framed tubes {{was developed in}} 1963. Fazlur Khan and J.

[...] Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads (primarily wind) are supported by the structure as a whole. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space, and about half the exterior surface is available for windows. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. Tube structures cut down costs, {{at the same time}} allowing buildings to reach greater heights. Concrete tube-frame construction was first used in the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, completed in Chicago in 1963, and soon after in the John Hancock Center and World Trade Center.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of technologies—including active {{suspension}} and ground effect aerodynamics —are banned under the current regulations. Despite this {{the current generation of}} cars can reach speeds in excess of [...] at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was , set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. A Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave desert achieved a top speed of [...] in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations. Even with the limitations on aerodynamics, at [...] aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to [...] "drive on the ceiling", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20kg in corners. Such high <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Ferrari Enzo only achieves around 1g.|$|E

In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> to induce track buckling. Two kinds of cross sections of ballasted track for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference of the cross section of ballasted track on the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force.</b> The results of the shaking table test clarified that the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the ballasted track decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> smaller than the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the ballasted track after shaking.

40|$|During curve {{driving a}} <b>lateral</b> <b>force,</b> coupled to the off-center yaw rotation, is {{acting on the}} driver. In simulation, however, the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is often not {{generated}} using off-centric rotation, thereby uncoupling translational and rotational motion cues. This may cause misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> w. r. t. the motion direction along the curve. In the present study we investigated how sensitive humans are to such misalignment. We performed a psychophysical study where participants were repeatedly moved along circular trajectories. The participants’ physical orientation {{with respect to the}} motion path was systematically varied, and the participants’ task was to indicate whether they felt facing to the inside or the outside of the curve, in a two-alternative forced choice. The experiment was performed in darkness and with a congruent visual motion stimulus. Heading JND, i. e. the smallest detectable difference in yaw orientation w. r. t. the direction of motion, was measured. The results show a considerably lower sensitivity to the misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> than what is commonly found for heading sensitivity along straight paths, with better performance when congruent visual information was presented. This indicates that for simulated curve driving some misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is acceptable, without affecting perceptual realism...|$|R
