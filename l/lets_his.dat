They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron.

When Ron and Wendy get angry, Tom ejects them from the games and declares it a forfeit, which concerns Lucy.|$|E

5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government {{is a waste of}} taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of the}} work.|$|E

Tucker stands in as the godfather of Moses Winters, the son of his longtime friend and confidant, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell).

500|$|NMEs Louis Pattison {{described}} the track as a [...] "curdled take on silky ’70s rare groove legend Roy Ayers" [...] {{and stated that}} it was [...] "actually rather gorgeous". Tiny Mix Tapes commented however that Tyler's [...] "flow is painful to listen to on slower tracks such as [...] "She" [...] though [...] was saved by his ambition [...] production". Max Feldman of PopMatters noted that Tyler [...] "also {{does a lot of}} thinking through the medium of his own genitals, as evidenced on lusty R crooner [...] "She" [...] where he <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> perverse side free." ...|$|E

Drogo melts his belt in a stewpot, and Viserys realises to his horror that the [...] "golden crown" [...] is actually molten gold, which Drogo pours on his head.

500|$|Director Tom Hooper <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, {{with this}} kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to keep us out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} for {{the album was}} mostly positive. Geoff Orens of AllMusic, in a review written years after the album's release, said that {{while some of the}} songs are [...] "dated", the album contains [...] "standout tracks". He describes [...] "Long Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "one of Collins' most effective ballads", and [...] "Take Me Home" [...] as [...] "pulsating". Orens went on to say [...] "It's not a completely satisfying recording, but it is the best example {{of one of the most}} dominating and influential styles of the 1980s." [...] Lori E. Pike of the Los Angeles Times gave the album a grade of an A-, saying that [...] "Collins' recipe of tense vocals spiced with saucy horns and splashy electro-jitterbugging synthesisers often leaves little room for real feeling to squeeze through. When he slows down and <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> smoldering moodiness take over, the effect is magical.".|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E

500|$|Old Slavic mythology knew of men {{who were}} born out of {{relationships}} between women and dragons. These men were endowed with prodigious strength and exceptional abilities. They {{could turn into a}} dragon and fly, which they usually did in crisis situations, like battles. Two such heroes are recorded in the Serbian epic poetry: Sekula Banović and Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk ("Fiery Dragon" [...] Vuk). Both were late-medieval nobles and warriors, to whom mythical attributes were attached in the poetry. Their transformation into a dragon is described in three ways: the hero dresses his [...] "dragon shirt"; he spreads his hidden wings; or he <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> soul out from his body {{in the form of a}} winged snake. The transformation may not be explicitly stated, but implied by a statement which indicates that the hero flies. Russian epic hero Volkh Vseslavevich is described as a son of a dragon; in folk poems, he transforms into a falkon, aurochs, wolf, and some other animals. In a couple of Serbian and Bulgarian folk poems, Saint Nicholas suddenly falls asleep, and while he sleeps, he saves ships from a storm.|$|E
500|$|Bob Fischbach of the Omaha World-Herald {{called the}} {{cinematography}} sharp, the editing crisp, and the acting [...] "uniformly good". He added, [...] "Best of all, {{the writing is}} anchored in reality. Coyle <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> film show rather than tell, and lets viewers reach their own conclusions." [...] Lavender magazine writer John Townsend said the film conveyed compassionate views of Christianity and complimented the cinematography. Townsend particularly praised Baumgartner's performance and described the scenes between Sisto and a young boy troubled by his homosexual feelings (John Skelley) as [...] "exquisite". Chelsa Doyle, a writer with the website Blogcritics, called it [...] "a touching and introspective film about faith, hope and choice". Doyle praised the film's quiet tone and the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, but said it [...] "occasionally gets a little sleepy in the middle", and that the subplot involving Father John's ex-girlfriend could have been cut altogether. Denver Post film critic Lisa Kennedy praised the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, and complimented Coyle's understanding of the pastoral work of a parish priest. However, she added that the film [...] "doesn't break ground as a story, even one about redemption". Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader called it a [...] "cheesy melodrama", and wrote, [...] "Writer-director Patrick Coyle tackles such weighty issues as child abuse, alcoholism, hypocrisy, celibacy, and Catholic reforms, but the movie's spiritual agenda is belied by its voyeurism." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Chris {{would be shocked}} when he realises that Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich) [...] "may have a romantic interest in him." [...] During a charity camp-out, which has been organised by Scotty's girlfriend, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), Scotty visits Chris' tent and says something that makes Chris believe he is making a move on him. Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty <b>lets</b> <b>his</b> attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it. So he kicks Scotty out of the house, but even then Scotty doesn't realise what the kiss means." [...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it. However, they soon learn that Scotty has proposed to Georgia and decide to remain silent to stop her from having her heart broken.|$|E
