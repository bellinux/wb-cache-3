40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The cuckoo ray, <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus,</b> one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus,</b> Raja brachyura, Raja miraletus, Raja undulata, Raja microocellata and Raja montagui, have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in Raja microocellata, lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|E

40|$|Over 50 {{species of}} chondrichthyan fishes are known from waters around the British Isles, of which 26 have been {{recorded}} in The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) trawl surveys. The distribution and relative abundance of dogfishes, skates and rays are described from groundfish surveys in the North Sea, English Channel, Irish Sea and Celtic Sea. The contemporary distribution of species {{in relation to their}} biogeography and major changes in the distribution are discussed. Nursery areas of elasmobranchs were typically in shallower water than adult habitats, a pattern evident for blonde (Raja brachyura), thornback (R. clavata), small-eyed (R. microocellata) and spotted ray (R. montagui). In contrast, juvenile cuckoo ray <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> occurred further offshore and were most abundant in the western Irish Sea and northern St George’s Channel.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to detect changes in the diet and the feeding {{intensity}} of demersal fish caused by fishery discarding, two hauls were carried out 22 h apart {{at a depth of}} 90 m in an area of the Cantabrian Sea closed to trawling. Before the second haul, dead fauna that were not common in the sampling area under natural conditions, such as Micromesistius poutassou and squat lobster (Munida spp.), which are both usually discarded by the fleet and mainly found in deeper water, were thrown overboard. A total of 319 stomach contents from 12 demersal fish species caught in both hauls were analysed. The percentage emptiness decreased in the second haul (32 %) with respect to the first (43 %), {{and at the same time}} the feeding intensity of scavenger species such as Trachinus draco, Pagellus acarne, Scyliorhinus canicula, Raja montagui and <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus</b> increased. Discards of M. poutassou was actually found in the stomach of a typically planktophagous species, Pagellus bogaraveo.

40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} eight {{demersal}} elasmobranchs, three sharks (Etmopterus spinax, Scyliorhinus canicula and Galeus melastomus) and five batoids (Myliobatis aquila, <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus,</b> Raja polystigma, R. miraletus and R. clavata), from the Balearic Sea (western Mediterranean) was analyzed. For each species, the diet and feeding habits {{were characterized by}} depth strata using quantitative indices such as diet overlap, diet breadth and prey diversity. Diet variation with size and depth were also tested for the most abundant species. For shelf-living species, natantian and reptantian crustaceans together with teleosts {{were the most important}} preys. On slope bottoms, euphausiids were the preferential prey for S. canicula and G. melastomus, while E. spinax fed mainly on cephalopods. The most specialist and generalist diet corresponded to G. melastomus living on the upper slope and S. canicula from the continental shelf, respectively. High overlap was found between all the skates on the continental shelf and the sympatric sharks S. canicula and G. melastomus on the slope. Significant overlap was also found between S. canicula and R. clavata on the continental shelf. Size was found to significantly affect the diet of S. canicula, G. melastomus and R. clavata, whereas depth affected exclusively S. canicula...|$|E
40|$|The age, {{growth and}} {{maturity}} of 1 554 individuals (268 Raja brachyura, 258 R. clavata, 468 R. montagui and 560 <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus)</b> {{of the main}} commercial ray species from the Irish Sea were determined from samples taken from commercial and research trawls between 1997 and 1998. Sagittal sections of vertebral centra stained using crystal violet enhanced the underlying band patterns of each species, allowing the derivation of age and von Bertalanffy growth parameters. Age estimates were relatively low for each species, with a maximum age of 7 yr recorded for R. montagui and 8 yr for each other species. Growth rate parameters ranged between K = 0. 093 (L ∞ = 139. 500 and t 0 =- 1. 841) for female R. clavata and K = 0. 304 (L ∞ = 72. 400 and t 0 =- 0. 924) for male R. montagui, and were notably higher for both the smaller growing R. montagui and R. naevus. Morphological assessment of maturity, revealed that; male R. montagui matured at the smallest size (53. 651 cm) and earliest age (3. 410 yrs), male and female R. clavata matured at the greatest age (6. 130 yrs) and female R. brachyura matured at the largest size (83. 560 cm). In each species, an abrupt increase in clasper size in males and nidamental gland width in females was {{closely associated with the}} onset of maturity.

40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (<b>Leucoraja</b> <b>naevus)</b> small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
