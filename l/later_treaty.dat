25|$|The {{area that}} became Michigan had been British territory, and was ceded to the United States in 1783, {{although}} the native {{peoples of the}} area had not ceded control to either the British or Americans {{for most of the}} territory by 1783. The majority of it was gained by cession, coerced or otherwise. The people who resided in Michigan before American settlement were the Ottawa, the Potawatomi, Ojibwa and the Wyandot. Treaties ceding the land were signed between 1795 (the Treaty of Greenville) and 1842 (the Treaty of La Pointe). Other notable treaties were Governor Hull's treaty of 1808, the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819, the two Treaties of Chicago (1821, 1833), the Carey Mission in 1828 and the Treaty of Washington in 1836 and a <b>later</b> <b>treaty</b> of January 4, 1837.|$|E
2500|$|However, some {{misinterpretation}} {{appears to}} have arisen, probably from confusing what happened at Wedmore with the <b>later</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alfred and Guthrum. This led to a [...] "Treaty of Wedmore" [...] as a defining point in Anglo-Saxon history, {{as suggested by the}} map. Whilst {{it is quite possible that}} land arrangements were discussed at Wedmore, or Aller, or elsewhere, following Edington, there is nothing in the sources to provide evidence for this.|$|E

2500|$|Hittite-Egyptian {{relations}} officially began {{once the}} Hatti took over Mitanni's {{role as the}} ruling power in central Syria and from there tensions {{would continue to be}} high until the conclusion of the treaty nearly one hundred years later. During the invasion and eventual defeat of Mitanni, the Hittite armies poured into Syria and began to exert their rule over the Egyptian vassals of Kadesh and Amurru. The loss of these lands in northern Syria would never be forgotten by the Egyptian pharaohs and their later actions demonstrated that they never would fully concede this loss {{at the hands of the}} Hittite Empire. Egypt's attempts to regain the territory lost during the rule of Akhenaten continued to be futile until under the leadership of Seti I, the father of Ramesses II, significant gains did start to be made. In his own Kadesh-Amurru campaign against the Hittite armies, Seti I vanquished his foes at a battle near Kadesh, but the gains proved short-lived since Kadesh was eventually given up by Seti in a <b>later</b> <b>treaty.</b> The short gain by the Egyptians was the [...] "opening salvo" [...] of a conflict between the two nations, which would drag on over the next two decades.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{numerous}} treaties, the Treaty of Zuhab of 1639 is usually considered {{as the most}} important one, as it fixed present Turkey-Iran and Iraq-Iran borders. In <b>later</b> <b>treaties,</b> there were frequent references to the Treaty of Zuhab.|$|R
