It was discovered in 2002 through radial velocity measurements on the parent star. HD 40979 is 33.3 parsecs from Earth, a spectral class F8V star of magnitude 6.74—just past the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> to the naked eye. It is of similar size to the Sun, at 1.1 solar masses and 1.21 solar radii. The planet, with a mass of 3.83 Jupiter masses, orbits with a semi-major axis of 0.83 AU and a period of 263.1 days. HD 45350 has one planet as well. HD 45350 b was discovered through radial velocity measurements in 2004. It has a mass of 1.79 Jupiter masses and orbits every 890.76 days at a distance of 1.92 AU. Its parent star is faint, at an apparent magnitude of 7.88, a G5IV type star 49 parsecs away. It has a mass of 1.02 solar masses and a radius of 1.27 solar radii. HD 43691 b is a significantly larger planet, with a mass of 2.49 Jupiter masses; it is also far closer to its parent star, HD 43691. Discovered in 2007 from radial velocity measurements, it orbits at a distance of 0.24 AU with a period of 36.96 days. HD 43691 has a radius identical to the Sun's, though it is more dense—its mass is 1.38 solar masses. It is a G0IV type star of magnitude 8.03, 93.2 parsecs from Earth.|$|E

Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.|$|E

Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- or far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> is latitude 37°18' north. This is just south of Athens, Richmond (USA), and San Francisco, and very close to Seville and Agrigento. It is almost exactly the latitude of Lick Observatory on Mt.

Under ideal conditions it has been spotted as far north as latitude 37°31' from the Pacific coast. Another northernmost record of visibility came from Mount Nemrut in Turkey, latitude 37°59'. It is more easily visible in places such as the Gulf Coast and Florida, and the island of Crete (Greece) where the best season for viewing it around 9 p.m. is during late January and early February.|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the development of}} optical communications employing semiconductor lasers — both noncoherent and coherent. The large modulation bandwidth obtainable with these devices permits the development of frequency- and pulse-modulation communica-tions systems which overcome scintillation noise produced by the turbulent atmosphere. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} the development of communications systems for 98 -percent weather capability over short ranges, rather than fair-weather capability over long ranges. The development of supporting technology is presented in the areas of semiconductor la-sers, fiber optics, optical systems, narrow-band optical filters, photomultipliers, and fre-quency- and pulse-modulation electronic circuitry and components. Measurements of optical signals over a two-mile path under a full variety of weather con-ditions have permitted a comparative evaluation of AM, FM, and PM systems. The results show clearly the advantage of frequency modulation and pulse modulation.

50|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.The 'diffuse' aurora, on the other hand, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds {{by the fact that}} stars can be seen undiminished through the glow.

30|$|The {{detection}} of stratigraphic features on seismic {{is defined as}} seismic stratigraphy or seismostratigraphic analysis. Several techniques for seismic-stratigraphic analysis have been proposed by many workers, among them Payton (1977), Berg and Woolverton (1985) and Brown (2004). The analysis is highly facilitated using 3 D seismic surveys, {{but it is still}} hard to detect thin sandstone reservoirs. The use of 3 D seismic for field development was first reported by Tegland (1977). 3 D surveys result in clear and more accurate visualization of the subsurface geology and their costs are rapidly recovered by the drilling of development holes, the increase in recoverable reserves, and by the discovery of isolated reservoirs which may be missed (Sheriff and Geldart 1983). The 3 D seismic method increases resolution which is dependent upon wavelength. The seismic wavelength is obtained by dividing velocity and frequency. Seismic velocity increases with depth because the rocks are more compacted. The frequency decreases with depth because the higher frequencies in the seismic signal are more attenuated. The wavelength increases with depth, and the resolution becomes poorer. The limit of separability is equal to one-quarter of a wavelength (or half a period) and is simply the bed thickness corresponding to the closest separation of two wavelets of a given bandwidth (Fig. 6). For intervals thinner than one-quarter of a wavelength, the amplitude is progressively attenuated until the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> is reached, and the reflection signal becomes obscured by the seismic noise (Brown 2004). The <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> depends on the acoustic contrast of the geologic layer of interest relative to the embedding material, the noise in the data, and the shape of the seismic wavelet.|$|E

The chromonemata are double in the telophases and become very thin and reach the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> during the resting stage. This supports the observations of Robertson, McClung and others on the telophase splits in grasshoppers. The chromosome vesicles are formed in the interphase due to the limited centrifugal movement of the chromosome matrices. The chromonemata exhibit a spiral structure in the prophase. The earliest prophase stages show the chromonemata to be double. The chromonemata gradually thicken and uncoil leading to the late prophase chromosomes. ...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{have been}} made {{on the role of}} a {{divalent}} cation (calcium ion) during OsO 4 fixation of nuclei of frog erythrocytes, mainly after isolation from cells. The volume of the nucleus depends partly on the molecular interaction of charged macromolecules, is controlled by the ionic strength of the medium, and hence may be used as a guide in attempts to preserve structure. When the isolation and fixation media contain 0. 01 M calcium at pH 6. 3 the volume changes, in the light microscope, during processing are small. When the fixative does not contain these ions, reversible volume changes occur during fixation and dehydration. The chromatin of nuclei processed with minimal volume change appears, in the electron microscope, to contain fine dots and lines about 20 to 40 A in diameter, relatively close together. The chromatin structure of nuclei in which volume changes have occurred consists of dense irregularly shaped patches, relatively far apart, and ranging in diameter from about 200 A down to the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> (20 to 30 A).
