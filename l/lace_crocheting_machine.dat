40|$|Introduction Human {{designed}} physical patterns, {{while having}} been investigated extensively {{in terms of}} their historical, geographic and cultural significance and their aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have not been fully investigated {{in terms of their}} evolutionary potential. This paper discusses an experimental art research project which focuses on human designed, physical textile patterns to explore pattern as process and investigate the potential for these patterns to evolve and become emergent. The experimental art projects focused on lace and in particular, <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern forms commonly referred to as doilies. 1 <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns are widely recognized, domestically produced hand-made physical patterns created from a low-technology repetitive manual process and located for the most part within a craft context. The project explored the developmental potential of these physical pattern forms by translating them into digital media and working in the digital environment. The research created <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern simulacra {{in the form of a}} series of digital animations written in computer programming code that illustrate how digital <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns form. This paper discusses the properties of lace that make it worthy of further investigation, the motivation behind the selection of <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, and explores the digital environment and its impact on the development of the <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern forms. It then reports how the digital <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, when created in a digital environment and constructed using digital media and manipulated by computational processes, became a hybrid form – that is, an amalgam of human design decisions and computational processes. As such, the <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> simulacra epitomize the intersection of computational processes and human intervention which is common in the digital environment...|$|R

5000|$|Doubling is {{a textile}} {{industry}} term synonymous with combining. It {{can be used}} for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for <b>lace,</b> <b>crochet</b> and knitting. [...] It is used for embroidery threads and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is mercerised, gassed (AKA flamed) and wound onto a bobbin.|$|R

The results showed that blending ratio significantly influenced WVT and WER. Moreover, antibacterial activity of the elastic warp- knitted fabric was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in accordance with AATCC 90 - 2011.

Merrow and Sons in 1870, and incorporated as The Merrow Manufacturing Company in 1893. Originally all of its manufacturing was done at facilities in Merrow, Connecticut and then in Hartford, Connecticut after 1894. The company is currently based in Fall River, Massachusetts.|$|R

It has been proved that bamboo charcoal owns special properties including air purification, water refining, deodorization, far-infrared radiation, and anion release, thus it is widely applied on textile industry in form of fiber and yarn after mixing with its power. This study aims to seek for the optimal twist number of bamboo charcoal (BC) /Nylon(NY) / stainless steel(SS) wrap yarn. And then {{the one or two}} wrap yarns were fed into <b>crocheting</b> <b>machine</b> to weave BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics with different structures. Afterwards, the far-infrared radiation, anion amount, air permeability were discussed by changes of number of layers. The result shows that, as increasing layers of BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics, the far-infrared radiation and air permeability both decrease; but all the single-layer warp knitted fabric reaches above 0. 8, corresponding with the functional standards...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{sportswear}} fabrics are functional textiles {{that can}} mitigate the impaired muscles caused by exercises for the wearers, {{but they can}} also cause discomfort and skin allergy. This study proposes combining two yarns to form functional composite yarns, by using a twisting or wrapping process.

A <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> is used to make the functional composite yarns into functional elastic knits that are suitable for use in sportswear. The test results show that, in comparison to the non-processed yarns, using the twisted or wrapped yarns can considerably decrease the water vapor transmission rate of functional elastic knits by 38 %, while also improving their far infrared emissivity by 13 %, water absorption rate by 39 %, and air permeability by 136 %. In particular, the functional elastic knits that are made of B-wrapped yarns (bamboo charcoal- wrapped yarns), composed of 20 twists per inch, have the optimal diverse functions...|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J.

Merrow's first patent was a <b>machine</b> for <b>crochet</b> stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces <b>crochet</b> <b>machines</b> based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R

However, their evolutionary potential remains under-theorised and, while the digital environment is increasingly used as a design aid for patterns, the developmental potential of lace in a digital environment has not been fully explored. <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns are one example of human-designed physical patterns, which have remained largely stable and consistent throughout various societal, economic and geographical transformations (such as the industrial revolution and globalisation).
