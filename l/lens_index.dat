40|$|AbstractAn optical {{coherence}} tomography {{system has}} been developed that was designed specifically for imaging the isolated crystalline lens. Cross-sectional OCT images were recorded on 40 lenses from 32 human donors with an age range of 6 – 82 years. A method has been developed to measure the axial thickness and average refractive index of the lens from a single recorded image. The measured average group refractive index at the measurement wavelength of 825 nm was converted to the average phase refractive index at 589 nm using lens dispersion data from the literature. The average refractive index for all lenses measured was 1. 408 ± 0. 005 which agrees well with recent MRI measurements of the <b>lens</b> <b>index</b> gradient. A linear regression of the data resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the average refractive index with age, but a simple linear model was insufficient to explain the age dependence. The results presented here suggest that the peak refractive index in the nucleus is closer to 1. 420, rather than the previously accepted value of 1. 406...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} normal ocular development in infant monkeys and to establish both qualitative and quantitative relationships between human and monkey refractive development. MethodsThe subjects were 214 normal rhesus monkeys. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 204 monkeys at about 3 weeks of age and longitudinal data were obtained from 10 representative animals beginning at about 3 weeks of age for a period of up to 5 years. Ocular development was characterized via refractive status, corneal power, crystalline lens parameters, and the eye’s axial dimensions, which were determined by retinoscopy, keratometry, phakometry and A-scan ultrasonography, respectively. ResultsFrom birth to about 5 years of age, the growth curves for refractive error and most ocular components (excluding lens thickness and equivalent <b>lens</b> <b>index)</b> followed exponential trajectories and were highly coordinated between the two eyes. However, overall ocular growth was not a simple process of increasing the scale of each ocular component in a proportional manner. Instead the rates and relative amounts of change varied within and between ocular structures. ConclusionThe configuration and contribution of the major ocular components in infant and adolescent monkey eyes are qualitatively and quantitatively very comparable to those in human eyes and their development proceeds in a similar manner in both species. As a consequence, in both species the adolescent eye is not simply a scaled version of the infant eye...|$|E

Methods: Axial lengths of model eyes were determined using an IOLMaster biometer and a Lenstar; comparing these lengths gave an overall eye index for the Lenstar. Using the Lenstar Graphical User interface, we determined that boundaries between media could be manipulated so that there were opposite changes in optical pathlength {{on either side of}} the boundary and specified changes in distances determined the ratios of media indices. These ratios were combined with the overall eye index to estimate indices. Results: The IOLMaster and Lenstar produced axial length estimates to within ± 0. 01 mm. Estimations of group refractive indices were 1. 340, 1. 341, 1. 415 and 1. 354 for cornea, aqueous, lens and overall eye, respectively. The aqueous and <b>lens</b> <b>indices,</b> but not those for the cornea, are similar to schematic eye <b>indices</b> and reasonable <b>lens</b> <b>indices.</b> Conclusion: The Lenstar appears to use different refractive indices for different ocular media...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose. The mouse eye has {{potential}} to become an important model for studies on the genetic control of eye growth and myopia. However, no data are published {{on the development of}} its optical properties. We developed a paraxial schematic model of the growing eye for the most common laboratory mouse strain, the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse, for the age range between 22 and 100 days. Methods. Refractive development was followed with eccentric infrared photorefraction and corneal curvature with infrared photokeratometry. To measure ocular dimensions, freshly excised eyes were immediately frozen after enucleation to minimize distortions. Eyes were cut with a cryostat down to the bisecting horizontal plane, until the optic nerve head became visible. The standard deviations were ± 10 μm for repeated measurements in highly magnified videographs, taken in several section planes close to the equator in the same eyes. To evaluate inter-eye and inter-individual variability, a total of 20 mice (34 eyes) were studied, with 3 – 4 eyes for each of the 9 sampling ages. Schematic eye models were developed using paraxial ray tracing software (OSLO, LT Lambda Research Corporation, and a self-written program). Results. The measured refractive errors were initially + 4. 0 ± 0. 6 D at approximately 30 days, and levelled off with + 7. 0 ± 2. 5 D at about 70 days. Corneal radius of curvature did not change with age (1. 414 ± 0. 019 mm). Both axial lens diameter and axial eye length grew linearly (regression equations: lens, 1619 μm + 5. 5 μm/day, R= 0. 916; axial length, 2899 μm + 4. 4 μm/day, R= 0. 936). The lens grew so fast that vitreous chamber depth declined with age (regression equation: 896 μm − 3. 2 μm/day, R= 0. 685). The radii of curvature of the anterior lens surface increased during development (from 0. 982 mm at day 22 to 1. 208 mm at day 100), whereas the radii of the posterior lens surface remained constant (− 1. 081 ± 0. 054 mm). The calculated homogeneous <b>lens</b> <b>index</b> increased linearly with age (from 1. 568 to 1. 605). The small eye artifact, calculated from the dioptric difference of the positions of the vitreo-retinal interface and the photoreceptor plane, increased from + 35. 2 to + 39. 1 D, which was much higher than the hyperopia measured with photorefraction. Retinal image magnification increased from 31 to 34 μm/deg, and the f/number remained ⩽ 1 at all ages, suggesting a bright retinal image. A calculated axial eye elongation of 5. 4 – 6. 5 μm was sufficient to make the schematic eye 1 D more myopic. Conclusions. The most striking features of the mouse eye were that linear growth was slow but extended far beyond sexual maturity, that the corneal curvature did not increase, and that the prominent lens growth caused a developmental decline of the vitreous chamber depth...|$|E
40|$|Complex {{artificial}} materials (metamaterials) strongly {{interact with}} light {{and can be}} used to fabricate structures which mimic a material response that has no natural equivalent. Classical tools for the design of optical or radio frequency devices are often ill-suited to utilize such media or have shortcomings in their ability to capture important physics in the device behavior. Recently it has been demonstrated that the structure of Maxwell's equations can be used to exploit this newly available freedom. By leveraging the `form-invariance' of Maxwell's equations under coordinate transforms, it is possible to develop material distributions in which light will behave as though flowing through warped coordinates. This design process is termed `transformation optics' and has inspired the creation of many novel electromagnetic structures such as the invisibility cloak. In this dissertation the tools used in the field of transformation optics will be explored and expanded. Several new designs are discussed, each of which expands upon the ideas that have previously been employed in the field. To begin, I show that the explicit use of a transformation which extends throughout all space may be used to reduce the overall size of an optical device without changing its optical properties. A lens is chosen as a canonical device to demonstrate this behavior. For this work I provided the original idea for a compressing transformation as well as its dielectric-only implementation. I then mentored Dan Roberts as he confirmed the device properties through simulation. I further demonstrate that currents may be succesfully employed within the framework of transformation optics-resulting in novel antenna designs. For this work I suggested handling the sheet currents as the limit of a volumetric current density. I also demonstrated how an intermediate coordinate system could be used to easily handle the types of transformatios which were being explored. For a particular functionality the choice of transformation is, in general, not unique. It is natural, then, to seek optimized transformations which reduce the complexity of the final structure. It was recently demonstrated that for some transformations a numerical scheme could be employed to find quasi-conformal transformations for which the requisite complex material distribution could be well approximated by an isotropic, inhomogeneous media. This process was previously used to demonstrate a carpet cloak-a device which masks a bump in a mirror surface. Unlike the more common transformation optical media, which exhibit strong losses at high frequencies, isotropic designs can be readily made to function at infrared or even optical frequencies. The prospect of leveraging transformation optics in devices which operate at high frequencies, into the infrared and visible, motivates the use of quasi-conformal transformations in lens design. I demonstrate how transformation optics can be used to take a classical lens design based on spherical symmetry, such as a Luneburg lens, and warp it to suit the requirements of a planar imaging array. I report on the experimental demonstration of this lens at microwave frequencies. In the final design a lens is demonstrated in a two-dimensional field mapping waveguide to have a field of view of ~ 140 degrees and a bandwidth exceeding a full decade. In this work I proposed the idea of using the inverse of the quasi-conformal transform to arrive at the <b>lens</b> <b>index</b> profile. I performed all necessary simulations and wrote ray tracing code to confirm the properties of the lens. I proposed the metamaterial realization of the lens and performed the necessary retrievals for material design. I wrote code which would create the layout for an arbitrary gradient index structure in a standard computer aided drafting format. I fabricated three lenses-two of which are described in this thesis-and took all of the data shown in the thesis. The most well known example of a transformation optical device is the invisibility cloak. Despite the great deal of attention paid to the cloak in the literature, the most natural way in which to quantify the efficacy of the cloak-its cross-section-has never been experimentally determined. This measurement is of practical interest because the cloak provides a useful canonical example of a medium which relies on the unique properties of metamaterials-strong anisotropy, inhomogeneity and both magnetic and electric response. Thus, a cloaking cross-section measurement provides a useful way to quantify advancements in the effective medium theories which form the basis for metamaterials. I report on the first such measurements, performed on the original microwave cloaking design. The experiments were carried out in a two-dimensional TE waveguide. Explicit field maps are used to determine the Bessel decomposition of the scattered wave. It is found that the cloak indeed reduces the scattering cross-section of a concealed metal cylinder in a frequency band from 9. 91 to 10. 14 GHz. The maximum cross-section reduction was determined to be 24 %. The total cross-section and the Bessel decomposition of the scattered wave are compared to an analytical model for the cloaking design which assumes a discrete number of loss-less, homogenized cylinders. While the qualitative features of the cloak-a reduced cross-section at the cloaking frequency-are realized, there is significant deviation from the homogenized calculation. These deviations are associated with loss and inaccuracies of the effective-medium-model for metamaterials. In this work I proposed of direct integration of the fields to perform cross-section measurements. I worked out the necessary formulas to determine the coefficients in the Bessel expansion and the resulting scattering cross-section. I mentored an undergraduate student, Dan Gaultney, who scripted the application of the cross-section analysis and took the necessary data. All of the data in this thesis, however, is based on my own implementation of the data analysis. Dissertatio...|$|E

Typical approaches to minimizing this problem are to carefully calibrate <b>lenses,</b> <b>index</b> match fluids, construct experimental setups using flat access ports and, where possible, to use calibration targets placed directly in the flow utilizing lookup tables (LUTs) to digitally correct optical distortions. Ideally, optical diagnostic systems would be auto-calibrating from the data itself thereby eliminating errors due to calibration target inaccuracy and misalignment and errors due to aberrations whose characteristics are poorly suited to LUT based correction. Furthermore, aberrations could be corrected in setups where placement of optical targets is impractical or impossible and aberrations caused by flows that dynamically alter the optical path could be minimized. This paper presents a method of direct aberration auto-correction {{without the need for}} optical targets or a priori knowledge of the optical distortion through a flow. By utilizing multiple perspectives of a diagnostic volume, whether through a single lens using Active Wavefront Sampling (AWS), Rohaly, et. al.
