40|$|AbstractInstallation of {{offshore}} pipelines in the seabed can be efficiently achieved using pipeline ploughs. Increased efficiency may be achievable through incorporating a smaller forecutter {{in advance of}} the main <b>plough</b> <b>share.</b> Currently guidance is limited and conflicting as to the advantages or disadvantages of incorporating a forecutter. To investigate the effect of forecutter inclusion model tests were undertaken at 1 / 50 th scale under laboratory conditions in sand beds prepared at different relative densities in both dry and saturated conditions. Dry sand tests were used to determine the effect of the forecutter on the static or passive components of plough tow force. The currently adopted passive pressure coefficient (Cs) did not appear to vary with relative density to the same degree as previously suggested and the forecutter increased the magnitude of the passive or static resistance to ploughing. Saturated tests were used {{to determine the effects of}} the forecutter on the rate dependant component of ploughing resistance and allow verification of a dimensionless form of rate effect representation. The forecutter acts to reduce the rate effect component of plough tow force in both fine sand (low permeability) and to a lesser extent in medium sand (higher permeability). In fine and silty sands, however, incorporating a forecutter would seem highly beneficial at all ploughing depths and soil densities but in medium sand (higher permeability) the benefits of incorporation are limited to an operating window at shallower trench depths and lower relative density...|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{possible}} soil tillage is {{an important}} part of a sustainable crop production system. Research and practice of reduced tillage was originally started mainly to reduce energy and time consumption related to tillage. However, current research and practice of reduced tillage is also aimed at soil and water conservation as well as reduction of nutrient losses from arable land. Research on reduced tillage in Sweden has been conducted for more than two decades. Reduced tillage comprises different tillage systems, which replace the traditional moldboard ploughing. These also include modem <b>plough</b> <b>shares</b> by which depth of ploughing can be reduced to about 10 cm. This report summarizes investigations of soil physical properties in six long-term experiments with reduced tillage. The experiments were 6 to 24 years old at the time of investigation (in 1997 or 1998). In this study, soil physical properties after minimum tillage and conventional ploughing were compared. Soil physical properties investigated include dry bulk density, soil water content during the vegetation period, infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity, air permeability in the field and laboratory, oxygen content of soil air after continuous or heavy rain, and soil temperature. Soil water content during the vegetation period was measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The dry bulk density in the lower part of the top soil was greater in plots with reduced tillage than in plots with conventional ploughing. Many of the investigated soil physical properties were improved by reduced tillage. Variation of soil water content was smaller for reduced tillage than for conventional ploughing. This shows that drainage and water holding capacity often were improved, particularly in the heavy soils. crop yield in heavy clays has been improved by reduced tillage. In some cases, A decrease in yield was observed during the initial periods of reduced tillage, but the difference has been minimized with time, which can be attributed to the improvement of soil structure. This improvement, however, may be less pronounced in light soils. A well planned transition from conventional ploughing to reduced tillage, such as loosening of old plough pan and minimizing of infestation by perennial weeds, can minimize yield losses...|$|R
40|$|Lost Iron – {{requirement}} {{and consumption}} of iron and steel in agriculture in medieval Sweden This study aims at an estimation {{of the amount of}} iron required for agriculture during the Middle Ages in Sweden. To calculate this we need to know which implements were used, their weights and how they were subjected to wear. Research on wear has been very scarce but it is of great importance to measure how much iron that was needed to replace what was taken away by constant wear, i. e. on <b>shares</b> for <b>ploughs</b> and ards. To achieve this a new method was devised. The method is based on previous research by Grith Lerche, with additional analyses and calculations. The method presented and used is called Wear Calculation Method and consists of five steps. Step 1 : Study of medieval agricultural implements, their shape and weight. Step 2 : Metallurgical analysis of selected implements, to answer questions about materials and how they were processed. Step 3 : Experimental Archaeology: Manufacture of replicas of the implements analyzed in step 2. Step 4 : Experimental Archaeology: ard ploughing and haymaking with replicas of ard shares and scythes for the purpose of measuring wear. Step 5 : Analysis of the wear experiment, results and calculations of consumption of iron and steel in medieval agriculture. The experimental part of the thesis focuses on ard shares and scythes, since the ard and the scythe were the main implements for ploughing and haymaking during the Middle Ages in Sweden. These experiments were carried out during two seasons at Östra Järvafältet, north of Stockholm, Sweden. I have measured wear on the ard shares in grams per kilometer. But more relevant and often more compatible with data from written sources is a measure of how many grams that are worn off per hectare or any other given unit of land. The wear is approximated at 100 grams of iron and steel per ploughed hectare (10 000 m 2), in conditions similar to the situation when the replicas were used. I chose to do my analyses on two different spatial levels, the farm and the county. The results prove that ard ploughing means much heavier wear on the implements compared to haymaking. Generally you needed an annual addition of slightly over 1 kg of iron to plough the fields of a normal-sized farm in Uppland. Thus we may estimate the total amount of iron required in Uppland to replace the wear caused by ploughing to 8, 4 ton a year. These results show that iron and steel production were of great importance for the High Medieval economic expansion and modernization, where increased iron production and consumption as well as simultaneous expansion of arable land were vital. Between {{the end of the first}} millennium and the mid- 14 th century, the population of Sweden approximately doubled in size, much like the rest of Europe. Iron was a most important third factor (in combination with an increased population and the cultivation of new land) in this expanding age, ca AD 1000 – 1300.

40|$|SUMMARY Agricultural {{implement}} draft requirements {{depend on}} forces necessary to compress, shear, displace, accelerate and sometimes pulverize soil. These forces depend on (a) implement operating parameters, (b) soil properties and (c) implement geometry (James et. al., 1996). Experimental and theoretical analyses techniques {{are essential to}} develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. Soil bin, an experimental system, is a generic term for a test facility for studying soil dynamics, specifically for soil-machine interaction research in agriculture (Mahadi, 2005). Considerable experimental analysis has been done using indoor soil bin test systems under controlled soil condition. However, the parameters resulting from controlled soil conditions will not meet the actual field soil conditions. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research is to design and install a portable in-situ soil bin test system, and to use this system for experimentation with six different ploughshare geometries. This will give information on how geommetry and working conditions affect draught and power requirements for soil manipulations under actual field soil conditions. In the experimental design it is foreseen that the experimentation will be undertaken at three plough planes i. e. surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth. At each plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of the ploughshare i. e. 80, 150, and 240 representing primary, secondary, and tertiary tillage. Following experimentation and the signal analysis,, multi linear and linear regression are to be performed tocorrelate draught force with soil physical and mechanical properties, tillage tool geometry, travel speed, tillage depth, tillage angle, and furrow profile. The soil physical and mechanical properties are: bulk density, moisture content, penetration resistance, clay content, and silt content. Deliverables: D 1 : Design and installation of in-situ portable Soil Bin Test System is documented D 2 : Values about Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile of the three planes at three different angles of plough with replicas from three sites at wet and dry conditions are reported Milestone: M 1 : Effect of Moisture Content, Bulk Density, Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile, Soil Compaction, Clay Content, and Silt Content on Draught Requirement is investigated. M 2 : Effect of tool geometry on draught and soil manipulation is investigated INTRODUCTION The term tillage embraces all operations of seedbed preparation that optimize soil and environmental conditions for seed germination, seedling establishment and crop growth (FAO, 1994). The primary objectives of tillage are seedbed preparation, provision of a good medium for plant roots, water infiltration and retention, erosion and weed control (FAO, 1993). Tillage modifies soil surface structure, total porosity, macro-porosity, pore continuity and pore size distribution and therefore has great influence on the hydrology of an agricultural catchments (Mwendera, 1992). A granular structure is desirable to allow rapid infiltration and good retention of rainfall to provide adequate moisture and air exchange capacity within the soil and to minimize resistance to root penetration (Kelemu, 2001). A good seedbed generally implies finer particles and greater firmness {{in the vicinity of the}} seeds. However, the mechanical manipulation of soil (Kaumbutho et al., 2004) should be done carefully and adequately; otherwise, it leads to extreme soil disturbance, which in turn results in deteriorative consequences. The new tillage systems and the need for improved energy efficiency of tillage operations do put an emphasis for optimizing tillage tool design. This can be done by two different techniques, namely by experiment and by theoretical analysis techniques (Plouffe et al., 1999 a & b; Mouazen and Neményi, 1998). These methodologies could significantly assist in optimizing the implement designs and operational conditions aiming at minimum draught requirement and best soil manipulation performance. Soil bin test system technique is a means of experimental verification essential to develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. The requirement of such efficient tillage technique is to consume less energy and provide a satisfactory soil condition for crop emergence and growth. The field experiment allows prototype verification with specialized instrumented equipment (McLaughlin et al., 1993). Various researchers studied the draught requirement with respect to different soil and tillage parameters (Gill and Vanden Berg, 1967; Eradat Oskoui et. al 1982; Ayers and Perumpral, 1982; Koolen and Kuipers, 1983; Kydd et al., 1984; Upadhyaya et al. 1984; Busscher and Sojka, 1987; Young et al. 1988; Mouazen and Ramon, 2002; Bernier et al., 1989; Erbach et al., 1992; Oni et al., 1992; Shirin et al., 1993; Evans et al., 1996; Fielke, 1996; McKyes and Maswaure, 1997; Onwualu and Watts, 1998; Al-Janobi and Al-Suhaibani, 1998; Mapfumo and Chanasyk, 1998; Unger and Jones, 1998; Manian et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2001; Gratton et al., 2003; McLaughlin and Campbell, 2004). Although several reports on the effects of draught on the performances of different tillage tools and implements are available in the literature, there is dearth of information on experimentation of maresha plough with soil bin test system. Hence, the aim of this research is thesis aims to: (i) review research attempts on animal drawn implements; and soil bin test systems, techniques, and applications; (ii) describe the development of a mobile in-situ soil bin testing device; (iii) report the observations and insights gained from the field experiments; (iv) investigate the effect of maresha plough geometry on draught requirement and soil loosening; and (v) lay platform for further research. To do this, the design and installation of a portable and in-situ soil bin test system allows for controlled experimentation under field conditions. 1. 1 Why portable and in-situ soil bin test system Indoor soil bins provide tremendous benefits to researchers. But there are limitations with indoor soil bin test systems i. e. Indoor soil bins are built under dimensional constraints. Indoor soil bins have a limit in maximum loads. Most indoor soil bins are in a closed confinement. Replicate measurements on indoor bins always occur on disturbed and artificially conditioned soil Indoor soil bin does not consider the existence of vegetation and crop residue that affect the actual performance which cannot be replicated in an indoor soil bin. MATERIALS AND METHODS The portable and in-situ soil bin test system is designed and implemented by integrating measurement system (sensors, and data acquisition system). Draught is to be measured using force sensors (load cells), and online measurement of tillage speed and tillage depth using encoders and LVDT. Using core samplers, soil samples will be taken from field at 2 m interval, and accordingly bulk density, moisture content, clay content, and silt content are to be determined in laboratory. Soil penetration mesaurements are also done at these locations. Experimental Design The experimental design of in-situ and portable soil bin test sytem will consider six geometries: maresha without wing, maresha with wing, tenkara kind, duck foot plough, two modified plough geometries (modified plough 1, modified plough 2). Experiments will be undertaken at three planes to gain information of effect of soil compaction layers: surface ploughing, ploughing at 20 cm depth, ploughing at 40 cm depth. At each plough plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of ploughing/attack i. e. 80, 150, and 240 for the respective geometries. The soil bin consists of a carriage on which the instruments and <b>plough</b> <b>shares</b> are mounted. The carriage itself moves on an adapted rail track. The rail has 20 m length, and at both ends 2 m length is excavated to 60 cm depth for the start and end of a test run. This yields 16 m effective ploughing length and accordingly the starting and ending of ploughing is defined. The online parameters to be measured are draft force, tillage depth, and speed. At 2 m interval, soil samples will be taken to determine bulk density and moisture content in the laboratory. Penetration resistance and furrow areas and shapes will be measured at same distance interval. Tests in the dry season allow for controlled moisture conditioning of the soil: the soil shall get wet using partition dams with water application of 100 lt/m 2, and to be covered with plastic for three days. Two experimental designs which will be applicable at three sites with different soil types are proposed and are under review. 2. 2 Design and establishment of portable and in-stiu Soil Bin Test System Design and construction of rail and carriage system: The portable soil bin test system is designed and the components are pair of rails having 20 m length, carriage, and treated wooden footings. For experimental purpose, three rows are established, and the schematic layout is presented below. Design of sensor attachments: Design of measurement system for portable soil bin test system is performed. The soil bin test system incorporates load cell attachments for surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth ploughings. The load cells are connected by a cable to a data logger; and data presentation is displayed by means of PC running data acquisition system and DasyLab software package. Analog to Digital conversion System: The computer-based instrument acquires data in a rather straightforward system. A load cell picks up the force deformation and this analog information is received by the data acquisition hardware and digitized. The digitized value is sent to the computer and received by the data acquisition software. The software then interprets the value, conditions, scales, and displays and stores the data. The data acquisition hardware is from IOtech and composed of DBK 43 A (8 -channel strain gage module), DagBook/ 2000 E (Ethernet 16 -bit, 200 -kHz data acquisition system; includes DaqView software), DBK 203 (Screw-terminal adapter board in rugged metal enclosure for DaqBoard/ 2000 series; P 1 /P 2 /P 3, analog and digital I/O expansion ports), DBK 34 A (uninterruptible Power Supply for DC powered systems), and CA- 37 - 3 T (expansion cable from DaqBook to DBK modules). A software program called DASYLab, windows-based graphical data acquisition software package, is usede for data acquisition. The DASYLab uses icon-based flowchart, the job of communicating with the hardware is taken care of by a driver. Data Analyses: After suitable filtering to remove measurement noise, the force and speed signals are available for analysis. Multi linear and linear regression are to be performed to correlate draught force with moisture content, bulk density, tillage depth, tillage angle, travel speed, penetration resistance, furrow profile, clay content, and silt content. 3 Ph. D. STATUS The doctoral research is based on experimentation using portable and in-situ soil bin test system, and instrumentation of two-wheel tractor. Literature review has been undertaken, and the in-situ and portable soil bin test system is designed and installed in Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Attachement which helps to plough at three planes i. e. surface, 20 cm depth, and 40 cm are designed, manufactured and tested. Experimentation was undertaken at three plough planes: surface, at 20 cm depth, and 40 cm depth; and at three different angle of plough. The respective depths are prepared by removing strip of 40 cm width soil so as to investigate the effect of hardpan on soil tillage. Soil samples were also taken at 2 m interval using core samplers to determine moisture content and bulk density. Preliminary data analyses were also undertaken. The progress of the work was presented on seminar held on Nov 17, 2010 at KU Leuven. The following points were raised: experimental design with randomization; changing the pulling rope with steel chain because of elasticity; and topography of the selected plot which need to be plain enough, and start of ploughing somehow from relatively bottom so that to avoid inertia effect of the carriage. Besides, instead of measuring tillage depth manually and caluclating speed as function of total distance travelled and time elapsed, it is recommended to incorprate encoder and LVDT so that to have online data measurement. With regard to wheel slip, two encoders recommended to be incorporated on the design, one to be attached at the drive wheel and the other one at the free wheel. In order to avoid noise on measurement, grounding the -ve of battery, and sheilding of all cables with aluminium foil and grounding to the same point was recommended; with this, data was taken and displayed data was seen with lesser noise. For further data measurement and signal analyses, it is recommended to design filter in order to avoid noise on measrement, and the process is on progress. Experimental design and daily basis work plan is submitted and it is on review. From Feb 2011 to Sep 2011, in Mekelle University - Ethiopia, the measurement system will be modified to incorporate the above mentioned recommendations and intensive data will be taken from three sites. Data analyses and interpretation will then follow from Oct 2011 up to Mar 2012 at KU Leuven. status: accepte...|$|R
