25|$|Many DRM systems require {{authentication}} with {{an online}} server. Whenever the server goes down, or a region or country experiences an Internet outage, it effectively <b>locks</b> <b>out</b> people from registering or using the material. This {{is especially true}} for a product that requires a persistent online authentication, where, for example, a successful DDoS attack on the server would essentially make all copies of the material unusable.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Hindenburg-lock (in Hannover, Germany, built 1919–1928) has two lock {{chambers}} of 225 m length, {{each of which}} would use 42,000 m³ of water for a full locking cycle. Due {{to the use of}} 10 water saving basins, only 10,500 m³ of water are used. A more recent example is the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal with 13 saving <b>locks</b> <b>out</b> of a total of 16 locks.|$|E

This version of the game allows access to the first two areas of the dungeon, and <b>locks</b> <b>out</b> {{two of the three}} playable classes and many of the NPC townsfolk. It is playable in both single- and multi-player with those restrictions. The demo is also downloadable.|$|E

50|$|In Q3, Sebastian Vettel secured pole {{position}} {{with a time}} of 1:16.276.

25|$|Similar to Atlantis, the Destiny has a {{built-in}} dialing computer which can automatically dial the gate and stores a list of addresses. It <b>locks</b> <b>out</b> certain addresses, presumably because they are either dangerous or inconsequential to the current problem. Two expedition members who {{went to one of}} the locked-out addresses could not be contacted upon redialing. The Destiny also has hand-held dialing computers for those that travel through the Gate to make use of, as there {{do not appear to be}} on-site DHDs thus far. Gates on planets are each equipped with a platform, which transmits information about planet through subspace to Destiny. Since DHDs are absent, it is presumed the platforms are used to power the Gates.|$|E

Ferengi pirates board the ship and take control, but Riker <b>locks</b> <b>out</b> the main computer. The Ferengi beam most of the adults on board to a nearby planet and corral the children, including Picard and his party, into the schoolrooms on board. Picard and his group try to use the classroom computers {{to regain control of}} the ship, but are prevented by the limited functionality and condescending interface. Picard pretends to be Riker's son and demands the Ferengi take him to his [...] "father," [...] throwing a tantrum until his demand is met. He asks Riker to unlock the computer console in the schoolroom, using the ruse that none of the computer games will work.|$|E

2500|$|When any {{of these}} sensors is activated, the game {{registers}} a [...] "tilt" [...] and <b>locks</b> <b>out,</b> disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end {{the ball in play}} on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a [...] "slam tilt" [...] switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Luke {{revealed}} in February 2011 that a final track listing {{had not yet}} been chosen. Later that month, Spears worked with will.i.am. Spears later commented that she is a fan of The Black Eyed Peas, and would love to work with will.i.am again the future. She also said that she discovered Sabi through a friend recommendation, and had always wanted to feature a new artist in one of her albums, hence they recorded [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful". British producer Fraser T Smith worked with Spears on three tracks and complimented her work ethic, saying that her voice was powerful and that she focused on the music. William Orbit confirmed he had co-written a track for Spears with Klas Åhlund, but it was left off the final track listing. Orbit stated that he was displeased with the decision, and commented, [...] "he Britney thing. Look, I went to a writing camp at Teresa's. Had lovely time. Word got out. Assumptions were made.
