25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. But then when the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t think much of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How I <b>Learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> <b>with</b> the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the {{historical}} figure of the same name, is Bolívar's [...] "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's [...] "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, [...] Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.|$|E

2500|$|He {{stressed}} {{that he had}} come to abolish Kali Yukam [...] and to usher in an age of Dharma Yukam, when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’ was a constant refrain in his teachings. People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of Kali by transforming themselves to be 'people of Dharma Yukam' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said, [...] ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ [...] [...] He said when people grew out of kalimayai, Dharma Yukam would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as Dharma Raja, the king of Dharma Yukam.|$|E
2500|$|In 1532, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán {{entered the}} Sierra Gorda and conquered it {{but did not}} hold it. From that time until the 18th century, {{there had been a}} number of {{missions}} established by the Franciscans and the Augustinians, but these missions were either destroyed by the Chichimecas or the population would flee from them and move into more inaccessible mountains and canyons. The first Spanish population in the Arroyo Seco area was in San Nicolás Concá, established as an encomienda under Pedro Guzmán between 1533 and 1538. This territory extended over much of the Sierra Gorda and into what is now San Luis Potosí. In 1587, Concá and Jalpan had missions established in them by the Augustinians from Xilitla. [...] In 1601, friar Lucas de los Ángeles from the Xichú monastery preached in the area with limited success. In 1609, viceroy Luis de Velasco ordered that the Franciscans leave missionary work to the Augustinians, including the Arroyo Seco area. However, Franciscans from Michoacán stayed and worked with the Augustinians. Those who lasted longest in the area were those who learned the Pame language and <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> Pame customs.|$|E

2500|$|Chester's {{character}} had no surname until Baer ad libbed [...] "Proudfoot" [...] {{during an}} early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by [...] "Townsman". Again, Conrad's {{sense of what}} the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as [...] "W" [...] in the June 15, 1958 episode [...] "Old Flame", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode [...] "Marshal Proudfoot", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's [...] "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode [...] "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode [...] "Hank Prine" [...] (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his [...] "deputy" [...] stating [...] "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch - McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the limp and virtually forget it.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze and describe the phenomenon of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> long-term illness. Method: The design and implementation of the research was based on a reflective lifeworld approach. The study consisted of interviews <b>with</b> people who <b>live</b> <b>with</b> different types of long-term illness. Results: <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> a long-term illness happens in such a way as to respond to the will <b>to</b> <b>live</b> everyday life. The essential meaning of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> long-term illness is constituted by the following elements: <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> know and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> a stranger, the driving forces of learning, learning methods are a balancing act, making the illness visible, as well as seeking knowledge and understanding. The result of the learning process can be understood as movement to a new understanding that is shown in the way the person with the illness acts and gives herself with the illness more space in life. Conclusion: The results show that genuine learning is something that differs from learning information and that the learning must be supported by the sufferer’s situation for a long period of time at an existential level...|$|R
