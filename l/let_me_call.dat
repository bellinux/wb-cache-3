500|$|The {{rights to}} Buddha and its {{associated}} recordings were {{the subject of a}} legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. According to Secor, he and the band had a gentleman's agreement: he would pay for the costs of recording and manufacturing the tape, and in exchange would receive half of all the profits from it. Raynor contends that the oral agreement was that Secor would invest $1,000 and when that money was recouped, the band would have complete ownership of the work product. Secor helped the band sign to Cargo Music in 1994, as he had connections at the label; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label, Filter, in the wake of Blink's success. According to Secor, he attempted to contact the band to discuss the rights to the tape, but would only receive comments such as [...] "Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>call</b> my manager and I'll call you right back." [...] Secor asserted he should have the rights to the master tapes, as he financed the entire production. Cargo Music began calling and making threats, and Secor had no money to fight back with, as they had no written contract. In 1996, the band signed a joint-venture deal with major label MCA Records, who also began making calls to Secor. [...] "Try going up against that," [...] Secor remarked in 2001.|$|E
