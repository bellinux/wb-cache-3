500|$|At 04:44 on 14 October 1942, in {{very bad}} weather, Irish Oak {{received}} a distress call from British ship Stornest, a straggler from convoy ONS 136, torpedoed by [...] Irish Oak answered {{the call and}} altered course. Six minutes later Stornest radioed Irish Oak that they were abandoning ship in <b>life-rafts,</b> having lost their lifeboats in the heavy seas. Irish Oak continued to relay Stormests SOS and spent ten hours searching for survivors in a westerly gale. The rescue tug Adherent, the anti-submarine trawler Drangey and two corvettes from convoy ONS 137 joined the search, to no avail. Stornest's crew of 29 and ten gunners were lost at sea.|$|E
500|$|Five of the convoy's {{surviving}} merchant ships reached Gibraltar; 10 {{retreated to}} neutral Portugal. This {{was described as}} [...] "a bitter act of surrender could ever come our way". In Lisbon Lanahrones crew went on strike, which was resolved with extra <b>life-rafts</b> and pay. The crew of Irish Poplar was waiting in Lisbon; when the remnants of OG 71 limped in. The crew of Irish Poplar resolved to sail home alone. While City of Dublin brought Clonlaras survivors to Cork, Lanahrone joined Convoy HG 73. Nine of the 25 ships in that convoy were lost. These experiences and {{the inability of the}} Royal Navy to protect merchant ships had a most profound effect on all Irish Ships. Thereafter they were blacked out when sailing in Allied convoys. Ship-owners, on the advice of their masters, decided not to sail their vessels in British convoys and by the early months of 1942 the practice had ceased.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant Brown {{was left}} {{stranded}} with 18 {{of his men}} and five of the Wellington men. He set the men to constructing <b>life-rafts.</b> The bow continued settling. The radio operator was in contact with Warrington and continued sending position reports. Rockets were fired from Wellington, and at 14:30 on the 17th answering rockets from Warrington were seen off the port bow. Wellington listed rapidly and Lieutenant Brown gave the order to abandon ship. He continued signaling with a hand flashlight to Warrington about [...] away as the ship's keel turned to a sixty degree angle. Then her boilers exploded and the vessel rose up for her final plunge. Lieutenant Brown jumped and swam clear, searching about for something to which he could cling.|$|E

2500|$|USN Patrol Torpedo Boats (PTs) {{were based}} at Funafuti from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944. Squadron 1B arrived on 2 November 1942 with [...] as the support ship, which {{remained}} until 25 November 1942. On 22 December 1942 Squadron 3 Division 2 (including PTs 21, 22, 25 & 26) arrived with the combined squadron commanded by LT Jonathan Rice. In July 1943 Squadron 11-2 (including PTs 177, 182, 185, and 186) {{under the command}} of LT John H. Stillman relieved Squadron 3-2. The PT Boats operated from Funafuti against Japanese shipping in the Gilbert Islands; although they were primarily involved in patrol and rescue duty. A Kingfisher float plane rescued Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and aircrew from <b>life-rafts</b> near Nukufetau, with PT 26 from Funafuti completing the rescue. Motor Torpedo Boat operations ceased at Funafuti in May 1944 and Squadron 11-2 was transferred to Emirau Island, New Guinea.|$|E
2500|$|This {{contrasted with}} Olympic and [...] which {{received}} a {{full complement of}} lifeboats all rigged under davits. This difference would have been a major contributor to the high loss of life involved with Lusitanias sinking, since there was not sufficient time to assemble collapsible boats or <b>life-rafts,</b> {{had it not been for}} the fact that the ship's severe listing made it impossible for lifeboats on the port side of the vessel to be lowered, and the rapidity of the sinking did not allow the remaining lifeboats that could be directly lowered (as these were rigged under davits) to be filled and launched with passengers. When Britannic, working as a hospital ship during World War I, sank in 1916 after hitting a mine in the Kea channel the already davited boats were swiftly lowered saving nearly all on board, but the ship took nearly three times as long to sink as Lusitania and thus the crew had more time to evacuate passengers.|$|E
2500|$|October 22, 1962—A DC-7 with 7 {{crew and}} 95 {{passengers}} made a successful water landing in Sitka Sound. The military charter flight {{was en route}} to Elmendorf Air Force Base from McChord Air Force Base and, prior to the ditching at just before 1 p.m. local time, the crew had been struggling with a propeller problem for about 45 minutes. The plane stayed afloat for 24 minutes after coming {{to rest in the}} water, giving the occupants ample time to evacuate into <b>life-rafts.</b> Only 6 minor injuries were reported; all passengers and crew were quickly rescued by U.S. Coast Guard ships. The accident report called the ditching [...] "an outstanding feat," [...] citing several key factors in this water landing's success: pilots' skill, ideal conditions (calm seas, favorable weather, daylight), time to prepare for the ditching and the military passengers' ease with following orders. Pilots who flew over the scene also praised the Northwest crew, calling it the [...] "...finest ditching they had ever seen..." [...]|$|E

Following the final incursion, Black Swan and the Cabal awoke in their <b>life-raft</b> when it landed on the patchwork planet called Battleworld. While Black Swan and the Cabal were fighting the Thor Corps, Sheriff Strange released the survivors of Earth-616 from their <b>life-raft</b> in hopes that they would confront the Cabal. Upon being teleported to Doomgard by Sheriff Strange, Black Swan was confronted by God Emperor Doom and ended up serving him. Black Swan was with God Emperor Doom's family when it came to the battle between Battleworld's inhabitants and God Emperor Doom's forces. When Black Swan confronted Star-Lord near the World Tree and defeated him, she was caught by surprise when Star-Lord managed to turn the World Tree into Groot, who defeated her.|$|R
