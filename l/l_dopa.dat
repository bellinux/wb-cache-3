40|$|Small cell {{lung cancer}} growing in cell culture {{possesses}} biologic properties that allow classification into two categories: classic and variant. Compared with classic small cell lung cancer cell lines, variant lines have altered large cell morphology, shorter doubling times, higher cloning efficiencies in soft agarose, and very {{low levels of}} <b>L</b> <b>dopa</b> decarboxylase production and bombesin-like immunoreactivity. C-myc is amplified and expressed in some small cell lung cancer cell lines and all c-myc amplified lines studied to date display the variant phenotype. To investigate if c-myc amplification and expression {{is responsible for the}} variant phenotype, a normal human c-myc gene was transfected into a cloned classic small cell lung cancer cell line not amplified for or expressing detectable c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA). Clones were isolated with one to six copies of c-myc stably integrated into DNA that expressed c-myc mRNA. In addition, one clone with an integrated neo gene but a deleted c-myc gene was isolated and in this case c-myc was not expressed. C-myc expression in transfected clones was associated with altered large cell morphology, a shorter doubling time, and increased cloning efficiency, but no difference in <b>L</b> <b>dopa</b> decarboxylase levels and bombesin-like immunoreactivity. We conclude increased c-myc expression observed here in transfected clones correlates with some of the phenotypic properties distinguishing c-myc amplified variants from unamplified classic small cell lung cancer lines...|$|E

40|$|There is {{compelling}} evidence to implicate dopamine in {{the etiology of}} obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Administration of amphetamine (Ellinwood, 1967) phenmetrazine and <b>L</b> <b>dopa</b> produces obsessive symptoms. Furthermore, a recent study indicated in Tourette's syndrome patients, fluvoxamine worsened tics, coprolalia and OCD but the addition of pimozide improved both OCD and tics (McDougle et al., 1990). Patients with tic spectrum disorder and premorbid schizoid personality responded to this drug. Pimozide alone improved tics and not OCD (Delgado et al., 1990). These findings indicate that a hyperdopaminergic state as well as serotonin mechanism {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis in OCD. Contrary to the above mentioned findings, patients with parkinson's disease, encephalitis lethargica or Sydenham's chorea manifest OCD, indicating that a deficency of dopamine may be involved in its pathogenesis. In fact, Insel et al. (1983) reported a significant improvement in OCD patients treated with amphetamine. Therefore there is evidence for both dopamine excess and deficiency in OCD. We used a dopamine release inhibitor-cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) and a dopaminergic drug- methylphenidate in OCD patients to assess their efficacy in the management of this disorder...|$|E
40|$|KCN- 1 {{is known}} to reduce tumor growth 6 -fold in mice {{implanted}} with LN 229 glioma cells. Although this inhibitor is effective, the mechanism of action for KCN- 1 is not well understood. Based on preliminary studies, KCN- 1 reduces tumor growth by disrupting the HIF 1 (hypoxia-induced factor- 1) pathway. The binding target of KCN- 1 needs to be investigated {{in order to develop}} KCN- 1 or its analogs for therapeutic applications. In this research, a molecule was designed and synthesized for the identification of the binding target of KCN- 1. Specifically, this molecule contains the inhibitor (KCN- 1), a photocleavable linker, beads, and the affinity label (<b>L</b> <b>DOPA).</b> When UV light shines on the linker, the trans-alkene isomerizes to cis-alkene and undergoes intramolecular ring-closing reaction, which helps cleave the immobilized bead from the linker. The immobilized bead is used to separate the binding fragment attached to the photocleavable linker from the solution after enzyme digestion. The affinity label (L-DOPA) reacts with a nucleophile from the binding target and creates a covalent bond. If the design is successful, this method is able to analyze the mass of the peptide sequence and determine the binding target of KCN- 1...|$|E

Objective : To indentify and to quantify the speech prosody impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) Methods : 10 PD male patients (mean age : 57 y, mean disease duration : 9 y) were compared with 10 male controls (mean age : 59 y). AII subjects, after informed consent, were recorded during a loud voice reading task of a text (1 mn duration) with an acoustic system (EVA 2, SQ-lab, France). The PD patients were in OFF <b>L.</b> <b>DOPA</b> status (overnight washout > 12 hours). The distribution of tonal and intensity ranges (with mean fundamental frequency Fo in Hz and mean intensity in dB) were calculated, using the melodic tonal and intensity curves. The distribution and duration of silent pauses and the duration of vowels and consonants were also measured systematically from the acoustic signal. Statistical comparisons were made between PD patients and control sujects (paired Student's t test : significance at p Results : A significant reduction in mean Fo and in mean intensity was observed in PD patients, with lack of {{the upper part of}} the tonal range, thus resulting also in the reduction of variability in pitch and intensity. The silent pauses duration and the mean vowel duration were significantly increased in PD patients, whereas the mean consonant duration was decreased in PD patients. Conclusion : This acoustic approach can provide an objective and quantitative assessment of the speech dysprosody in Parkinson's disease, thus completing the classical perceptual assessment more focused on the articulatory disorders.

40|$|Dystonia, one of {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorders, is characterized by involuntary muscle cocontractions, causing repetitive twisting movements. The early-onset torsion dystonia can be identified by a mutation of the DYT 1 gene and represents the most common hereditary type of dystonia (Schmidt et al., 2008). This type of dystonia usually occurs between the 5 th and the 28 th year of age, has a penetrance of only 30 - 40 % in gene carriers and tends to generalize (Bandmann und Müler, 2002; Bressman, 2006). After the detection of the mutation, different mouse lines which carry the human gene defect are recommended as models for the early-onset torsion dystonia (Grundmann et al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2005; Shashidharan et al., 2005). However, characterization of these models is based on only few analyses so far. The “face validity” (comparable symptoms in model and patient) is an important criterion for the use of a model in the preclinical drug research. Initial descriptions by Shashidharan et al. (2005) led to the assumption that their transgenic mouse model shows “dystonic-like” postures. Therefore, we chose this mouse model for further characterization in this study. For this purpose, we firstly investigated untreated DYT 1 mice with different tests for the evaluation of the motor activity and fear behavior. These investigations were done at different ages to recognize a possible progression of the disease and for a better prediction of the “face validity”. Contrary to the initial descriptions by Shashidharan et al. (2005) the results of these studies revealed that this mouse model does not exhibit a clear dystonic phenotype. The results from DYT 1 patients as well as the findings from previous studies in DYT 1 mice and knowledge about the function of the protein TorsinA indicate that the dopaminergic system plays a critical role for the occurrence of DYT 1 dystonia (Shashidharan et al., 2005; Wichmann, 2008). In order to determine the possible functional role of dopaminergic dysfunctions in DYT 1 mice, different dopaminergic drugs were acutely applicated intraperitoneally. Thereby, attention was paid to an exacerbation respectively an improvement of the “dystonic-like” postures initially described by Shashidharan et al. (2005). By the application of the dopamine-precursor L-DOPA at a dosage of 100 mg/kg in combination with the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa (10 mg/kg) and of the dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12935 at a dosage of 15 mg/kg at different ages, it was investigated if age-dependent differences in the side effects of these compounds respectively in the “dystonic-like” postures occur. For this purpose, we used several behavioral tests and additionally we established a score-system for the evaluation of “dystonic-like” postures to firstly quantify these postures and movements. Since age-related differences could not be observed in these investigations, the effects of 25 mg/kg <b>L</b> <b>DOPA,</b> of 45 mg/kg GBR 12935, of 5 and 10 mg/kg amphetamine (to increase the dopamine turnover), of 1 and 2 mg/kg of the selective D 1 -agonist A 68930, of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg/kg of the selective D 1 -antagonist SCH 39166, of 1 and 5 mg/kg of the selective D 2 -agonist quinpirole as well as 0. 5 and 3 mg/kg of the selective D 2 -antagonist raclopride were only evaluated at an age of 6 month by using a score-system. These acute applications of different dopaminergic substances did not reveal abnormal reactions in DYT 1 mice in comparison to control mice and thus, did not indicate a functional relevance of a dopaminergic dysfunction in DYT 1 mice. Therefore, it was determined if possible changes of the “dystonic-like” movements and postures could be provoked by chronic manipulations of the dopaminergic system. Consequently, L-DOPA was given at a dose of 25 mg/kg in combination with 10 mg/kg carbidopa i. p. once a day over a period of 20 days. In contrast to the acute application, L-DOPA enhanced the severity of "dystonic-like" movements in transgenic mice but not in L-DOPA treated control animals. This finding indicates that malfunction of the dopaminergic system is involved in this mouse model. As shown by the results, the here examined DYT 1 mouse model shows no „face validity”. Therefore this transgenic line is not suitable for the preclinical drug research. Nevertheless, this mouse model could probably give useful insights into the pathophysiology of the disease. This model can be helpful to identify trigger mechanisms for the manifestation of the disease...|$|E
