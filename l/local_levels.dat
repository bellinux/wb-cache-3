In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office.

Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women.

5|$|The House of Lancaster was {{the name}} of two cadet {{branches}} of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267.

Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the <b>local</b> <b>level.</b> Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control” and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that <b>local</b> <b>level</b> governance encompasses. <b>Local</b> <b>level</b> governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. <b>Local</b> <b>level</b> governance is extremely important even on a global scale.
