5|$|The Lancasters' {{flight to}} Yagodnik {{initially}} went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew {{north to the}} Shetlands before turning east.

Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet anti-aircraft defences, but only one suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} eight tracks and four island platforms. According to the New York City Transit Authority, {{this makes it}} one of the world's largest {{elevated}} transportation terminals, as well as the largest in North America. The westernmost tracks, tracks 5–8, gradually slope downward, so tracks 1–4 are slightly higher than tracks 5–8 at the station's south end. There are ADA-compliant ramps from the three easternmost platforms (the Culver, Brighton, and Sea Beach Lines' platforms, respectively) to the main station building below the platforms; a non-ADA-compliant ramp leads from the West End Line (eastern) platform, with steps. An ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the West End Line platform leads to an overpass that connects to another ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the Sea Beach Line's platform. There are also stairways down to the station building.

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
