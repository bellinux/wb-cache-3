40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a replication of a segment of previous research in which <b>level</b> of emotional <b>attachment</b> to former spouse was measured, and relationships of that measurement to particular variables were explored. The hypotheses are based on characteristics expected to be related to attachment in the context of marital separation and divorce. The data reveal that neither length of marriage nor length of time since physical separation bears a relationship to <b>level</b> of <b>attachment.</b> There is no difference in <b>levels</b> of <b>attachment</b> for males and females. <b>Level</b> of <b>attachment</b> is higher for those individuals who wanted the divorce less than for those who wanted the divorce more. Both expectedness of the divorce and preparedness for the consequences of divorce are related negatively to <b>level</b> of <b>attachment...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> {{security}} that a father had {{with his parents}} {{when he was a}} child may influence his own child’s attachment security in the sense that his child may end up having a similar <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> security. However, this effect is most likely to occur when the father has sole custody of his child. The father’s <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> security in his adult relationships may also have an indirect effect on the child-father attachment. This is because fathers who have a secure attachment style in adult relationships tend to have lower levels of parenting stress, lower levels of abuse potential, and a greater amount of knowledge about child development. Lower levels of parenting stress particularly have been found to be correlated with higher <b>levels</b> of <b>attachment</b> security in the father-child attachment relationship.|$|R

40|$|According to the {{attachment}} theory (Bowbly, 1969) <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> {{of a child}} to his/her caregivers influences the psychological and biological systems that impact the stress regulation. In order {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of stress regulation this study explores the relationship between <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> and stress regulation. This has not been examined yet controlled by age and gender. A total of 105 participants participated in this study. Of the participants were 63 % female and 37 % male, the mean age was 27. 40 ranging from 18 to 62 years. The short version of the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) questionnaire was used to examine <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> (Buist, Dekovic, Meeus & van Aken, 2004). Stressregulation was measured by the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2007). This study showed a significant relationship between <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> and stress regulation on three of the subscales of stress regulation. Also a significant relationship between gender and stress regulation was found on three of the subscales of stress regulation. No significant relationship between gender and <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> was found. A significant relationship between age and stressregulation was found on five of the subscales of stressregulation. There was no evidence found for the existence of a moderation model where stress moderates the relationship between <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> and stress regulation...|$|R

40|$|Cat {{owners and}} volunteers from a rehoming centre {{were given the}} Lexington Attachment to Pet Scale (LAPS) {{questionnaire}} to assess their <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> to their own or rescue cats. In addition, heart rate and blood pressure were measured 10 minutes before, during, and after spending time with the cats. Consistent with other studies, the results here show that spending time with a cat can reduce heart rate and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and that this reduction is generally more pronounced in the cats’ owners rather than in volunteers from a cat rehoming centre. For owners, <b>levels</b> of <b>attachment</b> {{as measured by the}} LAPS scale were positively associated with this reduction in metabolic measurements before and during pet presence; i. e. the difference (B-D) was positively correlated with the <b>level</b> of <b>attachment.</b> This was not observed for volunteers. Interestingly, however, reported <b>levels</b> of <b>attachment</b> were not significantly different between owners and volunteers. For owners, duration of ownership had a positive effect on the <b>level</b> of <b>attachment</b> reported and this effect increased sharply after two plus years of ownership. This contribution to Human Animal Interaction (HAI) research suggests that attachment {{is an important factor in}} promoting health benefits to owners...|$|R
50|$|Attachment {{and health}} {{interact}} on multiple <b>levels.</b> <b>Attachment</b> is a biologically based system tied to {{our response to}} distress and attachment styles appear to confer differences in stress physiology. Illness and pain themselves act as an “activating signal” for attachment systems, and health care providers act as attachment figures in their role addressing illness and pain. Accordingly, attachment styles influence patient perception of illness, health care utilization, medication compliance and treatment response.|$|R

40|$|In female addicts, {{pregnancy}} carries {{risks associated}} with lifestyles, modes of consumption and effect of drugs on the developing fetus. This investigation tried to determine the <b>level</b> of antenatal <b>attachment</b> in pregnant addicts, as well as assess {{the relationship between the}} number of nursing visits and held attendance of the preparation for childbirth, with the <b>level</b> of prenatal <b>attachment.</b> We conducted a correlational study (Fortin, 2009), applied to a single point. Regarding the <b>level</b> of prenatal <b>attachment,</b> and considering that the maximum value for scale is 80, pregnant drug users have an average of 53. 53 (SD= 24. 10), a value above the average value of the scale, it emphasizes that these pregnant have a value of linking prenatal satisfactory. It was found that the greater the number of nurse consultations conducted surveillance of the pregnancy, the greater the <b>level</b> of prenatal <b>attachment,</b> noting also that pregnant addicts who attend the course in preparation for childbirth, have higher levels of binding prenatal care (p < 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{discusses}} sources for, problems in, {{and ways}} of forming a hierarchical model {{of the development of}} whole affective behavioral complexes, not just mechanisms of emotional regulation, as was done in the original level-based model elaborated by Victor Lebedinsky. The author describes specific traits of affective behavioral complexes and types of links between them on different levels. Primitive affective behavioral complexes, either isolated or rigidly linked, dominate on the lower three levels. On the fourth <b>level</b> <b>attachment</b> behavior plays a “star” role, mediating and regulating all vital behaviors. On the fifth level symbolic activity permanently rebuilds the experience obtained on the lower levels. The author discusses links between affective behavioral complexes and nuclear personality formations...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} is made to evaluate factors that influence probing depth and <b>attachment</b> <b>level</b> on the distal aspect of the lower second molar (L 2 M) following extraction of a lower third molar (L 3 M). The PubMed database was searched for studies published between 1997 and March 2009 using the following keywords: mandibular third molar, distal periodontal defect, distal probing depth, distal <b>attachment</b> <b>level,</b> flap design. Randomized prospective studies, with a minimum follow-up of three months for which the full text could be obtained, and that indicated the <b>attachment</b> <b>level</b> and/or probing depth on the distal surface of the L 2 M in both the preoperative and postoperative periods were included. In the studies obtained, flap design had no influence on distal probing depth or distal <b>attachment</b> <b>level</b> of the L 2 M following extraction of an L 3 M. Curettage of the distal radicular surface of the L 2 M, together with oral hygiene control by the dentist, reduced probing depth values. Various authors recommend bone regeneration techniques in patients with a distal periodontal defect prior to extraction. The placing of membranes (resorbable or nonresorbable) is not justified; however, the use of demineralized bone powder or platelet-rich plasma gel reduces the distal probing depth and <b>attachment</b> <b>level</b> of the L 2 M...|$|R
