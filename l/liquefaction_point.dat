's paper “The {{response}} of stromatolites to seismic shocks: Tomboliths from the Palaeoproterozoic Chaibasa Formation, E India” {{with a new}} term “tomboliths” and original viewpoints should be published, but some contents need to be discussed. Shanmugam's paper “The {{response of}} stromatolites to seismic shocks: Tomboliths from the Palaeoproterozoic Chaibasa Formation, E India: Discussion and <b>liquefaction</b> basics” <b>pointed</b> out some queries and problems about Van Loon et al.

However, some main problems, {{such as the new}} term “tomboliths” and its origin of seismic shocks, “whether stromatolites or tomboliths are soft-sediment deformation structures or not”, etc., also need to be discussed. Academic discussion is an effective measure to promote scientific development. The more thorough academic discussions are carried out regarding academic problems, the more scientific facts and truths will become clear. All participants in this discussion are contributors.

40|$|Tailing dams are {{characterized}} by a wide surface exposed to interactions with the atmosphere, the latter governing the position of phreatic surface. Most of previous studies {{have dealt with the}} mechanical behavior of the saturated tailings, showing the range of state variables for the occurrence of static <b>liquefaction.</b> The starting <b>point</b> of this research is an available hydro-mechanical characterization of a saturated silty tailing. We aim now at extending this characterization to the unsaturated state. The ongoing study of the mechanical behavior under shearing at imposed water content relies on tests done with a suction controlled triaxial cell, while the hydraulic behavior is studied by means of suction controlled oedometer tests. To account for the heterogenity of the tailing material in situ, the dependency of the water retention relationship on grain size distribution and on initial density / void ratio is under investigation. This preliminary step will allow setting up experiments aimed both at providing a wider hydro-mechanical characterization and an insight on possible onset of liquefaction in unsaturated condition...|$|R

50|$|Birch {{proposed}} that solar shades {{could be used}} to not merely cool the planet but that this {{could be used to}} reduce atmospheric pressure as well, by the process of freezing of the carbon dioxide. This requires Venus's temperature to be reduced, first to the <b>liquefaction</b> <b>point,</b> requiring a temperature less than 304 K and partial pressures of CO2 to bring the atmospheric pressure down to 73.8 bar (carbon dioxide's critical point); and from there reducing the temperature below 217 K (carbon dioxide's triple point). Below that temperature, freezing of atmospheric carbon dioxide into dry ice will cause it to deposit onto the surface. He then {{proposed that}} the frozen CO2 could be buried and maintained in that condition by pressure, or even shipped off-world (perhaps to provide greenhouse gas needed for terraforming of Mars or the moons of Jupiter). After this process was complete, the shades could be removed or solettas added, allowing the planet to partially warm again to temperatures comfortable for Earth life. A source of hydrogen or water would still be needed, and some of the remaining 3.5 bar of atmospheric nitrogen would need to be fixed into the soil. Birch suggests disrupting an icy moon of Saturn and bombarding Venus with its fragments to provide perhaps an average depth of 100 meters of water over the whole planet.|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 2010 – 2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence, Christchurch experienced widespread liquefaction, vertical settlement and lateral spreading. These geological processes caused extensive damage to both housing and infrastructure, and increased the need for geotechnical investigation substantially. Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) has become the most common method for liquefaction assessment in Christchurch, and issues have been identified with the soil behaviour type, liquefaction potential and vertical settlement estimates, particularly in the north-western suburbs of Christchurch where soils consist mostly of silts, clayey silts and silty clays. The CPT soil behaviour type often appears to over-estimate the fines content within a soil, while the liquefaction potential and vertical settlement are often calculated higher than those measured after the Canterbury earthquake sequence. To investigate these issues, laboratory work was carried out on three adjacent CPT/borehole pairs from the Groynes Park subdivision in northern Christchurch. Boreholes were logged according to NZGS standards, separated into stratigraphic layers, and laboratory tests were conducted on representative samples. Comparison of these results with the CPT soil behaviour types provided valuable information, where 62 % of soils on average were specified by the CPT at the Groynes Park subdivision as finer than what was actually present, 20 % of soils on average were specified as coarser than what was actually present, and only 18 % of soils on average were correctly classified by the CPT. Hence the CPT soil behaviour type is not accurately describing the stratigraphic profile at the Groynes Park subdivision, and it is understood that this is also the case in much of northwest Christchurch where similar soils are found. The computer software CLiq, by GeoLogismiki, uses assessment parameter constants which are able to be adjusted with each CPT file, in an attempt to make each more accurate. These parameter changes can in some cases substantially alter the results for liquefaction analysis. The sensitivity of the overall assessment method, raising and lowering the water table, lowering the soil behaviour type index, Ic, liquefaction cutoff value, the layer detection option, and the weighting factor option, were analysed by comparison with a set of ‘base settings’. The investigation confirmed that liquefaction analysis results can be very sensitive to the parameters selected, and demonstrated the dependency of the soil behaviour type on the soil behaviour type index, as the tested assessment parameters made very little to no changes to the soil behaviour type plots. The soil behaviour type index, Ic, developed by Robertson and Wride (1998) has been used to define a soil’s behaviour type, which is defined according to a set of numerical boundaries. In addition to this, the <b>liquefaction</b> cutoff <b>point</b> is defined as Ic > 2. 6, whereby it is assumed that any soils with an Ic value above this will not liquefy due to clay-like tendencies (Robertson and Wride, 1998). The method has been identified in this thesis as being potentially unsuitable for some areas of Christchurch as it was developed for mostly sandy soils. An alternative methodology involving adjustment of the Robertson and Wride (1998) soil behaviour type boundaries is proposed as follows:  Ic 3. 60 – Organics soils: peats. When the soil behaviour type boundary changes were applied to 15 test sites throughout Christchurch, 67 % showed an improved change of soil behaviour type, while the remaining 33 % remained unchanged, because they consisted almost entirely of sand. Within these boundary changes, the <b>liquefaction</b> cutoff <b>point</b> was moved from Ic > 2. 6 to Ic > 2. 5 and altered the liquefaction potential and vertical settlement to more realistic ii values. This confirmed that the overall soil behaviour type boundary changes appear to solve both the soil behaviour type issues and reduce the overestimation of liquefaction potential and vertical settlement. This thesis acts as a starting point towards researching the issues discussed. In particular, future work which would be useful includes investigation of the CLiq assessment parameter adjustments, and those which would be most suitable for use in clay-rich soils such as those in Christchurch. In particular consideration of how the water table can be better assessed when perched layers of water exist, with the limitation that only one elevation can be entered into CLiq. Additionally, a useful investigation would be a comparison of the known liquefaction and settlements from the Canterbury earthquake sequence with the liquefaction and settlement potentials calculated in CLiq for equivalent shaking conditions. This would enable {{the difference between the two}} to be accurately defined, and a suitable adjustment applied. Finally, inconsistencies between the Laser-Sizer and Hydrometer should be investigated, as the Laser-Sizer under-estimated the fines content by up to one third of the Hydrometer values...|$|R
