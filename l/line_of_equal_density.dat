50|$|Besides ocean depth, oceanographers use {{contour to}} {{describe}} diffuse variable phenomena much as meteorologists do with atmospheric phenomena. In particular, isobathytherms are <b>lines</b> showing depths <b>of</b> water with <b>equal</b> temperature, isohalines show <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> ocean salinity, and Isopycnals are surfaces <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> water <b>density.</b>|$|R

40|$|For the {{measurement}} of interfacial tensions between liquids <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>densities,</b> methods like drop weight, Wilhelmy plate etc. fail. A method is developed using a liquid bridge between a glass tip and a freely hanging piece of density {{higher than that of}} the fluids. The volume of liquid bridge that can sustain a piece of given weight cannot exceed some maximal value. This maximal volume is determined experimentally. A computer program makes it possible to tabulate the maximal volumes of the liquid bridge {{as a function of the}} interfacial tension for a given tip and metal piece. The program uses iteratively the circle segment approximation for the calculation of the meridian curve given by Kelvin.

50|$|Aerography is the {{production}} of weather charts. The information is supplied by radiosonde observations, principally. Constant-pressure charts are routinely constructed at standard air pressures. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 millibars (hectopascals) (hPa) (SI). Weather charts are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12 km). The <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> air pressure are called isobars. Isotherms are the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> air temperature.|$|R

500|$|When {{analyzing}} {{a weather}} map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, dewpoint, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The {{circle in the}} middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents [...] of wind, each half flag represents [...] When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each [...] of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted {{in the corner of}} the station model are in [...] inches. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> pressure), isallobars (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> pressure change), isotherms (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> temperature), and isotachs (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> wind speed) are drawn.
