5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 {{musician}} Frank Hamilton met Stracke at the Gate of Horn nightclub in Chicago. Together they {{founded the}} Old Town School {{and developed a}} teaching method {{with an emphasis on}} group learning. The school attempted to teach students popular folk songs of the day – songs by performers <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> Bill Broonzy, Josh White, and Odetta – and introduce students to the wealth of songs from other countries and less well known American folk songs. The school began as a series of lessons at Dawn Greening's home in Oak Park and later moved into a small storefront at 333 W. North Avenue in Old Town. Stracke wanted the classes to end with a jam session called Second Half so all levels of players could have fun playing together. Stracke served as the first director of the School.|$|E
500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME {{praised the}} album, writing that [...] "by {{the time the}} {{affecting}} acoustic lament 'Butterfly' wafts in <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> Star at a wildlife protection meeting, Pinkerton starts feeling like a truly moving album." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded the album 7.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "Pinkerton might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk." ...|$|E

500|$|Disney {{felt the}} need to keep interstitials (bridges) as used in Fantasia to give the viewer a chance to [...] "cleanse their {{emotional}} palate" [...] from the previous segment while providing some information about the next one. Don Hahn directed the live action scenes which were designed by Pixote Hunt. Hahn came up with the set and backgrounds while eating lunch; he proceeded to sketch a rough idea of what he imagined on a napkin. He [...] "wanted to show images on shapes <b>like</b> <b>big</b> sails of a clipper ship. They fly in on the wind and form a sort of Stonehenge concert hall {{in the middle of a}} vast, empty, imaginary plain".|$|E
500|$|<b>Like</b> <b>Big</b> Red Rock, {{the vastness}} of rural and outback landscapes were {{reflected}} in the artwork and music of Beyond. According to a review by Forester in The Age, the band and album have [...] "titles to suggest space, time and distance" [...] and some tracks had an [...] "indigenous appeal". The lead track's title, [...] "Moondah", translates into English as [...] "beyond". In April 1976 Loughnan, who wrote the song, said in a TV Times interview: [...] "The aborigines have had a raw deal in the past. The song expresses {{the hope that they}} get better treatment in the future". [...] "Moondah (beyond)" [...] begins with clapsticks, log drum, imitation didgeridoo, and sounds evocative of indigenous singing.|$|E

500|$|New Muppet {{characters}} were created and performed by puppeteers trained in Mexico City. [...] Abelardo, a giant parrot, was {{modeled after the}} American show's Big Bird, and <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> Bird, was a full-body puppet that was controlled by the puppeteer from inside the costume. [...] Paco, a grouchy green parrot, was based on Oscar the Grouch. [...] Abelardo and Paco were both played by Justo Martinez. [...] The Muppets Beto and Enrique, who were based upon Bert and Ernie of the American show, were called [...] "national favorites" [...] by the UPI {{less than three years}} after the show's premiere. [...] In 1975, Enrique and Beto were used to promote Mexico's nationwide free vaccination campaign.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation {{version of}} Dark Forces {{received}} less positive reviews. It holds an aggregate score on GameRankings of 59.57%. GameSpot wrote [...] "Though {{the speed of}} the Playstation allows for smooth movement, Dark Forces boasts a horrendously choppy frame rate." [...] IGN made a similar point; [...] "Unlike the PC and Mac versions, PlayStation Dark Forces is grainier than a loaf of bread. Close up, everything is blocky and pixelated, but even from far away the walls and textures look <b>like</b> <b>big,</b> chunky blocks. Even worse than the graphics, though, is the frame rate. Or lack thereof. The choppy motion takes so much away from the enjoyment of actually playing the game." [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games offers the same view, saying that the game is [...] "visually dated." ...|$|E
500|$|The first verse {{reflects}} Harrison and Prabhupada's {{discussion that}} day – although {{the reference to}} political leaders [...] "acting <b>like</b> <b>big</b> girls" [...] {{is an example of}} Harrison reverting to [...] "Scouse parlance", according to author Alan Clayson. The latter also notes the antipathy that Harrison felt towards politicians following the Bangladesh aid project, when the American and British governments continued to withhold funds intended for the millions of starving Bangladeshi refugees. The lyric centres on maya, or the illusory nature of human existence, as Harrison sings of humankind behaving as if [...] "we own this whole world", oblivious to the consequences and the end that awaits the individual in this life. Allison summarises the message to mean: [...] "karma is the law of our existence; substituting ego for God is our problem; we must prepare ourselves for death." ...|$|E

500|$|The human {{characters}} and, to {{a lesser}} extent, the animal ones were also criticized. Jones decried Chris as [...] "a dull, boring, uninspired character" [...] and also described Tanaka and Ella as [...] "bland" [...] stereotypes of Japanese and African-Americans, respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking Ring to defeat my enemies. GamesRadar bemoaned both the [...] "piss-poor Adventure characters" [...] and the original human ones. In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that [...] "one of the key successes" [...] of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> and the Chaotix. Fans were divided on the merit of the Thorndykes.|$|E
500|$|Connelly {{contributed to}} four tracks, {{including}} [...] "Blame", which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group Tower of Power. [...] Nicole Blackman, KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals {{to the track}} [...] "Dogma", which was adapted from the ten-minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. [...] "Power", meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, Wax Trax!, for a radio promo song. [...] Konietzko said he'd heard [...] "radio didn't <b>like</b> <b>big</b> female choruses", so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson {{to help with the}} song, which he called [...] "dumb and catchy". [...] The hidden track of the album, [...] "Fairy", is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. [...] Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's [...] "dirty fantasies". [...] He also said it was not a serious track: [...] "it was more like kids at play". [...] For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of <b>like</b> <b>Big</b> Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E

500|$|Gene Hoglan, later {{known as}} the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, {{provided}} backing vocals on the song [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries". [...] "Back {{at the time it}} was Jeff [...] and Kerry doing the 'Evil!' You know, it didn't sound too heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, 'You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing <b>like</b> <b>big</b> gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,' and they were like 'Good idea.' But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' So I was like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'" [...] On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also <b>like</b> <b>big</b> orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not <b>like</b> <b>big</b> issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
