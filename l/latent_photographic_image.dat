40|$|Conjoint ESR {{and optical}} studies of silver atoms (Ag 0) and silver {{clusters}} formed in aqueous and alcoholic matrices {{resulted in the}} unequivocal assignments of optical absorptions {{to a range of}} Ag 0 solvates and to the molecular clusters Ag+ 2 and Ag 43 +. ESR studies of un-irradiated silver halides revealed the presence of at least two instrinsic centres which might act as the special sites at which latent images are formed during the primary photographic process. On irradiation, these materials exhibited additional signals which were thought to be CESR resonances associated with pseudo- molecular silver particles, Ag 0 n. The size of these centres is uncertain. The data suggests that they consist of more than 5 - 6 atoms and are smaller than 45 A.

5000|$|A {{developable}} <b>photographic</b> <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> forms when crystals {{of silver}} halide in an emulsion layer {{are exposed to}} light. The initial nucleation phase is chemically and thermodynamically unstable; it is thus temperature sensitive, and involves the production of one, or very few silver atoms as sub-latent image specks in each silver halide crystal. Once a clump of a few silver atoms has formed at one site within a crystal {{it is capable of}} triggering the development of the whole crystal. This greatly amplifies the effect of relatively few photons to produce a metallic silver image [...] "grain". With low-intensity light, the sub-latent image speck may rapidly revert to silver halide before sufficient photons have been absorbed to make it stable. Hypersensitization techniques are intended to lengthen the lifetime of the unstable sub-latent image, to increase the chances of the silver halide crystal receiving enough light to form an image that will catalyze the action of the developer.|$|R

40|$|Through {{a body of}} {{photographic}} work, this thesis examines how an engagement with photographic technology presents the opportunity to destabilise the established conceptions {{of the performance of}} the medium. Historically photographic technology is presented as a series of seamless mechanised transactions that is potentially free of human interaction and situated as a mute participant in the technical production of the <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> Acknowledging the role technology manifests in the production of photography, I examine through my work and critical reflection, how my creative practice can harness these technical processes to alter the aesthetic and theoretical positioning of a photographic practice. Three key bodies of work: Uninhabited Space, The Reflective Field and Machine Time_Nature Time explore a successive development of a studio practice through a series of Contextual developments to uncover and interrogate the procedures at play. The Contextual developments employed a range of fundamental materials, techniques and processes native to photographic practice. The first key work, Uninhabited Space explores the role film processes play in the authoring of a <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> The work specifically investigates the limitations of film technology as a means to demonstrate how a ‘void of information’ might be reinterpreted as visual information within a <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> The subsequent key work, The Reflective Field conceptually challenges the connection between the <b>photographic</b> <b>image</b> and its presentation to resituate the <b>photographic</b> <b>image</b> as a transformable surface. The final key work, Machine Time_Nature Time is presented through extended Contextual developments that examine the role of contemporary technology {{in the creation of the}} <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> Digital, electronic and computational processes are deployed to augment the capture of the <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> Reflection on the outcome of this final body of work led to the positioning that technological disruption was used as a creative strategy. This conceptual revision initiates a theoretical evaluation {{of photographic}} practice that allows the opportunity to resituate the subliminal role of technology in the production of the <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> The research concludes with a final body of work, Machine Time_Nature Time in which I argue the disruption of technology contributes to an alternative understanding of photographic practice and questions how might deviation of these subliminal processes alter or augment a body of creative photographic based work. By presenting a series of photographic works in exhibition format, the research incites a recursive questioning of what constitutes the <b>photographic</b> <b>image,</b> what is selectively included, and what is silently occluded.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to synthesizing <b>photographic</b> <b>images</b> conditioned on semantic layouts. Given a semantic label map, our approach produces an <b>image</b> with <b>photographic</b> appearance that conforms to the input layout. The approach thus functions as a rendering engine that takes a two-dimensional semantic specification of the scene and produces a corresponding <b>photographic</b> <b>image.</b> Unlike recent and contemporaneous work, our approach does not rely on adversarial training. We show that <b>photographic</b> <b>images</b> can be synthesized from semantic layouts by a single feedforward network with appropriate structure, trained end-to-end with a direct regression objective. The presented approach scales seamlessly to high resolutions; we demonstrate this by synthesizing <b>photographic</b> <b>images</b> at 2 -megapixel resolution, the full resolution of our training data. Extensive perceptual experiments on datasets of outdoor and indoor scenes demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented approach are considerably more realistic than alternative approaches.

40|$|The {{camera is}} one of the most precise {{instruments}} available to the artist for visual expression.
