5|$|Another {{factor that}} brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
500|$|In The Independent, {{television}} reviewer Tom Sutcliffe {{discussed the}} documentary, noting {{that it was}} likely to court controversy and cause problems for Holland. Although remarking {{that he did not}} know what devout Muslims would think of Holland's arguments, he asserted that they did not have [...] "a monopoly on literalist affront". John Crace reviewed the documentary for The Guardian, noting that Holland was no [...] "attention-seeking, neo-Conservative, Niall Ferguson lookalike" [...] but was probably a social liberal. Crace opined that while most Westerners would find Holland's findings uncontentious, many devout Muslims would consider it blasphemous. Considering Holland excessively cautious, he thought the presenter [...] "was <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> half expecting a fatwa at any minute." ...|$|E

500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] It was his job, with Davis <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows {{a fairly}} conventional depiction {{of this very}} common scene, with some unusual details. [...] The number of shepherds is rather large at nine, and the pose of the shepherd pointing at the baby Jesus while <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> outside the picture space suggests that more are arriving. Or possibly he has seen the approaching Magi, the next arrivals in the traditional narrative. [...] Saint Joseph, often a rather superfluous figure in paintings of the Nativity, is shown making himself useful by carrying hay, presumably to feed the ox and ass, in the background, so filling {{a gap in the}} composition, and perhaps distracting them from joining in with the bagpipe music. The relegation of the ox and ass to a dimly-lit background is typical of 17th century compositions.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Adorno {{reversed}} his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came {{second to the}} development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an Habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic. At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like [...] "anxiety," [...] "inwardness" [...] and [...] "leap"—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.|$|E
