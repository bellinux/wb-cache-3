Lincomycin biosynthesis occurs via a biphasic pathway. Propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are each synthesized separately, which are then condensed to form N-demethyllincomycin and finally methylated by S-adenosyl methionine to give lincomycin.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS) is {{a significant}} human pathogen. GBS colonizes the vagina {{and it is one}} of the most important causes of early neonatal sepsis and meningitis. In many countries, screening of pregnant women and intrapartal use of antibiotics are common practice. Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistant strains of GBS are a significant problem, because these antibiotics are the second line therapy in case of penicillin allergy. Aim: Our aim was to investigate the frequency of antibiotic resistant strains of GBS and to detect macrolide resistance phenotypes in GBS strains obtained from pregnant women in Belgrade. Material and Methods: 105 GBS isolates were obtained from vaginal swabs of pregnant women attending two Gynecology and Obstetrics Centers in Belgrade. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and D test were performed on Mueller Hinton agar. Results: Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance was found in 30. 4 %, and 23. 8 % of isolates, respectively. There was a high frequency of tetracycline resistant strains (88. 6 %). Most frequent macrolide resistant phenotype was iMLSb (macrolide and inducibile <b>lincosamide</b> resistance) (62. 4 %). Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that there is a high level of macrolide resistance among GBS isolates in Serbia and the active surveillance is needed...|$|E

40|$|Macrolide (including {{erythromycin}} and azithromycin) and <b>lincosamide</b> (including clindamycin) antibiotics {{are recommended}} {{for treatment of}} penicillin-allergic patients with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Resistance to erythromycin in S. pyogenes can {{be as high as}} 48 % in specific populations in the United States. Macrolide and <b>lincosamide</b> resistance in S. pyogenes is mediated by several different genes. Expression of the erm(A) or erm(B) genes causes resistance to erythromycin and inducible or constitutive resistance to clindamycin, respectively, whereas expression of the mef(A) gene leads to resistance to erythromycin but not clindamycin. We studied the resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin and clindamycin at an urban tertiary-care hospital. Of 196 sequential isolates from throat cultures, 15 (7. 7 %) were resistant to erythromycin. Three of these were also constitutively resistant to clindamycin and had the erm(B) gene. Five of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were resistant to clindamycin upon induction with erythromycin and had the erm(A) gene. The remaining seven erythromycin-resistant isolates were susceptible to clindamycin even upon induction with erythromycin and had the mef(A) gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis and emm typing demonstrated that the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes comprised multiple strains.

40|$|Macrolides and <b>lincosamides</b> are {{important}} antibacterials {{for the treatment}} of many common infections in cattle and pigs. Products for in-feed medication with these compounds in combination with other antimicrobials are commonly used in Europe. Most recently approved injectable macrolides have very long elimination half-lives in both pigs and cattle, which allows once-only dosing regimens. Both in-feed medication and use of long-acting injections result in low concentrations of the active substance for prolonged periods, which causes concerns related to development of antimicrobial resistance. Acquired resistance to macrolides and <b>lincosamides</b> among food animal pathogens, including some zoonotic bacteria, has now emerged. A comparison of studies on the prevalence of resistance is difficult, since for many micro-organisms no agreed standards for susceptibility testing are available. With animal pathogens, the most dramatic increase in resistance has been seen in the genus Brachyspira. Resistance towards macrolides and <b>lincosamides</b> has also been detected in staphylococci isolated from pigs and streptococci from cattle.
