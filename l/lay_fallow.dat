At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E

Hayes believes that the email was likely a slightly altered version of the Sampley article, which was in turn heavily based on Martin's 2004 press release.

However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} emergence of Polish rural settlements in Wisconsin between 1850 and 1920 by examining selected patterns of Polish immigration and settlement, individuals, and groups involved in placing Poles on Wisconsin land. The time frame reflects the most crucial period in the inception and development of all discernable Polish rural settlements in Wisconsin. This study begins with the examination of push and pull factors that brought Poles to Wisconsin. In subsequent chapters, settlements are studied chronologically within their respective geographic locations on the agricultural map of Wisconsin. To facilitate {{the understanding of the}} complex interplay of time and locations, a line has been drawn across the central section of the state to demarcate the cut-over land of northern Wisconsin. Consequently, the dissertation is divided into two parts. In Part I, the study focuses on the settlements south of the cut-over. Part II introduces the concept of the cut-over land and its significance to Wisconsin and to Polish settlements. Then, it examines one religiously motivated settlement and another that resulted from a buy-out of a lumber operation. Communities that emerged from the efforts of Polish colonization agents are the subject of the subsequent chapter, and four have been selected to represent the multitude of small and big land agents and speculators. The following chapter is devoted to the efforts of J. J. Hof, who founded Polish settlements in northeastern Wisconsin. Subsequently, efforts of other non-Polish agents are examined by sampling four enterprises and entrepreneurs that represent various approaches, strategies, locations, and time frames. This chapter is followed by Conclusions and Selected Bibliography. This dissertation helps to build a more complete understanding of the Polish experience in the social history of Wisconsin and the United States. Moreover, it contributes to the general study of the immigrant presence in rural America, a field of historical research that has been <b>laying</b> <b>fallow</b> until recently. Consequently, this work provides a foundation for a laboratory of further studies of immigrant influx into rural America...|$|R

60|$|The Osmanlis, whose nomadic forefathers {{had fled}} before {{the face of}} the Mongols out of Central Asia, took the {{heritage}} which had slipped from the Mongols' grasp, and gathered all threads of authority in Western Asia into their hands. The most valuable spoil of their Asiatic conquests was the Caliphate. Hulaku, the sacker of Bagdad, had put the Caliph Mustasim to death, and the remnant of the Abbasids had kept up a shadowy succession at Cairo, under the protection of the Sultan of Egypt. Selim the Osmanli, when he entered Cairo as a conqueror in 1517, caused the contemporary Abbasid to cede his title, for what it was worth, to him and his successors. It was a doubtful title, scorned by all Shias and regarded coldly by many Sunni rulers who were unwilling to recognise a spiritual superior in their most formidable temporal rival. But such as it was, it strengthened the Osmanli's hold on his dominions. Caliph of Islam, victorious guardian of the Moslem marches, and heir by conquest of imperial Rûm, the Osmanli Sultan held his Asiatic provinces with ease; but the best security for his tenure was the misery to which they were reduced. Commerce and cultivation ebbed, population dwindled, and nomads still drifted in upon what once had been settled lands. The Ottoman Government, desiring a barrier against Persia, encouraged the Kurds to spread themselves over Armenia; it welcomed less the Shammar and Anazeh Arabs, who broke over the Euphrates about the year 1700 and turned the last fields of Northern Mesopotamia to desolation; but it was too impotent or indifferent to turn them out. Western Asia <b>lay</b> <b>fallow</b> under the Ottoman cannon-wheels. There have been fallow periods before in the slow rhythm of its life--under the Persians, for instance, who overran all lands and peoples of the East in the sixth century B.C., overshadowed the Greeks for a moment, as the Osmanlis overshadowed Europe, halted, too massive for offence but seemingly unassailable, and then collapsed pitifully before the probing spears of Alexander.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{planting}} {{years for}} a single swidden for the Bine farmers. In the first year the Bine plant primary taro root with a few subsidiary crops like bananas and sweet potatoes. In the second year taro root makes up about 50 percent of the swidden {{and the rest of}} the swidden is mixed with about 15 other plants. After the second year the Bine farmers move on to an adjacent swidden and allow the previous swidden to <b>lay</b> <b>fallow</b> or unplanted for a period of 5 to 10 years in order to repopulate the vegetation (Eden 1993). The number of years that a swidden will <b>lay</b> <b>fallow</b> is determined by the plants demand for the nitrogen in the soil. Some plants will leach the soil of nitrogen in a few years and require four or five times that fallow; while other plants can be planted for many years and <b>lay</b> <b>fallow</b> only one or two times the planting period (Hyde 2010).
