Criminal {{proceedings}} against <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> Criminal proceedings against <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> {{represent a}} significant innovation for Czech criminal procedure law. Adoption of Act nř 418 / 2011, about Criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> and criminal proceedings against them, is considered as {{acceptance of the}} world's phenomenon of enactment of the institute of Criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The lawmaker had chosen a special regulation for criminal proceedings against <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> which however does not describe the issues solely. So the Penal Code is considered subsidiary applicable regardless it does regulate criminal proceedings against a natural person.

40|$|Tortious acts of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> have {{unforeseen}} harmful {{consequences in}} all areas. In the greedy desire to gain profit, certain <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> {{do not have}} any regard for the most important resources of individuals and society. Damage resulting from the commission of criminal acts is very high for the whole society, {{especially when it comes to}} crimes against the environment. In order to prevent and combat corporate crime in criminal law, an increasingly wider acceptance of criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> was adopted. This paper discusses the basic characteristics of corporate crime, as well as the reasons for the introduction of the criminal responsibility of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> In this regard, we analyzed the law provisions regarding the liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> for criminal offenses, and concluded that despite the criminal-political need to react with more serious sanctions to the offenses of <b>legal</b> <b>entities,</b> there are certain obstacles and problems that stand in the way of introducing this responsibility...|$|R

The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings.|$|E

The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed {{around the same time}} to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E
40|$|A {{heated debate}} {{was going on}} {{during the past few}} years among Czech lawyers {{concerning}} punishment of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> It culminated as the law on criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> and proceedings against them was passed. However, this has not solved all the problems of legal regulation of delicts committed by <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The question of reform of administrative punishment remains relevant, although not urgent. The current legislation suffers certain defects, in particular its incompleteness, which has to be addressed in legal practice by using laws whose primary field of application lies elsewhere; those laws do not address all peculiarities of administrative punishment of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> While the main discussion is centered on substantive law, proceedings for administrative delicts of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> deserve attention as well.

Crime of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> is an up-to-date issue, being a phenomenon of a considerable danger and it is desirable to make it a subject of a comprehensive research in order to find the most suitable prevention or an adequate reaction to that crime. Understanding criminological {{factors related to}} crime of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> can help to prepare matching provisions which can serve as an efficient tool for prevention of and response to this type of crime. This thesis is divided into four chapters.

A full merger, including the two port commissions, was opposed by Tacoma, who feared that the more populous King County would have more votes on the combined commission than Pierce County, who were more dependent on the cargo port. In March 2015, the plan was pushed back to August while working on specifics of the alliance, including a decision on which <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> it would fall under.

5|$|TCI's {{independence}} as {{a separate}} <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> from its parent corporation ended in 1952, a century after {{the founding of the}} Sewanee Furnace Company, when the it became the Tennessee Coal & Iron Division of U.

Stagnation and decline began in 1962 when a majority of the mines in the Birmingham region were closed as domestic ores and coal were superseded by cheaper foreign products, especially from Venezuela. The 1970s and 80s brought about a downsizing and eventual consolidation of the Fairfield and Ensley works, mirroring the general decline of heavy industry in the USA throughout those decades.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the {{questions related to}} the criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities,</b> with focus on their sanctioning. The criminal law is being traditionally linked {{to the criminal liability}} of an individual. The social environment has changed in the last decades {{in such a way that}} it was vital to reflect its negative consequences. In a number of EU countries, the action resulted in implementation of criminal lability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The Czech Republic used to be a country where the criminal lability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> was not complied with for many years. The change was brought by adopting the act of No. 418 / 2011 valid from 1 st January 2012, dealing with criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> and its related proceedings. The thesis is devided into four chapters. The opening chapter focuses on theoretical questions of criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> Different approaches to the matter are analysed here in detail, international and European commitments of the Czech Republic in relation to criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> are also mentioned.

40|$|Resumé Issues of Criminal Liability of <b>Legal</b> <b>Entities</b> This thesis {{deals with}} {{criminal}} liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> and with delictual liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> Even {{though there is}} no Czech equivalent for the institution of criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities,</b> and consequently it cannot be part of Czech legal system, there have been many heated debates, conducted both by professionals, politicians and amateurs. Czech criminal law does not contain the term collective responsibility, as it is traditionally based on the individual criminal liability. It has adopted the principle societas delinquere non potest, and for this reason the introduction of criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> would be perceived as massive change, change that could have profound impact on the Czech criminal law as such. The topic is controversial; it is manifested in the way the arguments pro and contra are submitted. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Basic definitions are followed by a short historical overview of delictual liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> in European continental law. Next chapter lists arguments pro and contra introduction of criminal liability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> Tendencies in international and in European continental law constitute one of the main arguments for introducing this institution into Czech legal [...] ...|$|R

Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the Holy Spirit had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew.
