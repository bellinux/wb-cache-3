That being said, CCPs {{significantly}} lack practical experience with advanced skills such as IV initiation, peripheral access to cardiovascular system for fluid and drug administration, advanced airway, and many other techniques. Where an PCP and ACP may run 40–50 medical codes per year a CCP may run 1–2 in an entire career. IV/IO starts are nearly non-existent {{in the field and}} for this reason CCPs are required to attend nearly double the amount of time in classroom situations or in hospital to keep current.

50|$|Tents must {{register}} with the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> (students in charge of overseeing and enforcing K-ville rules and regulations) prior to setting up. There are three types: Black registration, which is the longest and most intense option in which the use of actual tents was forbidden in the past. In addition to this, all 12 tenters used to sleep in K-ville during black tenting. Today, however, tents are allowed during Black registration and only 10 people must sleep in the tent. Blue registration is the next period, in which a tent can register at any time before approximately two weeks prior to the game; after this, White registration goes into effect, which is significantly more complicated. For Blue registration, a tent group need only give their names to the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> and start tenting. However, for White registration, students must meet the <b>line</b> <b>monitors</b> at a location on campus that is disclosed on a website at a specified time; {{this results in a}} hectic dash to the location once it is made public. Most tenting groups station members around campus, one of whom is called when the location is disclosed online. Hundreds of tent representatives usually appear at the White registration location for the 30 remaining spots not taken by Black and Blue tenters, with the spots filling up in a matter of minutes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{principle}} of heat transfer, a monitoring software package about identifying erosion profile of submerged arc furnace with “freeze ” lining is developed by VC++. Reliability of traditional <b>lining</b> without <b>monitoring</b> system and “freeze ” <b>lining</b> with <b>monitoring</b> software are evaluated by Fuzzy FMECA Method. There is a conclusion can be draw that the hazard rating of submerged arc furnace with traditional lining is 2. 9094. This value of “freeze ” lining is 2. 1087.

50|$|A Wireless {{powerline}} sensor {{hangs from}} an {{overhead power line}} and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the sensor does not contact anything but a single live conductor, no high-voltage isolation is needed. The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy scavenged from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured. Overhead power <b>line</b> <b>monitoring</b> helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.|$|E
