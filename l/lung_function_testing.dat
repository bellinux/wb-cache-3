40|$|The goal of {{monitoring}} <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> in cystic fibrosis (CF) is to detect deterioration of disease {{at an early}} stage.

Theoretically, <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> could then be helpful to the clinician in several ways: * <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> could detect pathological changes in the lung at the earliest possible stage, leading to intervention early in life, and, possibly, to a better prognosis for CF patients. * <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> could detect pathological change in the lung more precisely than clinical signs and symptoms, leading to better evaluation and refinement of treatment strategies, and, eventually, to a better prognosis for CF patients...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms such as {{difficulty}} {{breathing and}} chest pain {{may be present}} if the disease {{is present in the}} ribs, scapula, or thoracic vertebrae. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> that are seen in asthma. Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions. Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition.|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in {{children}} above {{five years old}} is standardised similarly as is in adult population (1). Nevertheless bronchial provocation testing can be more hazardous since the calibre and reactivity of childhood airway is different. We analysed the frequency of different <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> procedures and addressed the safety issues of bronchial provocation testing {{in children}}. Methods. We analysed <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> results in 517 children, older than 5 years, tested in our laboratory in threeyear period. Spirometry was done in every patient, metacholine provocation test {{was used as a}} part of diagnostic work-up in suspected asthma. In case of airway obstruction, bronchodilator test with salbutamol was used instead of a metacholine provocation test. Results. The most common procedure in children was spirometry with bronchial provocation test as a part of diagnostic work-up of obstructive syndrome (mostly asthma). 291 children required metacholine test and 153 tests were interpreted as positive. The decline in expiratory flows (forced expiratory flow in first second – FEV 1) in positive tests was greater than in adult population as was the dose of metacholine, needed to induce bronchoconstriction. The compliance of children was better than in adults. Conclusions. <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in children is reliable and safe and can be done in a well-standardised laboratory that follows the regulations of such testing in adults. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis show that {{research}} in the field of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in infants has moved from methodological issues towards clinical applications. This development is mainly the result of publications of guidelines for infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> and standardization of the equipment used, by the European Respiratory Society en de American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) (7 - 10). As a result, normative data have become available for different lung function methods, allowing comparison of data from different centers. In addition, several biomedical engineering companies have marketed equipment with specifications according to the guidelines given by the ERS/ATS. These developments are a necessity for wide applications of infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in a clinical setting, such as collaborative studies and multicenter drug trials in infants with airway disease (II). On the other hand, there are high costs for buying complete recording systems and training the staff. In addition, most methods require sedation of the infant. Therefore, infant lung function measurements will probably be established primarily in larger, mostly academic, centers. The forthcoming challenges for those involved in this field will be to develop methods that are cheap to buy and simple to use, still providing essential information. These methods should be applicable in infants without sedation. When this has been achieved, infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> may even move out of the clinic (II) ...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{have shown}} that {{patients}} (P 1 and P 2) generated significant higher AUC(CV[*]>[*] 20 %) values compared to healthy subjects (S 1 to S 13) (p[*]=[*] 0.006), {{which is consistent with}} the result of a previous study [8].

40|$|Background and objective: It is {{currently}} recommended that patients avoid large meals {{prior to their}} <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether this recommendation is necessary in clinical practice. Methods: A randomized controlled cross-over trial was conducted. Subjects performed <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> (spirometry, measurement of lung volumes and gas transfer) prior to, directly following and 2 h after consuming a large breakfast. On the control arm, subjects performed the same <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> while fasting for the duration of the morning. The study subjects comprised 12 healthy subjects, 10 COPD patients and 10 patients with interstitial lung disease. Results: There were no significant differences between measurements on the meal and control days for FEV 1, FVC, TLC or DLCO. There were no significant changes with time in any of these parameters over the course of either the meal or control morning.

40|$|In cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> {{is a means}} of monitoring progression of lung disease. The preschool years have often been referred to as the "silent years" due to the previous lack suitable measures of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in this age group. This review outlines the various techniques of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in preschool children with CF in the clinical setting. This includes measures requiring tidal breathing including the forced oscillation technique, the interrupter technique, plethysmography, and multiple breath washout, as well as spirometry that requires respiratory maneuvers. We describe the feasibility and variability of different lung function methods used in preschoolers and report measurements made during tidal breathing have greater feasibility, although greater variability compared to spirometry. We also report associations with lung function and markers of CF lung disease. In the preschool age group measurements made during tidal breathing may be more appropriate in the clinic setting than those that require a higher degree of cooperation and specific respiratory maneuvers.
