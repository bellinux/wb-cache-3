40|$|The clean pull is {{a common}} {{exercise}} among athletes. Some athletes use <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> in this exercise, but efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> has not been examined. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effects of <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> on velocity, force and power during the clean pull. Five male professional Rugby Union players performed two sets of two repetitions of the clean pull with a 140 -kg barbell under two conditions: with and without the <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> in a counterbalanced order. An optical encoder was attached to the barbell, and peak velocity of the barbell, and force / power applied to the barbell were obtained through an inverse dynamics approach. The highest value amongst four trials (two sets of two repetitions) in each condition for each subject was used to compare between the two conditions by effect size. Four out of five subjects showed greater peak velocity (10. 1 - 28. 5 %), force (2. 9 - 34. 4 %), and power (6. 5 - 46. 5 %) with the <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> but one subject did not show a difference between conditions. The effect sizes for the velocity, force, and power were 1. 22, 1. 52, and 1. 31, respectively, showing large effects. It is concluded that using <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> is beneficial for athletes who wish to enhance velocity, force and power during clean pull...|$|R

50|$|A {{handling}} strap {{can help}} the <b>lifting.</b> The <b>strap</b> for this use should be 6 m long, at least 3 cm wide to share out the weight and avoid the pain, and resist at least to a weight of 150 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Wrist straps: Wrist <b>straps</b> (<b>lifting</b> <b>straps)</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{to assist in}} gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps {{can be used to}} isolate muscle groups like in [...] "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the deadlift. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their grip strength, just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than {{they might be able to}} handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.|$|R
40|$|As the United States highway {{infrastructure}} {{is in need}} of rehabilitation due to increasing traffic needs and structural inadequacies, use of precast concrete elements is increasing. Use of precast concrete systems provide various advantages, including minimizing traffic disruption, increasing the quality of the final product, and lowering life-cycle costs. Both the Federal Highway Administration and the Iowa Department of Transportation have recognized the benefits of using precast concrete elements in bridge construction to help reduce the duration of construction projects. This thesis focuses on the laboratory testing of full-depth precast, prestressed concrete deck panels used in the construction of a continuous four-girder, three span bridge over Squaw Creek on 120 th Street in Boone County, Iowa. Various laboratory tests were conducted on a single panel and on two panels connected by a closure pour. These tests ranged from determining physical properties of the panel (compressive strength and prestressing force), to determining the panel 2 ̆ 7 s response in various circumstances (moving with a crane, during field leveling, and under loading). Tests were conducted to determine physical characteristics of a deck panel such as compressive strength and stress in the mild reinforcing due to prestressing. The average compressive strength of the concrete core samples was 7, 600 psi, which exceeded the specified compressive strength of 5, 000 psi. Prestressing strands in one post-tensioning channel were cut to determine the amount of stress in each strand due to prestressing. Of the six bars instrumented, five were found to have a stress lower than that expected from the initial prestressing force. Strains in the mild reinforcing bars were monitored in the laboratory while a panel was lifted with a crane. Two different strap configurations were used to lift the panel; the first configuration used four <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> and the second used two <b>lifting</b> <b>straps.</b> Results from these tests showed the strap configuration did not {{have a significant effect on}} the strain induced in the mild reinforcing bars. The total strain (measured plus induced due to prestressing) of a bar used during these tests had a maximum value of 70...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} prevent the bar from rolling out of the hands, some lifters {{have been known to}} use an Olympic weightlifting {{technique}} known as the hook grip. This is similar to an overhand grip, but the thumbs are inside, allowing the lifter to [...] "hook" [...] onto them with the fingers. The hook grip can make it easier to hold heavier weights using less grip strength, and keeps both shoulders and elbows in a symmetrical position. While it theoretically takes much of the stress off of the joints which might be created by the twisting of a mixed grip it has the disadvantage of being extremely uncomfortable for the thumbs, something which those who advocate it says will pass once a lifter becomes accustomed to it. Another, but rarely used method is a combination of the mixed overhand-underhand grip and the hook grip, preferred by people who lift heavier weights than their grip can handle, but who don't want to rely on <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> or other supportive gear.|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{prototype}} of a large pressure vessel under development for eventual use as a habitable module for long spaceflight (e. g., for transporting humans to Mars). The vessel is a hybrid that comprises an inflatable shell attached to a rigid central structural core. The inflatable shell is, itself, a hybrid that comprises (1) a pressure bladder restrained against expansion by (2) a web of straps made from high-strength polymeric fabrics. On Earth, pressure vessels like this could be used, for example, as portable habitats that could be set up quickly in remote locations, portable hyperbaric chambers for treatment of decompression sickness, or flotation devices for offshore platforms. In addition, {{some aspects of the}} design of the fabric straps could be adapted to such other items as <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> parachute straps, and automotive safety belts. Figure 2 depicts selected aspects of the design of a vessel of this type with a toroidal configuration. The bladder serves as an impermeable layer to keep air within the pressure vessel and, for this purpose, is sealed to the central structural core. The web includes longitudinal and circumferential straps. To help maintain the proper shape upon inflation after storage, longitudinal and circumferential straps are indexed together at several of their intersections. Because the web is not required to provide a pressure seal and the bladder is not required to sustain structural loads, the bladder and the web can be optimized for their respective functions. Thus, the bladder can be sealed directly to the rigid core without having to include the web in the seal substructure, and the web can be designed for strength. The ends of the longitudinal straps are attached {{to the ends of the}} rigid structural core by means of clevises. Each clevis pin is surrounded by a roller, around which a longitudinal strap is wrapped to form a lap seam with itself. The roller is of a large diameter chosen to reduce bending of the fibers in the strap. The roller also serves to equalize the load in the portions of the strap on both sides of the clevis pin. The lap seam is formed near the clevis by use of a tapered diamond stitch: This stitch is designed specifically to allow fibers in the stitch and strap to relax under load in such a manner that the load becomes more nearly evenly distributed among all fibers in the stitch region. Thus, the tapered diamond stitch prevents load concentrations that could cause premature failure of the strap and thereby increases the strength of the strap/structural-core joint. The lap seam can be rated at > 90 percent of the strength of the strap material...|$|R
5000|$|The race {{continues}} {{on a road}} going up a cliff, with Buddy ahead; Buddy is <b>lifted,</b> his <b>straps</b> intact, from the saddle, then caught by a tree and tangled up. With some trouble, {{he returns to the}} race, only to encounter a rickety bridge, easily conquered first by the villain, who then shakes it as Buddy rides upon it. The bridge rolls up into a wheel with Buddy, sitting a-gee, inside. The wheel crashes into a rock by the precipice of a cliff and breaks; the horse is down, and Buddy, flung over the edge, hangs on a small tree branch on the cliffside. The villain laughs, and, in an effort to send Buddy to his watery doom, tosses a large rock at the branch, which bounces the boulder back up, hitting the scoundrel in the face; the villain falls from the perch of the cliff, taking the grass and the horses with him. The flimsy branch breaks under all of the new weight, and so Our Hero, his adversary, and the horses fall into the water.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this record. This paper discusses several new technologies for mooring floating marine energy converter (MEC) devices, such as wave energy generators, tidal current turbines and floating wind turbines. The principal mooring component is a special nylon fiber rope which provides cyclic tension fatigue endurance much superior to that of conventional nylon ropes. The nylon fiber is treated with a new proprietary coating which has excellent wet yarn abrasion properties. The parallel-subrope type rope construction further reduces internal abrasion. Extensive laboratory testing was carried out on this new nylon rope design. Cyclic tension fatigue tests were conducted at mean loads and load amplitudes typical of actual service conditions and at higher mean loads and amplitudes. These tests demonstrate that the special nylon rope has essentially the same, desirable stretch characteristics as conventional nylon rope and has much better endurance performance. The mooring connection to the floating MEC device consists of a high-modulus fiber rope pendant which passes through a low-friction bell-mouth nylon fairlead on the MEC device. This eliminates the use of heavy, unreliable chain in this critical connection. A unique bag anchor system would be used on sand, clay, rock and other sea beds in which conventional drag embedment anchors and driven piles are impractical. The bag anchor consists of a large abrasion resistant carcass with <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> and top closure. The bag is transported to site in a collapsed form and is filled with local sand or aggregate to provide ballast weight. Several or many such bags are enclosed within a fiber rope net for deployment and are grouped together for connection to the mooring line. The paper will be {{of particular interest to}} designers of moorings for MEC systems in shallow water and severe wave environments. It will also be of interest for other mooring applications. This work {{would not have been possible}} without the funding and support of the Scottish Government, the Carbon Trust and Innovate UK.    The project was funded under the Marine Renewables Commercialization Fund (MRCF) and Marine Energy Supporting Array Technologies (MESAT).    Other partners who contributed to this project include Lloyd’s Register, DNV‐GL, TenCate, Orion Energy Centre, Nylacast, and offshore wind developer IDEOL.     Input and encouragement was provided by tidal power developer partner Bluewater, and wave energy developers AWS Ocean Energy and Pelamis. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{any type}} of crate reaches a certain size, more boards may be added. These boards are often called Cleats. A cleat is used to provide support to a panel when that panel has reached a size that is may require added support based on the method of transportation. Cleats may be placed {{anywhere}} between the edges of a given panel. On crates, cleat placement is often determined by {{the width of the}} plywood used on plywood sheathed crates. On other crates, cleats are often evenly spaced as required to strengthen the panel. Sometimes two cleats are added across the top panel of a crate placed as needed to give the top of the crate added strength where <b>lifting</b> chains or <b>straps</b> may press on the crate while lifting.|$|R
50|$|During the show's run, the stunts {{took their}} toll on the trucks (for example, one clip that appears in the opening credits clearly shows an axle {{breaking}} after a jump), so several different years, make (Chevy/GMC) and model trucks are used during the show's initial run. As a result, there are some inconsistencies in the episodes. For instance, in the pilot episode the truck (a 1980 model) has two square headlights and a light tan interior. For {{the remainder of the}} series, it almost always had the quad headlight configuration of the 1981-1987 models, with a dark brown interior. The truck usually appeared to be a long bed model, but sometimes a short bed model was used. The truck was powered by a stock 350 V8 and Turbo 350 automatic transmission. After destroying several trucks due to the huge jumps, a custom built jump truck was built as a solution. It had a reinforced frame and heavy duty axle trusses, dual shocks all around, suspension limiting <b>straps,</b> <b>lift</b> blocks, and a steel weight box in the bed (which was loaded with up to 800 lbs of lead for a jump) and a mid-mounted engine that actually sat {{in the middle of the}} cab. This greatly reduced the number of trucks scrapped during the show's production.|$|R
40|$|Profound changes {{occur within}} the female breast with {{increasing}} age; glandular atrophy, increased skin laxity and stretched Cooper‟s ligaments cause an inferior lateral migration {{of the breast}} tissue. However, the current lingerie market predominantly revolves around bras designed for younger women that older women may feel are inappropriate for their physique. Literature regarding age-appropriate clothing has postulated that bras should be designed based on specific shapes, populations and usages. Yet the bra preferences of older women have been neglected in the literature. By determining women's requirements, the performance of current bras may be ascertained, and subsequent alterations may be recommended for bra design in order to optimise bras for older women if required. The aims of the current thesis were to: provide a wider understanding of the bra requirements of women aged 45 to 65 years, determine the key bra performance variables for this population, develop procedures to assess these variables and to determine the current appropriateness of {{a small sample of}} bras for this population. To achieve the research aims the thesis contained five studies. The first study was exploratory in nature, using focus groups and interviews to develop a knowledge base on the bra preferences of women aged 45 to 65 years. A survey was subsequently designed and implemented to determine the key bra performance variables among a wider sample of the population. The results of these studies identify the general dimensions that women consider when purchasing a bra (comfort, support, aesthetics, practicalities, and psychological aspects). From these dimensions, 11 key bra performance variables that are of importance to older women were derived (comfort, support, bra's ability to stay in place, appearance under clothes, silhouette, breast shape, breast <b>lift,</b> shoulder <b>straps,</b> discreetness, fabric and fit). Methods to quantify the key bra performance variables were required to assess the performance of current bras for older women. The third experimental study developed methods which minimised the limitations of existing procedures, and determined the validity and reliability of these methods. As a result of this study, methods to assess the 11 key bra performance variables were deemed acceptable for both objective and subjective measures. In the fourth study, two bras were selected from a popular and unpopular brand; the performance of these bras was assessed with regard to the 11 key bra performance variables. The results indicate that women aged 45 to 65 years preferred a bra that minimises breast kinematics, provides greater breast projection and lifts the breast sufficiently. Although differences lay between the bare breasted and bra conditions, the two bras performed similarly despite the difference in popularity. The final study incorporated a four week wearer trial to elucidate any changes in performance that may appear with increased usage. Subjective ratings of breast support and the bras' ability to stay in place were lower following the wearer trial. The bras tested performed well for the bra variables; comfort, fit, support and shoulder strap position. However, the remaining key bra performance variables may require alteration to ensure their appropriateness for women aged 45 to 65 years. It is concluded that women aged 45 to 65 years are generally cognisant of changes to their breasts as they age, subsequently seeking bras that are different from those they previously would have worn. The findings of this thesis suggest that alterations in bra design are required to optimise bras for older women. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
