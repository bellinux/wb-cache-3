40|$|International audienceSwollen {{softwood}} {{cellulose pulp}} in a DMAc/LiCl solvent system was compressed under elevated pressure (up to 900 MPa) in a Bridgman anvil press. The influence of high pressure on two cellulose systems was studied by measuring X-ray diffraction, mechanical and optical properties and observing scanning electron micrographs of the morphology. Compressed swollen cellulose, washed with distilled water, had lower elastic modulus and hardness compared to swollen cellulose washed {{with a combination}} of 2 -propanol and deionized water. This work showed that material with lower mechanical properties will be affected more by compression and will result in higher mechanical properties after pressure treatment. Transmitted light in the visible range for both systems was increased after elevated pressure was applied.

One way to mitigate the oversubscription problem is to use higher link capacity between the access <b>layer</b> and the <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> than that between servers and the access layer. However, oversubscription using the tree-based topology can still exist and result in the blocking server-to-server connectivity problem which can have severe performance impact on data centers due to increasing east-west traffic.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in buildings {{is one of}} the main strategies to reduce environmental impact of the building sector. This goal can be obtained not only reducing energy demand for heating and cooling, but also, for example, improving envelope performances. On the other hand, the new approaches to energy efficient design are not only moving in the direction of lower and lower U-values to achieve lower energy consumption, but also the development and use of natural and local building materials. This paper describes the results of a research aimed to design and assess a new layered envelope component that might be implemented on buildings of the Mediterranean area in order to improve the energy efficiency and the environmental sustainability. The designed layered envelope system is composed by a <b>layered</b> <b>core</b> panel and two dry claddings. Two Oriented Strand Board panels, a waterproof sheet of Kraft Paper and a thermal insulating panel, in turn, compose the <b>layered</b> <b>core</b> panel, which could be also used as a partition wall or as a component of envelope walls, floors and roofs. An objective was to use natural and local materials to develop a new thermal insulating material from renewable resources with comparable building physics and mechanical properties to commonly used insulations materials. Among the available natural materials, sheep wool was chosen since it represents a waste and for its good behaviour with heat, moisture and indoor air pollution. Several sample have been realized mixing sheep wool, at different granulometry, with lime in different weight percentages; for each sample, thermal tests have been performed by means of a heat flow meter. The U value, Yie, the mass and the time lag have been evaluated for the whole designed system according to the Italian standards. The Life Cycle Assessment has been carried out to compare the environmental impact of the designed system with a similar traditional product. Finally, by means of the Ecotect software, the efficiency of the envelope was evaluated simulating the replacement of an old structure of a factory with the system designed for wall retrofit and for roofing. The results was good in terms of energy balances of the building, while one of the main issue of the LCA study was the lack of data for local materials...|$|E

The stream functions for each layer such as core layer, intermediate layer, and peripheral layer are determined. The expressions for axial pressure gradient, interfaces, trapping, and reflux limits are obtained. The effects of power law index and viscosities on pressure across one wavelength, mechanical efficiency, and trapping are discussed numerically.

40|$|Recent results {{obtained}} from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft showed the surface of Mercury has high S abundances (approximately 4 wt%) and low Iron(II) Oxide abundances (less than 2 wt%). Based on these extreme values, the oxygen fugacity of Mercury's surface materials {{was estimated to be}} approximately 3 to 7 log(sub 10) units below the IW buffer (Delta IW- 3 to Delta IW- 7). This highly reducing nature of the planet has resulted in a large core and relatively thin mantle, extending to only approximately 420 km depth (corresponding to a core-mantle boundary pressure of approximately 4 - 7 GPa) within the planet. Furthermore, MESSENGER results have suggested the presence of carbon {{on the surface of the}} planet. Previous experimental results from have also suggested the possibility of a primary floatation crust on Mercury composed of graphite, produced after a global magma ocean event. With these exotic conditions of this compositional end-member planet, it begs the question, what is the core composition of Mercury? Although no definitive conclusion has been reached, previous studies have made advances towards answering this question. Riner et al. and Chen et al. looked at iron sulfide systems and implemented various crystallization and <b>layered</b> <b>core</b> scenarios to try and determine the composition and structure of Mercury's core. Malavergne et al. examined core crystallization scenarios in the presence of sulfur and silicon. Hauck et al. used the most recent geophysical constraints from the MESSENGER spacecraft to model the internal structure of Mercury, including the core, in a iron-sulfur-silicon system. More recently, Chabot et al. conducted a series of metal-silicate partitioning experiments in a iron-sulfur-silicon system. These results showed the core of Mercury has the potential to contain more than 15 wt% silicon. However, with the newest results from MESSENGER's low altitude campaign, carbon is another potential light element that could be incorporated into Mercury's core. The goal of this study is to determine the carbon concentration at graphite saturation in various silicon-iron bearing metals relevant to possible mercurian core compositions. Future experiments will include the addition of sulfur into these metals...|$|E

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{reservoirs}} {{are currently}} declining. Reservoirs are becoming depleted, and production needs {{to satisfy the}} demand and supply of hydrocarbons. For tight reservoirs such as shales, fracturing will become {{the main source of}} improving the permeability. It is therefore vital to conduct research into the behavior of fractures in the reservoir. The aim is to study how fractures develop in terms of fracture size, coalescence, patterns and in which dimensions they often occur. Often the importance of the behavior of these fractures and their contribution to flow in reservoirs also formed part of this research. In this investigation, the Posidonia shale core was examined using three different layering orientations. The three different layer orientated shale cores were subjected to axial loading in order to induce fracturing. These induced fractures were created in two ways. The first was by axial loading until the core reached maximum failure. The second involved loading in stages and scanning the core after each loading stage in the micro-CT scanner. This procedure was repeated until maximum failure was reached. An Indiana limestone core and sandstone core were also analyzed. The behavior, coalescence, frequently seen fracture patterns, angle with respect to the z-axis and apertures of the fractures were studied and compared. This was performed in both a quantitative and qualitative matter using the commercial Avizo® Fire software at TU Delft. A small part of this study touch on the modeling of the observed shear fracture pattern from a shale core preformed in Abaqus. The results from the fracture analyses shows that the largest fractures are seen in the shale cores, for which the fracture initiation was created by one loading stage until failure. Another observation shows that there is clear set of different fractures that is seen for each distinctive <b>layered</b> <b>core.</b> From the observed patterns a simple 2 D simulation is built in Abaqus. From the simulation is seen that for cracks under a certain angle, the master fracture is intersected by a 300 smaller fracture, the results in opening of the master fracture.

It consists of the media foundation pipeline, which has three components: Media Source, Media Sink and Media Foundation Transforms (MFT). A media source is an object that acts {{as the source of}} multimedia data, either compressed or uncompressed. It can encapsulate various data sources, like a file, or a network server or even a camcorder, with source specific functionality abstracted by a common interface. A source object can use a source resolver object which creates a media source from an URI, file or bytestream. Support for non-standard protocols can be added by creating a source resolver for them. A source object can also use a sequencer object to use a sequence of sources (a playlist) or to coalesce multiple sources into single logical source. A media sink is the recipient of processed multimedia data. A media sink can either be a renderer sink, which renders the content on an output device, or an archive sink, which saves the content onto a persistent storage system such as a file. A renderer sink takes uncompressed data as input whereas an archive sink can take either compressed or uncompressed data, depending on the output type. The data from media sources to sinks are acted upon by MFTs; MFTs are certain functions which transform the data into another form. MFTs can include multiplexers and demultiplexers, codecs or DSP effects like reverb. The <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> uses services like file access and networking and clock synchronization to time the multimedia rendering. These are part of the Platform layer, which provides services necessary for accessing the source and sink byte streams, presentation clocks and an object model that lets the <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> components function asynchronously, and is generally implemented as OS services.
