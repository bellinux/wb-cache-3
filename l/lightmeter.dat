50|$|The Minolta 5000, Minolta's {{entry level}} camera and {{essentially}} a downscaled 7000, {{was released in}} 1986. It featured shutter speeds of 1/2000 to 4 seconds and BULB, center-weighted <b>lightmetering,</b> exposure compensation of +1EV, flashsync speed of 1/100s and fully automatic programs.|$|R
50|$|GOST 2817-50 {{was similar}} to the ASA standard, having been based on a speed point at a density 0.2 above base plus fog, as opposed to the ASA's 0.1. GOST {{markings}} are only found on pre-1987 photographic equipment (film, cameras, <b>lightmeters,</b> etc.) of Soviet Union manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The Minolta 7000 was {{the first}} {{successful}} auto focus SLR using a motor integrated in the camera body.It was released in 1985 together with 11 lenses, 2 flashguns and a complete lineup of accessories.The 7000 featured one AF-sensor, shutter speeds of 1/2000 to 30 seconds, flash sync speed of 1/100s, exposure compensation of +/-4EV in 0.5 exposure steps, center-weighted <b>lightmetering</b> and two frames per second film advance. The Maxxum 7000, when first released had the crossed x's in the name Maxxum. Exxon had a registered trademark for the crossed x's and sued Minolta, forcing Minolta {{to change the way}} the name was shown.|$|R

5000|$|The Minolta 9000, {{a camera}} aimed at professionals, was {{released}} later the same year, and featured shutter speeds of 1/4000 to 30 seconds, center-weighted and spot <b>lightmetering,</b> exposure compensation of +-4EV in 0.5 exposure steps and a flash sync speed of 1/250s. Unlike the 7000, the 9000 had no internal motordrive and thus holds the {{position as the}} world's only autofocusing SLR with manual winding, but {{with the addition of}} the motor drive MD-90 a photographer could get up to 5 frames per second. The 9000 had a very extensive range of accessories, including several different backs, winding options and screens. The 9000 had a unique function in that, if combined with the Minolta Data Receiver DR-1000 and the Minolta Flash Meter IV, readings could be made on the flash meter and transferred wirelessly to the camera, and the camera then triggered from the flash meter.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{irradiance}} {{data are}} crucial to PV system performance analysis. Although <b>lightmeters</b> (or pyranometers) have been applied in utility-level solar farms, they are not economically feasible for commercial/residential-level solar sites. Publicly accessible data, such as meteorological satellite imagery, are potentially an ideal source to meet the emerging demand. This research applied satellite imagery processing and supervised learning algorithms to classify/quantity cloud absorption, and thereby predict solar irradiance. Prior Work In the past two decades, researches have been conducted on solving the satellite-to-radiance problem both commercially and academically. The handful published researches are either based on data-feed-intensive physical models or simple statistical models, and presented high variance (hourly bias 2. 5 %- 4. 5 %, hourly variance 20 %- 40 %, Polo et. 2008). Also, the commercial models are kept confidential to the public. This study aimed to apply machine learning classification and regression algorithms to explore and improve analytic approaches to solve this problem...|$|R

50|$|The Zorki 4 was {{possibly}} {{the most popular of}} all Zorki cameras, with 1,715,677 cameras made by the KMZ factory in Krasnogorsk, Russia. The Zorki 4 was also the first of the Zorki cameras to be exported in large numbers to the west. It is a fully manual camera, and does not have a <b>lightmeter.</b> An additional <b>lightmeter</b> may be added by the hot shoe.|$|E
50|$|Features {{include an}} {{integrated}} silicon photodiode TTL <b>lightmeter</b> which works from EV-2 to EV20. Only the <b>lightmeter</b> requires batteries to operate; {{the rest of}} the camera is fully mechanical, unlike the M7, and will operate without electricity. The camera's viewfinder is available with different magnifications of 0.58x, 0.72x and 0.85x and is improved to reduce flaring with multicoated glass elements and a condenser lens. The camera is also compatible with Leica Motor-M, Winder-M, Winder 4-P and Winder 4-2 motorised film winders and the Leicavit manual winder.|$|E
50|$|The camera has a {{built-in}} <b>lightmeter</b> using a CdS photocell mounted on the photographer's left-hand side; unlike later cameras, it does not meter through the taking lens. A lever switched between low sensitivity for bright subjects (EV 9-18) and high sensitivity for dark subjects (EV 1-10) (at ISO 100). Film speeds supported are ISO 10 through 800.|$|E
50|$|The G-III {{features}} a 40 mm 1.7 with six elements in four groups. The integrated <b>lightmeter</b> provides shutter priority and manual modes. The sensor {{is located on}} the forward part of the lens, which allows use of filters without manual compensation of exposure. The Canonet can use standard flashes, or the Canonlite D which was custom-designed for the Canonet.|$|E
50|$|The cameras {{allowed to}} focus the lens at maximum {{aperture}} to give a bright viewfinder image, then a switch at the side stops the lens down and switches on the metering which can be determined by a needle located {{on the side of}} the viewfinder. The use of stop-down light metering was at the time revolutionary, however it limited the capability of the <b>lightmeter</b> specially on low light situations.Later models Spotmatic F, Electro Spotmatic, ES, and ESII were capable of open-aperture metering when used with Super Multi Coated (S-M-C) Takumar lenses with an aperture coupling prong in the lens mount.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 1964 Spotmatic {{was one of}} {{the first}} SLRs on the market to offer a through-the-lens (TTL) exposure metering system. The camera was presented as a prototype at photokina 1960, and was originally designed to use spot metering. Shortly before production Asahi decided that spot metering would be too difficult to use, and so the metering system was altered to use center-weighted average metering.The change took place too close to production to change the name, and so Spotmatic stuck.The camera had a mechanical shutter with speed range from 1000 to 1 and Bulb. The <b>lightmeter</b> is activated by a lever on the side of the camera, which also stopped down the lens. Mercury battery (1.35 V Mallory RM640) was used to power the light metering system; however due to the way the circuit is designed, silver oxide batteries can be used instead.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the light intensity of selected light curing unit with varying distance and angulation of the light curing tip and <b>lightmeter.</b> Four types of light units; Spectrum 800 (Dentsply), Coltulux 3 (Coltene), Elipar FreeLight 2 (3 M Espe) and Starlight Pro (Mectron) were evaluated for light intensity at various distance between the light curing tip and the lightometer Cure Rite Denstply (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mm). The light curing units were angulated at 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees at a standardized 5 mm distance. The intensity of light curing is affected by the distance between the light curing tip and the <b>lightmeter.</b> However, the decrease in light intensity of the light curing unit was found not to obey the inverse square law for the distances 0 to 15 Mm. The study found that there was no significant difference between 45 degrees and 600 angulation between the light curing tip and the <b>lightmeter.</b> However, the decrease in light intensity is significant when compared to the light tip is placed perpendicular (90 degrees) to the aperture of the light meter. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the properties of reflective pipes, and the properties of light passing through them. It generally succeeded in determining the optimal properties of a piping system for getting light from point A to point B. Wider pipes transmit more light than thinner pipes, owing to the larger surface area inside them. Also, pipes which have an internal bend usually transmit more light than straight pipes when the incident light arrives at an angle, especially when this incident angle is close to that of the bend itself. Data collection and interpretation was impaired slightly by the main <b>lightmeter,</b> since its operative area is much smaller than all of the pipes that were tested. This could be addressed either {{with the aid of a}} photovoltaic panel, which has as large an area as one needs, or any other large <b>lightmeter,</b> if one could be located. The findings of this project would be best viewed as part of a larger project, one which includes both sunlight collection (or artificial light production) and light dispersion. The applications of Light Piping on its own are much more restricted than those of a comprehensive Light Management system. Also, longer lengths of pipe need to be tested to determine how feasible this type of system actually is for installation into structures. Funnels also should be tested...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the painterly {{tradition}} of the still life form Photographic Still Life expounds two aspects relating to our interaction with art objects. Firstly, that they are indeed objects and secondly that they demonstrate the ‘work’ of art, or rather that they are things that have a ‘thingly’ nature. For Heidegger, the things around us, including artworks within the current aesthetic paradigm, are rooted firmly within an established subject-object order that ‘enframes’ {{our understanding of the}} world as well as our encounters with art. By revealing the objects used to create the artworks as things like any other (the jug, the <b>lightmeter,</b> the camera) I hope to identify both the subject matter and the artworks themselves as objects in the world. Secondly, because our encounters with art cannot be defined within the existing subject-object dichotomy, it is their inherent ‘equipmentality’, their location within space and time, which constitutes their existence and our ontological relation to them...|$|E
40|$|Inpatient {{rooms in}} Dutch colonial {{heritage}} hospitals have some unique physical characteristics related to lighting, {{such as the}} height of the building structure and the use of terazzo for wall and floor finishing. These characteristics cause the atmosphere of the hospital to appear bleak since the amount of lighting illumination in the rooms is not fulfilled. The purpose of this research is to analyze and find solutions for optimal lighting design by taking the case of the upper-class wards in two Dutch colonial hospitals in Surabaya: the RS Darmo and the SSR St. Vincentius A Paulo. The first step is observation and measurement using <b>Lightmeter</b> LX- 103 to determine the amount of turning on the instrument room, followed by verification and simulation optimization using a computer program of DIALux v. 4. 6. The analysis showed that the lighting conditions on the wards at both hospitals have not met the optimum standards. Thus, {{there are several ways to}} optimize light levels, including: the replacement of materials and colors of the walls and floors with brighter colors, decreasing the ceiling height using a drop ceiling, replacement of the colors of the furniture with brighter colors, and the use of 28 - 36 W fluorescent lamp and soft white 26 W down lighting...|$|E
40|$|A {{promising}} and novel {{solar concentrator}} design has been thoroughly investigated and optimised. A prototype concentrator {{based on this}} novel geometry was validated using ray tracing techniques. This ray tracing demonstrated the comparative performance of this novel concentrator in regards to equivalent parabolic dishes. The effect of mirror surface normal errors on performance was established using Monte-Carlo based ray tracing code, which agreed well with the optical performance of this prototype which was determined experimentally. 	 A need for low-cost solar cookers to replace bio-mass worldwide was identified, and the concentrator design was then developed as a low-cost solar oven. Despite existing in some number, no current design is able to achieve high performance at low-cost. An industrial partner, Dytecna, was initially {{involved in the process}} of this development of the system as a solar cooker. In support of a field trial for the solar cooker developed with Dytecna, a detailed thermal model of the oven was developed. A low-cost <b>lightmeter</b> was constructed and calibrated in order to measure the direct normal irradiance during the field trial in Italy. Laboratory work provided baseline results for the heating of various thermal masses in the oven. The Italian field trials provided a wealth of feedback into the design of the system and many valuable results. The solar cooker was able to bring 0. 75 L of water to the boil in 33 minutes with an average heat throughput of 203 W. Important benchmark results and practical experience of several competing receiver materials was obtained; further lab testing provided more accurate measurements of the receivers' performances. The experiences of the Italian field trial were fed back into the design of a subsequent prototype, intended for a much larger field trial in Tanzania. Improvements in the hotplate, receiver material, and the oven were all incorporated into the design. Additionally, the structure of the solar cooker was redesigned to incorporate a low-cost wooden construction. Supporting work was conducted for the month long trial in which 8 solar cookers would be distributed to families in Tanzania. The field trial in Tanzania provided a wealth of user feedback into the design. At the same time the new solar cooker exceeded previously established performances in Italy. The new design was able to provide an average of 246 W of heat to 1 kg of water, which was brought to boiling point in 25 minutes. This represents a heating efficiency of 66 % compared to the incident solar flux on the hotplate. In response to findings during the Tanzanian trials, further laboratory work was conducted into establishing the reflectivities of low-cost candidate mirror materials. Throughout all phases of the project the design of the solar cooker was refined and improved with the goal of a solar cooker design that could reach price-point, performance, and usability standards which would ensure market success. </p...|$|E
