40|$|We have {{developed}} a probabilistic algorithm for improved error recovery {{in a system of}} concurrent processes. Simulations for various lengths of checkpoint intervals have shown that in most cases the probabilistic method is more cost effective than the iterative rollback method. However, implementation of the probabilistic algorithm requires knowledge of the distribution function of the <b>latency</b> <b>times</b> between error occurrence and error detection. In this paper, we present a method for obtaining an approximate empirical distribution function for the <b>latency</b> <b>times</b> using the iterative rollback method. The cost effectiveness of the probabilistic method, when based on the approximate distribution function, is investigated for various parameters (number of data points collected, length of error interval).

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the phytochemical profile and anti-nociception activity of root crude extracts of D. niccolifera, a plant {{commonly used to}} alleviate painful conditions by local communities. Standard phytochemical screening tests revealed presence of tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, reducing sugars, cardiac glycosides and anthraquinones. Anti-nociception was assessed using the hot plate model on Swiss Albino mice. Mice intraperitoneally injected with root crude extract showed that the D. niccolifera root extract had analgesic activity by taking longer {{to react to the}} thermal stimulus than the control group.

These <b>latency</b> <b>times</b> were found to be significantly different (p< 0. 05) from the control. The anti-nociception activity may be attributed to the phenolic compounds in the extract.

50|$|A usual {{precursor}} to ejaculation is the sexual arousal of the male, {{leading to the}} erection of the penis, though not every arousal nor erection leads to ejaculation. Penile sexual stimulation during masturbation or vaginal, anal, oral, or non-penetrative sexual activity may provide the necessary stimulus {{for a man to}} achieve orgasm and ejaculation. With regard to intravaginal ejaculation <b>latency</b> <b>time,</b> men typically reach orgasm 5-7 minutes after the start of penile-vaginal intercourse, taking into account their desires and those of their partners, but 10 minutes is also a common intravaginal ejaculation <b>latency</b> <b>time.</b> A prolonged stimulation either through foreplay (kissing, petting and direct stimulation of erogenous zones before penetration during intercourse) or stroking (during masturbation) leads to an adequate amount of arousal and production of pre-ejaculatory fluid. While the presence of sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid is thought to be rare, sperm from an earlier ejaculation, still present in the urethra, may be picked up by pre-ejaculatory fluid. In addition, infectious agents (including HIV) often can be present in pre-ejaculate.|$|E
