5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited.

5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents.

5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income.

5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. As he began to redraw his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
