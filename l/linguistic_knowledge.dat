25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Chomsky {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} I-language and E-language, similar but not identical to the competence/performance distinction. [...] "I-language" [...] refers to internal language and is contrasted with external language (or E-language). I-language is taken to be the object of study in linguistic theory; it is the mentally represented <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> that a native speaker of a language has, and is therefore a mental object [...] from this perspective, most of theoretical linguistics is a branch of psychology. E-language encompasses all other notions of what a language is, for example {{that it is a}} body of knowledge or behavioural habits shared by a community. Thus, E-language is not itself a coherent concept, and Chomsky argues that such notions of language are not useful in the study of innate <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> i.e., competence, even though they may seem sensible and intuitive, and useful in other areas of study. Competence, he argues, can only be studied if languages are treated as mental objects.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a system to solve a {{language}} game, called Guillotine, which requires a player with a strong cultural and <b>linguistic</b> background <b>knowledge.</b> The player observes a set of five words, generally unrelated to each other, and in one minute she has to provide a sixth word, semantically connected to the others.

The main motivation for designing an artificial player for Guillotine is the challenge of providing the machine with the cultural and <b>linguistic</b> background <b>knowledge</b> which makes it similar to a human being, with the ability of interpreting natural language documents and reasoning on their content. Experiments carried out showed promising results, and both the knowledge source modeling and the reasoning mechanisms (implementing a spreading activation algorithm to find out the solution) seem to be appropriate.

2500|$|Non-deterministic {{approaches}} in language studies are largely {{inspired by the}} work of Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, in functionalist linguistic theory, which argues that competence is based on performance.

To the extent that <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> is constituted by experience with language, grammar is argued to be probabilistic and variable rather than fixed and absolute. [...] This conception of grammar as probabilistic and variable follows from the idea that one's competence changes in accordance with one's experience with language.

2500|$|European {{study of}} the region {{formerly}} known as [...] "the Orient" [...] had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was {{an important factor in}} the Middle Ages. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by imperialist attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the history of ideas in the West, called [...] "Orientalism". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{original}} works was On the Letters (О писмєньхъ) by Chernorizets Hrabar, where he defended the Cyrillic alphabet against its Byzantine Greek critics and proved not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the Greek alphabet arguing that the Greek letters were neither the oldest known to man, nor divine. In the form of rhetoric questions and answers On the Letters demonstrated excellent historic and <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Chernorizets Hrabar, as he indicated that [...] "God did not first create the Hebrew or the Greek language, but Syrian which Adam spoke..." [...] and underlined that [...] "Before then the Greeks had no alphabet of their own but wrote their speech with Phoenician letters." [...] Constantine of Preslav and John the Exarch combined translated and adapted Byzantine works with original texts. The latter compiled the Shestodnev (Шестоднев – Hexameron) that included valuable first-hand evidence about the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I. Constantine of Preslav's Didactic Gospel was the first systematic work treating sermons in Slavic literature that also featured the poetic preface Azbuchna molitva (Азбучна молитва – Alphabet Prayer), the first original poetry in Bulgarian language. Later, Cosmas the Priest wrote the anti-Bogomil treatise Sermon Against the Heretics which apart from the theological arguments contained criticism on the contemporary Bulgarian society, with particular attention to religious and social issues.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, Chomsky has {{maintained}} that syntactic knowledge {{is at least}} partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting {{that there is an}} enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> they attain (see: [...] "poverty of the stimulus" [...] argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the language acquisition device (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute [...] "universal grammar".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Chomsky {{introduced}} two central ideas {{relevant to}} the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories. The first was the distinction between competence and performance. Chomsky noted the obvious fact that people, when speaking in the real world, often make linguistic errors (e.g., starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through). He argued that these errors in linguistic performance were ir{{relevant to the}} study of linguistic competence (the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences). Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, greatly simplifying linguistic analysis (see the [...] "Grammaticality" [...] section below). The second idea related directly to the evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> is mentally represented. For Chomsky, the nature of such mental representations is largely innate, so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy it must be able to explain the various grammatical nuances of the languages of the world as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language. Chomsky argued that, even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively adequate grammars, progress in terms of descriptive adequacy will only come if linguists hold explanatory adequacy as their goal. In other words, real insight into the structure of individual languages can only be gained through comparative study {{of a wide range of}} languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.|$|E
2500|$|Pedagogical content {{knowledge}} {{is understood as}} the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the {{content knowledge}} as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater {{to the needs of}} their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific knowledge domain, we can turn to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” [...] initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the <b>linguistic</b> <b>knowledge</b> progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [...] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language [...] that include {{but are not limited to}} syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [...] subject area” [...] these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. [...] The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps [...] as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.|$|E
40|$|In {{a seminal}} article, Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard & Sedivy (1995) showed that eye-movements to {{real-world}} objects reflect a rapid interplay of utterance and visual environments in sentence comprehension. Further, Kamide, Scheepers & Altmann (2003) {{found that when}} <b>linguistic</b> and world <b>knowledge</b> constrain the domain of reference in a visual scene, people even anticipate as yet unmentioned arguments/referents. Studies by Knoeferle, Crocker, Scheepers & Pickering (2003) have since revealed that when <b>linguistic</b> and world <b>knowledge</b> did not disambiguate an initial syntactic and role ambiguity, depicted agent-action-patient events permitted anticipation of thematic role-fillers online. This paper opposes <b>linguistic</b> and world <b>knowledge</b> on the one hand, and visual scenes {{on the other hand}} in order to determine their relative importance in auditory comprehension. We observed a preferred reliance of auditory sentence comprehension processes on information that had to be extracted from depicted event scenes. Determining the nature and time-course of the interaction between linguistic/world knowledge and visual scenes is a first step towards developing a model of real-time auditory sentence comprehension in visual environments. Our finding has implications for theories of the language faculty (e. g., Jackendoff, 2002) ...|$|R

The dialect identification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region.

According to these analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID).
