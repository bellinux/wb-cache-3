40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The forest {{products}} industry often uses intermediate-support <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> systems to transport logs from the harvest site to a staging area. A method {{is presented to}} assist in the analysis and design of these cable systems. The method determines tensions in individual cables, forces on and stresses in the support trees, and the geometry of the system under load. Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. A good, automated initial guess for the unknown quantities, based on the physics of the problem, is provided. A model of an example intermediate support <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> system is analyzed by the proposed approach and the resulting behavior discussed. The method includes the effects of catenary sag and elastic stretch in the cables, and elastic behavior in the support trees. Friction is ignored in the formulation. The catenary and elastic stretch methodologies for the cables are each demonstrated on a single cable span as well as on a demonstration cable system. The effect of the support tree flexibility and cable mass are found to be significant on the response of the <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> system.

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> {{will become}} more {{important}} as harvesting shifts to greater annual proportions on steep terrain in New Zealand. The costs of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> are considerably {{higher than that of}} conventional ground-based methods. Improving cost-effectiveness has been identified as key to ensuring the forestry industry remains cost competitive in the international market. This thesis focuses on ways to better understand and improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> methods by specifically focusing on rigging configurations. The investigation was conducted through a comprehensive literature review, an industry survey to establish current use and preferences, a Delphi survey with experts to establish actual advantages and disadvantages, scale model testing to establish some fundamental knowledge of tension to deflection relationship, and finally a series of targeted case studies to establish both productivity and skyline tension in actual operations. Each of these aspects of the research topic employed different methodology. The literature review highlighted the most relevant research relating to <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> world-wide spanning nearly a century. Various research papers, manuals, books and computer software were summarized. While many aspects of cable yarding operations have been investigated, much of it focusing on various aspects of operational efficiency through case studies, there is very limited information with regard to rigging configurations. The survey of 50 <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> practitioners determined what rigging configurations were commonly used in New Zealand. It includes their perceived advantages and disadvantages for varying levels of deflection, but also for specific scenarios such as pulling away from native forest boundaries and flying logs over a stream. Results showed that there were many conflicting perceptions about rigging configuration options. Using an expert panel, a Delphi process was used to derive consensus on what advantages were truly unique to each configuration. This allowed the longer lists of perceived advantages from the industry survey to be pared down to a concise list of ad/disadvantages that will be used in the updating of the Best Practice Guidelines for <b>Cable</b> <b>Logging.</b> To increase our fundamental understanding of tension / payload / deflection relationships, an experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. Using a model yarder in a lab and continuous tension and video recording devices, the dynamic skyline behavior of three similar configurations were tested: North Bend, South Bend and Block in the Bight. The tensions were compared by use of a two-way analysis of variance, which indicated configuration and choker length were significant variables in some but not all of the dynamic load tests. Results also showed that some configurations performed better than others in minimizing the shock loads due to dropping into full suspension, impact with ground objects, and breakout during bridling. Finally, a series of eight studies were conducted on targeted logging operations where relevant stand and terrain parameters were related to the continuous skyline tension monitoring, and recording of productivity through time study. The three targeted configurations included (1) North Bend, (2) Standing skyline using a motorized slack-pulling carriage and (3) a live skyline using a motorized grapple carriage. Results showed that peak and average tensions, as well as amplification factors and the payload to tension relationship, varied between configurations. The study also showed that tensions could be collected to compute measures of payload and tension efficiency, which provided insight into operational performance. The safe working load was exceeded in 53 % of all cycles studied and across seven of eight study sites and 14 of 16 spans. Cycle times were significantly different between rigging configurations and that production information could be used to compute measures of labor and energy consumption as well as payload and tension efficiency; which also provide insight into operational performance. The industry should give serious consideration to the use of tension monitors. Tension monitors have many benefits and have the potential to improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations in New Zealand. Monitoring tensions can help one learn new techniques or methods (i. e. rigging configurations), help improve payload analysis software for future planning and help evaluate new technology and machinery...|$|R

One of the chief aims of production logging tools is to eliminate the small-scale non-homogeneity principals of <b>cable</b> <b>logs.</b> Moreover, it calibrates their homogeneity extremity. This technique could enroll as depth interval detection in those layers which have more permeability regarding immediate alterations in the well flow logs. Therefore, these inefficiencies may not be illustrated by core plugs and <b>cable</b> <b>logs.</b> The most extraordinary appeal of production logging tools is to obtain the appropriate vertical dispersion of the reservoir layers, which helps to the accurate explanation of flow units in the reservoir. In the areas with a low volume of flow rate or low productivity index, {{it would not be}} preferred to utilize production logging tools instead of core analysis.

40|$|The {{comercial}} thinning of second-growth {{stands in}} the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly important for satisfying the demand for timber. <b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> will require the rigging of smaller intermediate support trees rather than those utilized on old-growth timber sales. This paper reports {{on the results of}} a study designed to evaluate the ability of second-growth trees to sustain the compressive forces similar to those generated by a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> system. The movements of nine trees subjected to increasing amounts of force were measured with two theodolites. The conditions of loading were similar to those imposed on intermediate support trees. The study demonstrates that a tree will continue to move in the direction of its initial lateral movement. Once a tree is bent, the downward compressive force governs the movement of the tree. The results from the study are compared to Euler's design formula. It is suggested that a factor of safety be applied when designing an intermediate support.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The Appalachian {{mountain}} region lends itself ideally to <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations. However, very few new <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> contractors that have started {{over the last}} two decades have been successful in sustaining their operation. The absence of advanced planning, contract management, lack of skilled labor and labor turnover issues has led to inefficient operations that cannot survive financially. A productivity study was carried out on one new Thunderbird TY 45 operation to document the effect of professional training on the production efficiency. The productivity of the operation after a month of self-learning was established at 18. 8 tons per productive machine hour at an average piece size of 1. 25 tons and 120 meter extraction distance. The crew then received one full week of professional training from two experienced Pacific Northwest riggers. Two weeks after the training the average productivity increased to 23. 7 tons per productive machine hour. The main factors were a reduction in carriage out and in times, as well as increased average turn volume. Considerable improvements in line shifts, landing organization and safety were also observed. For this case study, the expense of professional training will be paid off in four working weeks...|$|R

The goals of the survey were to set a general reference for <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> rates, to identify eventual differences between countries and {{to determine the effect}} of technical work parameters (i. e. piece size, removal per hectare, line length) on actual contract rates. With a total sample size of 566 units, the mean removal and rate were 165 m 3 ha– 1 and 42. 9 € m– 3, respectively.

40|$|A {{research}} {{trial was}} conducted in Victoria, Australia, to evaluate a self-levelling feller- -buncher on steep terrain and its potential to improve the overall productivity of steep terrain <b>cable</b> <b>logging.</b> The production study was conducted for a mechanized harvesting system using a Valmet 445 EXL self-levelling tracked feller-buncher and a Madill 124 swing yarder while operating in a clear fell plantation. This study quantified the equipment productivity of steep slope harvesting in a 33 year-old Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) plantation. Mechanized felling {{was an integral part}} of this operation, although there were areas of motor- manually felled trees due to terrain and stream restrictions. Thus the difference in productivity of the yarder for bunched and unbunched trees was quantified. For an average piece size of 0. 8 m^ 3, a productivity of 138 m^ 3 /PMH was predicted for the feller-buncher. Bunching substantially improved the productivity of the swing yarder. Mean volume per cycle for the swing yarder was 1. 9 m^ 3 for bunched trees versus 1. 3 m^ 3 for unbunched trees. For a yarding distance range between 150 and 240 metres, bunching increased the productivity by 25 %. These results show the potential of self-levelling feller-bunchers in <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations and suggest that research into mechanised felling be directed towards acquiring more information on the performance of steep terrain feller-bunchers in larger trees sizes, and under other slope and soil conditions in Australia.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of cable-based yarding systems {{has been studied}} extensively, resulting in numerous work productivity models (i. e. models predicting the ratio between output and time). Productivity models are used in both research and operations management, but are laborious to develop.

Therefore, work productivity models developed in recent years were compiled, with the aim of increasing their visibility, accessibility and comparability to potential users and other interested parties. This compilation should facilitate comparisons and evaluations of the models and their influential parameters, and the synthesis of existing models. A systematic review of the international scientific literature on <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> published between 2000 and 2011 was performed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Designing timber {{harvesting}} units is a challenging task. The task requires decision making on logging equipment, landing site, cable road profile, road location, and transportation system. Traditionally forest planners {{have done the}} task manually. However, the manual method {{makes it difficult to}} examine many alternatives and the harvest plans depend heavily on the experience of the individual planners. Furthermore, increased environmental concerns require more sophisticated planning procedures. Thus, it is challenging to find not only economically and environmentally "feasible" solutions but also "good" solutions by the manual method. Tools for detailed analysis and systematic evaluation of alternatives become essential for better planning of harvesting operations. This study develops a methodology with the purpose of assisting the planners in designing <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> unit layout. The methodology combines a <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operation planning problem with a road network planning problem and optimizes them simultaneously. It incorporates modem computer software languages, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, and optimization techniques that have become available during the last two decades. The methodology includes logging feasibility and cost analysis to evaluate alternative cable roads and yarding equipment. Once the feasible cable road alternatives are identified, the methodology formulates two cost minimization network problems. The networks represent variable and fixed costs associated with yarding and truck transportation activities to move logs from the stump to the mill. The methodology uses a heuristic network algorithm as an optimization technique to solve the network problems. One of the two cost minimization network problems is for <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operation planning and the other is for truck transportation planning. Each of the network problems is solved separately using the heuristic network algorithm while being connected to the other by a feedback mechanism. The methodology is implemented in a computerized model that {{can be used as a}} decision support system. The model is applied to an actual harvest area of 93 ha. A total of 40 candidate landing locations with 2, 880 cable roads from 2 yarding equipment alternatives were evaluated. The model found 1, 719 feasible cable road alternatives by conducting the logging feasibility and cost analysis. Two cost minimization network problems were developed. A total of 141, 139 links and 1, 926 timber parcels were developed in the network problem for <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> paths. In the network for solving road location problem, a total of 95, 904 links were developed to connect 13, 522 grid cells included in the planning area. After 47. 2 hours for 10 repetitions on Pentium HI 1 GHz speed desktop computer, the heuristic network algorithm solved these network problems and selected a total of 19 landings and 155 cable roads to harvest 8, 064 m³ of logs from 1, 926 timber parcels over the planning area. A total of 2. 85 kilometers of new access roads were proposed as a part of the solution for this application. Overall yarding and road costs for timber harvest in the planning area was 416, 675 (5 1. 67 /m³). Although the exact solution could not be verified, the solution obtained with this methodology when coupled with sensitivity analysis can be considered as a feasible and good harvest operation plan for the management goals. By providing systematic and analytic tools, the computerized model presented in this study can be used as a decision support tool assisting the forest planners in designing timber harvest layout...|$|R

SC II was a variation of this with a two man crew operation. SC III was operating radio controlled chokers there was a two man crew (choker setter and carriage operator). The study aims to assess how operations in Ireland perform against previous known cable studies {{to determine whether the}} cost of timber extraction on remote forest sites inaccessible for mechanised felling, has a future given the increased demand for wood fibre in Ireland, both from the sawmilling industries and the wood for energy sector. The volume per PMH was recorded at 17. 97 for SC I, 15. 09 for SC II and 20. 58 m 3 for SC III. The difference in productivity versus SC III remote controlled chokers is 5. 49 m 3 /PMH for SC II crew and 2. 61 m 3 /PMH for SC I. The decrease in total volume extracted from SCs I and II versus SC III was recorded at 15. 69 m 3 (15 %) and 32. 97 m 3 (36 %) product respectively. In value terms, the unit cost (€/m 3) varied from 6. 29 (SC I) to 6. 43 (SC II) to 4. 57 (SC III).

Production rates, expressed in cubic metres per hour and production cost, expressed in dollars per cubic metre were derived using the model to simulate cable yarding under set conditions. Values for the production rate and cost {{were obtained from the}} simujation of three machines; a Koller K- 300, a Timbermaster and a Hadjil 071, all rigged as standing skylines on uphill settings and using intermediate supports. Results obtained by the simulation runs are presented showing the variation of total average costs per cubic metre, with slope distance of the setting and the variation of production per hour against slope distance. For each machine an optimal landing spacing and slope distance was identified for operations in forests of given average thinning piece size. Management implications and alternative harvesting strategies are discussed concerning the introduction and use of such machines to <b>cable</b> <b>log</b> this forest type...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting {{operations}} in Turkey are performed using traditional methods employing mostly animals and manpower for skidding and tractors mainly for winching. To apply these methods efficiently, the trees {{have to be}} bucked into short lengths logs (3 - 4 m), which reduces log values and overall profits. To produce longer logs, aerial harvesting methods such as <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> and helicopter logging could be implemented, especially in productive forests located in steep mountainous regions of Turkey. Almost all of the forests in Turkey are state forests and managed by the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF). The GDF uses helicopters in firefighting activities; however, helicopters have not been used in harvesting operations. Using helicopters in both firefighting and harvesting may increase the utilization rate of helicopters and reduce the average helicopter unit cost. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the factors affecting the cost and productivity of helicopter logging and to analyze the utilization of helicopter logging in Turkish forestry...|$|R
