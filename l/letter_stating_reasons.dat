40|$|Draft of {{a letter}} from Carl Linnaeus fil. to Nicolaas Laurens Burman (1734 – 1793). Linnaeus fil. feels {{overwhelmed}} and ashamed to start this <b>letter</b> and <b>states</b> the <b>reasons</b> of his negligence. He has been distracted these years by various things, firstly his duties as demonstrator, secondly his second office, that of professor, and thirdly his travels through South Sweden and Skåne. He has published his second decade of plants, which Burman can get from Schultz's. Mentions Johan Peter Falk (1733 – 1774). He wishes he had more plants to describe, especially those from Europe, even the commonest. Comments on the many plants names and their synonyms, mentioning Caspar Bauhin's "Pinax". Finishes with a special mention for Italian botanists. On the last page, written upside down, are introductory words {{to a series of}} lectures, concerning the foundations of natural history...|$|R
40|$|This book {{presents}} a critical {{edition of the}} Latin letters in ms. G 3 (Uppsala University Library) from Johannes Annorelius to his brother. Johannes Annorelius left Sweden as a young student {{in the beginning of}} the 18 th century and settled down in Flanders, where he converted to the Catholic faith and became a Capuchin friar. In the Capuchin friary Annorelius wrote several extensive letters in French and Latin to his brother Julius in Sweden. The <b>letters</b> <b>state</b> the <b>reasons</b> for his conversion and are intended to convince his Lutheran brother and the rest of their family to become Catholics as well. Hence, the letters become epistolary specimens of controversial theology with arguments mostly from the Bible and the Church Fathers in a style highly influenced by the controversialists of the Counter-reformation. We find a Neo-Latin text presenting a scholastic argumentation in a spirit representative of the time. In a unique way the present letter collection reflects the great European confessional warfare in the mirror of two brothers from the village of Tierp in Sweden. The major part of the book (267 pp.) consists of the edition of the letters. An introduction supplies with information about Johannes Annorelius, about his style and influences, and about his language. At the end of the book follow indices of persons and countries, doctrinal matters, and groups of persons, who in Annorelius? opinion are to be considered heretics...|$|R

Within days of the article's publication, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society submitted a formal request for disassociation, removing all association with the United Nations Department of Public Information, and released a <b>letter</b> <b>stating</b> that the <b>reason</b> for becoming associated with the United Nations Department of Information (DPI) was to access their facilities, and that they had not been aware of the change in language contained in the criteria for NGO association. However, when the Watch Tower Society sought NGO association, [...] "the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations", acknowledging that the purpose of membership is to [...] "promote knowledge of the principles and activities of the United Nations." ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{national}} Department of Health strongly advocates {{the strengthening}} of primary health care systems, and recommendations for appropriate level of care referrals exist. Very few published data on the scope of current ambulatory specialised psychiatric hospital services in South Africa are currently available, {{making it difficult to}} assess whether these recommendations are being followed. As a starting point, an audit was conducted to obtain a profile of new non-urgent general adult patients seen at Stikland Hospital with a view to evaluating system needs and demands. Methods. The folders of 103 consecutively seen patients were selected for retrospective review. Patient demographic, referral and assessment information was entered into a single database. Descriptive statistics were compiled with reference to the above variables using SPSS. Results. Overall 58. 3 % of referrals were from the private sector. More than a third (36. 7 %) of referral <b>letters</b> <b>stated</b> no clear <b>reason</b> for referral and 41. 7 % no psychiatric diagnosis, and 29. 1 % of patients were referred without psychotropic medication being started. On assessment 62. 1 % of patients were found to have a single Axis I diagnosis. Despite virtually no referral letters making any mention of them, substance use disorders (30. 1 %), personality traits/disorders (35. 9 %) and co-morbid medical illness (36. 7 %) were commonly found on assessment. Conclusions. A significant portion of the patients in our sample could have been managed at primary care level and were referred prematurely. The overall quality of referral letters was poor, and they lacked vital information required for appropriate pre-assessment decision making. Undergraduate training focusing on these skills should be intensified, and consideration should be given to incorporating aspects of our findings into primary health care updates...|$|R

5000|$|Over the years, Irving's {{stance on}} the Holocaust changed significantly. From 1988, he started to espouse Holocaust denial openly; he had {{previously}} not denied the Holocaust outright and for this reason, many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him. They admired Irving for the pro-Nazi slant in his work {{and the fact that}} he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked, but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust. In 1980, Lucy Dawidowicz noted that although Hitler's War was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich, because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust, that his book was not part of the [...] "anti-Semitic canon". In 1980, Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust-denial conference, which he refused under the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation. In a <b>letter,</b> Irving <b>stated</b> his <b>reasons</b> for his refusal as: [...] "This is pure Realpolitik on my part. I am already dangerously exposed, and I cannot take the chance of being caught in flak meant for others!" [...] Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review (IHR), he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States. Robert Jan van Pelt suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus.|$|R
