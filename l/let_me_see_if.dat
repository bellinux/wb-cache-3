60|$|Just. Now, Bridget, {{hold your}} tongue, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> my horrid {{situation}} be apparent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} the three duels all at once, and the three valets? Oh! what fun it is. But do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> d'Artagnan got the diamonds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace," [...] I said, for I {{feared that}} blood would be shed. [...] "Peace, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> my snake {{will tell me}} where the cattle are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Molly. I hope you'll {{tell your}} little recruit {{that the first}} and {{foremost}} duty of a good policeman is to obey orders. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see,</b> then, <b>if</b> I can enlighten you a bit." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (Poor <b>me,</b> Llorona, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> weep to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> by weeping, Llorona, {{my heart}} can rest.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can hunt up this Carlos Martine. I can {{at least}} have a talk with him, and learn how matters stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, little dear," [...] {{said that}} lady. [...] "Come and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you are cold and damp: come {{and let me}} warm you at the fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{justice is}} often unjust enough!" [...] cried the Vampire; [...] "and ply thy legs, mighty Raja; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> thou canst reach the sires-tree before I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! of course!" [...] assented the man heartily. [...] "I don't {{want to keep}} anybody's money--not if I know it is theirs. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{there is}} a card in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{thought you}} might meet the happy woman in my life-time, I said to you, 'Tell me of it--and I promise {{to tell her that}} she has only to wait.' Time must pass, Ernest, before it can be needful to perform my promise. But you might <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> her. <b>If</b> you find her in the gallery to-morrow, you might bring her here." ...|$|R
60|$|L. Du Lake. 'Tis a {{great way}} to the bottom; but heaven is all-sufficient to give me {{strength}} for it. [Drinks it up.] Why, God's blessing on your heart, son Trice! I hope 'tis no offence to call you son? hem!--hem!--Son Loveby, I think my son Trice and I are much of the same years: <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see,</b> son, <b>if</b> nature be utterly extinct in you: Are you ticklish, son Trice? [Tickles him.|$|R
60|$|I told her, that if {{she would}} take my advice, I would tell her how she should obtain her wishes in both those things, and that I would engage I would bring the man to her door again, and make him beg to be let in. She smiled at that, and soon <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see,</b> that <b>if</b> he came to her door, her resentment was not so great as to give her leave to let him stand long there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] she said. [...] "I {{approve of}} {{everything}} you did. But sit down, now, and don't keep walking that way, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I understand it perfectly. Of course, I {{had to have}} my say out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they are}} not alike except in looks. Her form and face are {{identical}} with Lucy's. I was so sure that I begged her to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> there was a scar on her left arm; but she refused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eleven. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see,</b> <b>if</b> {{she keeps}} up that gait, we'll sight Mangareva between eight and nine o'clock {{tomorrow}} morning. I'll have {{her on the}} beach by ten or by eleven at latest. And then your troubles will be all over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will give}} me time for atonement?" [...] I pleaded. [...] "You will not lose all {{confidence}} in <b>me?</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you again, <b>if</b> it is only to show that I am not quite unworthy of your pardon--at your own time; {{in the presence of}} another person, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, at least," [...] said Mrs. Shelby, [...] "could not {{you give}} me some little insight into yours; {{a list of all}} your debts, at least, and of all that is owed to you, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> try and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can't help you to economize." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{the butler}} at Mrs. Rheinholdt's say that Craig {{belonged to a}} servants' club up town? I know the place well. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can't join {{and pick up a}} little {{information}} about the man. He must have a night out sometimes. Let's find out what he does. How's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "it's no good {{thinking}} about that, is it? I've {{wanted to give}} you this for ages, darling; it IS so uncomfortable on my finger. Now, just <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can pop it on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Miss Starbrow, please don't think that. Wait {{a minute}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can {{remember}} how that was," [...] said the poor curate. [...] "I think I said that all present at the table except myself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{off your}} coat and sit down, Will, and don't look so angry at me. I know that you're not greedy, well enough. Tell {{me what you}} are going to do, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{mother was}} {{enforcing}} this assurance, {{when the little}} girl's sobs burst out {{in spite of her}} sister, who had been trying to console her. 'It is Celestina Mary,' she cried, pointing to three dolls whom she had carried in clasped to her breast. 'Poor Celestina Mary! She is left behind, and Ellen won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> she is in the carriage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was really}} enraged with them. [...] "The facts are enough for me," [...] I said. [...] "We {{know he is}} innocent. Why is his innocence not proved? It ought to be, it must be, it shall be! If the Trial tell me it can't be done, I refuse to believe the Trial. Where is the book, Major? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> for myself <b>if</b> his lawyers have left nothing for his wife to do. Did they love him as I love him? Give me the book!" ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the fresh}} air my senses {{gradually}} came back to me, and I began to understand why it was I {{could not see the}} cow. The reason was that the house was between us. By some mysterious process I had been discharged into the back garden. I still had the milking-stool in my hand, but the cow no longer troubled <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> her <b>see</b> <b>if</b> she could wake Veronica by merely bellowing outside the door; it was more than I had ever been able to do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so. I'm {{afraid it}} is. Only, just <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> she is all right. Ay!' and then, after a gaze, a fond touch or two, an irrepressible sigh strangled in the midst, 'lock her up again! You ain't {{by any chance}} going home to-morrow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{wish you}} happiness, {{because you have}} found it," [...] he said. [...] "Wise and {{wonderful}} people! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> your coffee is what I should expect, Nora," [...] he went on. [...] "To tell you the truth, I have had rather a disturbed breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thinking you a mad monkey, {{and that}} your keeper," [...] said Marian, looking proudly at the {{handsome}} face and dancing black eyes of her beautiful brother. [...] "Why! how you are grown, Gerald! Do stand up, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you are not taller than I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Or perhaps,' said Clemency, running {{past her}} husband, and {{catching}} in her emotion at Mr. Warden's cloak, 'perhaps she's here now; perhaps she's close by. I think from your manner she is. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> her, sir, <b>if</b> you please. I waited on {{her when she}} was a little child. I saw her grow to be the pride of all this place. I knew {{her when she was}} Mr. Alfred's promised wife. I tried to warn her when you tempted her away. I know what her old home was when she was like the soul of it, and how it changed when she was gone and lost. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> speak to her, if you please!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not wounded!" [...] exclaimed Ulf, who overheard the words, but {{misunderstood}} their application, [...] "not wounded! Why, Erling, {{where have}} thy wits gone? The man is wellnigh dead from loss of blood. See, his jerkin is soaking. Bring hither bandages; come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> the wound. <b>If</b> {{the old man}} has indeed saved Ulfstede this day, eternal disgrace would be our due did we let his life slip out under our roof-tree for want of proper care. And hark'ee; get ready all the dressings thou hast, for wounded men enough will be here ere long, and let the boards be spread {{with the best of}} meat and ale, for we have gone through hard work to-day, and there is harder yet in store for us, I trow." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR ARCHER, - What am I to say? I {{have read}} your friend's book with {{singular}} relish. If {{he has written}} any other, I beg you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> it; and <b>if</b> he has not, I beg him to lose no time in supplying the deficiency. It is full of promise; but I should like to know his age. There are things in it that are very clever, to which I attach small importance; it is {{the shape of the}} age. And there are passages, particularly the rally in presence of the Zulu king, that show genuine and remarkable narrative talent - a talent that few will have the wit to understand, a talent of strength, spirit, capacity, sufficient vision, and sufficient self-sacrifice, which last is the chief point in a narrator.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are in bed, are you?" [...] said he. [...] "Well, that's {{good for}} you. Turn down that coverlid and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you've got your nightclothes on." [...] She obeyed. [...] "Very well," [...] he continued; [...] "now you stay there until I {{tell you to}} get up." ...|$|E
6000|$|No, he said; he had shuffled along. Half rising, he {{attempted}} to show her humourously how he walked nowadays--tried not to wince, but had to. Ugh, that was a twinge! Grizel sarcastically offered her assistance, and he took her shoulder gratefully. They crossed the room--a tedious journey. [...] "Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> you can manage alone," [...] she says, and suddenly deserts him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} be able to say the same, surely," [...] {{answered}} the Major, composing his face again, and rising carefully. [...] "I have to thank you, exceedingly, my dear sir, for your prompt generosity: but it is better discipline for a man, in many ways, to find things for himself than to have them put into his hands. So, with a thousand thanks, you shall <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can dredge a Turbinolia for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|June 7 [...] .--M. de la Feste has written--one {{letter to}} her, one to me. Hers {{could not have}} been very warm, for she did not {{brighten}} on reading it. Mine was an ordinary note of friendship, filling an ordinary sheet of paper, which I handed over to Caroline when I had finished looking it through. But there was a scrap of paper {{in the bottom of the}} envelope, which I dared not show any one. This scrap is his real letter: I scanned it alone in my room, trembling, hot and cold by turns. He tells me he is very wretched; that he deplores what has happened, but was helpless. Why did I <b>let</b> him <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> only to make him faithless. Alas, alas! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have still}} strangely to record moments when, {{in spite of}} the {{aspirations}} I had achieved, of the redeeming vision I had gained, at the thought of returning to her I revolted. At such times recollections came into my mind of those characteristics in her that had seemed most responsible for my alienation.... That demon I had fed so mightily still lived. By what right--he seemed to ask--had I nourished him all these years if now I meant to starve him? Thus sometimes he defied me, took on Protean guises, blustered, insinuated, cajoled, managed to make me believe that to starve him would be to starve myself, to sap all there was of power in <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> try and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I could do it! Again he whispered, to what purpose had I gained my liberty, if now I renounced it? I could not live in fetters, even though the fetters should be self-imposed. I was lonely now, but I would get over that, and life lay before me still.|$|R
6000|$|But {{after much}} time, his mother, hearing of his fame, {{came to see}} him, but was forbidden, because no woman entered that place. But when the blessed Simeon heard the voice of his mother, he said to her, [...] "Bear up, my mother, a little while, and we shall <b>see</b> each other, <b>if</b> God will." [...] But she, hearing this, began to weep, and tearing her hair, rebuked him, saying, [...] "Son, why hast thou done this? In return for the body in which I bore thee, thou hast filled me full of grief. For the milk with which I nourished thee, thou hast given me tears. For the kiss with which I kissed thee, thou hast given me bitter pangs of heart. For the grief and labour which I have suffered, thou hast laid on me cruel stripes." [...] And she spoke {{so much that she}} made us all weep. The blessed Simeon, hearing the voice of her who bore him, put {{his face in his hands}} and wept bitterly; and {{commanded}} her, saying, [...] "Lady mother, be still a little time, and we shall see each other in eternal rest." [...] But she began to say, [...] "By Christ, who formed thee, if there is a probability of seeing thee, who hast been so long a stranger to <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> thee; or <b>if</b> not, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> only hear thy voice and die at once; for thy father is dead in sorrow because of thee. And now do not destroy me for very bitterness, my son." [...] Saying this, for sorrow and weeping she fell asleep; for during three days and three nights she had not ceased entreating him. Then the blessed Simeon prayed the Lord for her, and she forthwith gave up the ghost.|$|R
