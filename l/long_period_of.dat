5|$|After a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{remaining}} empty, {{the castle}} {{slowly began to}} decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable.

However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
