Thus, restricting <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> firms and reducing the distance between firms improve consumer welfare, through lower prices and smaller transportation costs for consumers. We introduce strategic reward contracts into the location-price models. We find that in contrast to the above existing result, restriction <b>of</b> the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> firms reduces consumer welfare. Restricting <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> the firms reduces transportation costs but increases the prices through the change of strategic commitments by the firms, and it yields a counterintuitive result. ...|$|R

The <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> satellites that have high velocities relative to their hosts are statistically indistinguishable from the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> satellites that have low velocities relative to their hosts.
