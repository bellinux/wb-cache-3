5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain <b>large</b> <b>amounts</b> of fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats.

Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that <b>large</b> <b>amounts</b> of money were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in <b>large</b> <b>amounts</b> of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E

40|$|As a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> {{of blood}} loss is {{sometimes}} encountered in limb salvage procedures for pelvic tumours, {{it is essential}} to identify risk factors predicting the possibility of extensive haemorrhage. We retrospectively reviewed 137 patients who underwent pelvic tumour resections. Patients with an estimated blood loss greater than 3, 000  ml were classified as having a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> of blood loss. Sixty-one (44. 53 %) patients had blood loss greater than 3, 000  ml. Tumours involving the acetabulum or sacrum, tumour volume greater than 400  cm 3, aorta occlusion, resection method, reconstruction and operative time were all associated with a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> of blood loss. Pelvic tumours involving the acetabulum or sacrum (odds ratio: 4. 837), tumour volume greater than 400  cm 3 (odds ratio: 3. 005) and planned operation time of more than 200 min (odds ratio: 3. 784) independently predicted a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> of blood loss. Pelvic tumours with these characteristics were likely to have a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> of blood loss during surgery...|$|R
