Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus.

Several techniques for elucidating the identity, quantity and conformation of lysozyme deposited on soft contact lenses have been developed. Lysozyme also deposits on the newly introduced silicone hydrogel (SH) <b>lens</b> <b>materials,</b> but in extremely low levels compared to conventional hydrogel lenses. Hence, a major analytical complication with {{the study of the}} SH contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> relates to the minute quantity of deposited lysozyme. The first project of this thesis involved the development of a method whereby lysozyme mass extracted from SH <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> would be preserved over time and would be compatible with an optimized Western blotting procedure.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the decrease in}} end-of-day comfort for soft contact lens (CL) wearers and to investigate its association with <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and power, <b>lens</b> dehydration with wear and lens care product. Methods: Forty-five neophyte CL wearers were fitted with a daily disposable lens (nelfilcon-A or stenofilcon-A or nesofilcon-A) in one eye and a monthly disposable lens (lotrafilcon-B or comfilcon-A or balafilcon-A) in the other eye for three months. OPTIFREE-Puremoist solution was provided as lens care product {{for the first two}} months but for the third month, either OPTIFREE-Puremoist or AOSEPT was provided. Level of comfort was evaluated subjectively two times a day (after lens insertion and before removal), every day on a 100 division scale. The comparison was made between the first and third months, in the morning and at the end-of-day. Correlation of average comfort level and reduction in end-of-day comfort was determined with <b>lens</b> dehydration, <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and dioptric power. Effect of lens care products was also determined. Results: End-of-day comfort reduced significantly (p 0. 05), but was associated with <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> (p< 0. 05). Nelfilcon-A lens maintained the similar comfort level throughout the day. Reduction in end-of-day comfort was not correlated with lens dehydration after wear (p= 0. 102), but it was less with peroxide care system than with polyquad based solution (p= 0. 034). Conclusion: End-of-day comfort decreases on soft CL wearers, which is associated with <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and care products. Peroxide system induces less reduction in end-of-day comfort. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of contact}} lenses {{has become an}} area of intense research, {{with the belief that}} the more "hydrophilic" or wettable the lens surface is, the more comfortable the lens may be, as the posterior surface of the eyelid will move more smoothly over it, hence increasing comfort. There are many ways to assess the wettability of a given material, namely sessile drop, 1 captive bubble 2 or Wilhelmy plate. 3 This thesis used the sessile drop method to determine the surface wettability of various hydrogel contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials,</b> by measuring the advancing contact angle made between the lens surface and a pre-determined volume of HPLC-grade water. This was followed by measuring the surface wettability following periods in which the <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> were soaked in various contact lens care regimens. Further studies determined wettability of <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> after various periods of in-eye wear and finally a study was undertaken to evaluate if a novel biological technique could be used to differentiate proteins that deposit on hydrogel <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> that may affect wettability and cause discomfort. 	A variety of hydrogel lenses, taken directly from their packaging and after soaking in various care regimens, were analyzed to determine their sessile drop advancing contact angles, in vitro. These studies indicated that poly- 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA) -based lenses are inherently more wettable than silicone-based lenses, unless they have a surface treatment that completely covers the hydrophobic siloxane groups. Additionally, certain combinations of <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and care regimens produce inherently more wettable surfaces when measured in vitro. 	Suitable methods to assess contact lens wettability ex vivo, or after subjects had worn lenses for set periods of time, were developed. It was determined that using latex gloves to remove lenses had no impact upon the lens surface wettability and that rinsing of the lens surface after removal from the eye was required to determine the wettability of the underlying polymer. 	The final wettability studies involved an analysis of various <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> from clinical studies conducted within the Centre for Contact Lens Research (CCLR). These studies investigated differences in wettability between silicone hydrogel lenses manufactured from differing polymers and variations in ex vivo wettability of several combinations of <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and solutions, worn for varying periods of time. 	A novel method to investigate proteins extracted from lenses using 2 D-Difference in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) found that this technique could be used to analyze proteins extracted from contact lenses. The data obtained showed that {{there was no difference between}} a group of subjects who were symptomatic of lens-induced dryness or a control group, and that care solutions had a minimal influence on the pattern of deposition seen. 	The overall conclusion of these studies is that hydrogel lens wettability is affected by the polymer composition and that care regimen components can modify the surface wettability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{variables}} that influence lipid deposition on conventional and silicone hydrogel contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and to build a physiologically relevant in vitro model of lipid deposition on contact lenses. Methods: Lipid deposition on contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> can lead to discomfort and vision difficulty for lens wearers. Using a variety of radiochemical experiments and two model lipids (cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine), a number of clinically significant parameters that may influence lipid deposition were examined. •	The optimization and characterization of a novel artificial tear solution (ATS) was examined (Chapter 3) •	Optimization of an extraction system to remove deposited cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine from various contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> (Chapter 4) •	The influence of different tear film components on lipid deposition was researched (Chapter 5) •	The efficiency of hydrogen peroxide disinfecting solutions to remove deposited lipid from contact lenses was investigated (Chapter 6) •	The effect of intermittent air exposure on lipid deposition was examined {{through the use of}} a custom built “model blink cell” (Chapter 7) Results: A novel complex ATS designed for in-vial incubations of contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> was developed. This solution was stable and did not adversely affect the physical parameters of the contact lenses incubated within it. An efficient extraction protocol for deposited cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine was optimized based on chloroform and methanol with the addition of water and acetic acid for phosphatidylcholine extraction. Overall, cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine deposition is cumulative over time and found to deposit in greater masses on silicone-containing hydrogels. Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine deposition is influenced by the composition of the incubation medium and air exposure which occurs during the inter-blink period. Hydrogen peroxide disinfecting solutions were able to remove only marginal amounts of lipid from the contact lenses, with the surfactant containing solution removing more. Conclusion: This thesis has provided hitherto unavailable information on the way in which lipid interacts with conventional and silicone hydrogel contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> and the in vitro model built here can be utilized in various ways in the future to assess other aspects and variables of lipid and protein deposition on a variety of biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|The soft {{contact lenses}} of today {{are made from}} a variety of {{hydrogel}} materials. These materials have different properties in terms of water content, monomers, hardness and other tensile characteristics. It is likely that the frictional properties also vary between materials. It is known that constituents of the tear film interact with contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> to form a biofilm on the lens surface. The hypothesis of this research is that although the frictional properties of <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> may vary these properties do not affect the comfort and performance of the lenses in vivo. A tribometer is a device to measure the coefficient of friction of materials. There was no commercially available tribometer designed specifically for use with contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials,</b> so one was constructed and validated against standard solid materials. The same equipment was used to determine the friction coefficients of five contemporary soft <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> under different conditions of lubrication but, unlike other tribometers, this unique design simulated human blinking as far as possible. The experimental friction coefficients varied widely from 0. 27 to 5. 89 under different conditions of lubrication. The largest variation between materials was seen using the most viscous lubricant. For the in vivo studies the author coordinated the manufacture of 250 contact lenses, which were lathe cut and polished to a standard design, achieving exceptionally tight tolerances, using the same five materials. This rigourous process was carried out to minimise variations in the geometry of each contact lens. Subjects were screened to minimise ocular heterogeneities between subjects. Clinical performance of each lens was assessed using comfort, contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, entoptic phenomena, non-invasive tear break-up time and lens movement on the eye. In a clinical environment none of these parameters showed any associations with the coefficients of friction found in vitro, apart from a moderate correlation (rho = 0. 5) between lens movement and the coefficient of friction under borderline friction conditions. In conclusion, the findings of this research support the hypothesis that frictional properties of soft lenses do not affect comfort and performance in vivo...|$|R

[URL] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} ciprofloxacin-releasing silicone hydrogel contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of microbial keratitis. Methods. : Model silicone hydrogel contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials</b> were manufactured using a molecular imprinting technique to modify ciprofloxacin release kinetics. Various contact lens properties, including light transmission and surface wettability, were determined, and the in vitro ciprofloxacin release kinetics elucidated using fluorescence spectrophotometry.

Results. : Synthesized <b>lenses</b> had similar <b>material</b> properties to commercial contact <b>lens</b> <b>materials.</b> There was a decrease in light transmission in the shorter wavelengths due to incorporation of the antibiotic, but over 80 % light transmission between 400 and 700 nm.
