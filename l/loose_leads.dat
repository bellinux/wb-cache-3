2500|$|In piano technology, swaging {{happens in}} several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's {{earliest}} history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled {{into the side}} of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, due to fluctuations in humidity and as the wood ages in piano key-sticks and underlevers, space develops around leads causing them to rattle, tick, or knock. <b>Loose</b> <b>leads</b> in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a [...] "tick" [...] sound) is coming from. The remedy for the noise is swaging—squashing the leads with a short steel rod. Swaging the lead fills the void and eliminates the noise.|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract One {{of the major}} problems in pattern mining is {{the explosion of the}} number of results. Tight constraints reveal only common knowledge, while <b>loose</b> constraints <b>lead</b> to an explosion in the number of returned patterns. This is caused by large groups of patterns essentially describing the same set of transactions. In this paper we approach this problem using the MDL principle: the best set of patterns is that set that compresses the database best. For this task we introduce the Krimp algorithm. Experimental evaluation shows that typically only hundreds of itemsets are returned; a dramatic reduction, up to seven orders of magnitude, in the number of frequent item sets. These selections, called code tables, are of high quality. This is shown with compression ratios, swap-randomisation, and the accuracies of the code table-base...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of bubbles {{has long been}} vigorously debated in the academia. Recent efforts have concentrated {{on the development of}} models for detecting bubbles, a topic which has yet to reach a consensus among researchers. To provide a more reliable and accurate approach to measure bubbles, we establish a novel method to disentangle the bubble phenomena in securitized property markets: two new specific indicators are introduced to measure (i) the magnitude of bubbles (CM) and (ii) the riskiness of a bubbled market (β). The findings suggest that converging co-integrations between Asian markets are always accompanied by the formation of bubbles. As <b>loose</b> credit <b>leads</b> to a booming market, bubbles appear with a rebounding risk-free rate, and lifts up the β. Changes in credit could be considered a significant indicator of bubbles booming. In this respect, this study provides important implications for both investors and governments.

40|$|Injury due to burning {{is known}} to impact on {{coagulation}} and haemostasis by disturbing the coagulation cascade and is also associated with impaired fibrinolysis. Also, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and hypercoagulability are common during thermal injury. Using a Wistar albino rat model, we investigated in this study whether burn injury affects the ultrastructure of the fibrin networks. A typical fibrin network will contain mostly major, thick fibres with minor, thin fibres distributed amongst them. We found that the clot architecture changes after burn injury, showing more prominent minor, thin fibres in a netted appearance. Also, the clot showed areas of matted fibrin. We suggest that the thrombotic events associated with burn injury are due to the thickened and netlike areas formed when thrombin activates the coagulation cascade. This is due to impaired fibrinolysis activities, causing the resulting fibrin clots not to be successfully disseminated. Small fragments of these netted, clumped areas may therefore break <b>loose</b> and <b>lead</b> to thrombotic events after burn injuries. The current study therefore provided morphological evidence for thrombotic events associated with burn injury. How to cite this article: Pretorius, E., Olivier, J., Oberholzer, H.

40|$|Does {{monetary}} policy {{act as a}} constraint on the quantity of bank credit? Does it affect banks’ risk-taking? Do markets monitor banks’ risk-taking behavior? These questions have important implications on {{our understanding of the}} consequences of {{monetary policy}} and—in light of recent financial crises—on the design of macro-prudential regulation. I address these question in the context of thrifts [...] U. S. banks that specialize in mortgage lending [...] in the years preceding the Sub-prime Crisis. Exploiting loan-level data on banks’ lending, I find that the effects of monetary policy do not conform to traditional theories of the bank lending channel: the quantity of small banks’ lending is not especially sensitive to monetary policy [...] it is larger banks that are considerably more responsive. I also examine the cross-sectional effects of monetary policy on banks’ risk-taking. Using a novel contemporaneous measure of banks’ risk-taking that I construct from loan approval data, I find that less-capitalized banks’ increase risk-taking more in response to loose policy. This finding suggests that <b>loose</b> policy <b>leads</b> to excessive risk-taking in the presence of agency problems between bank owners and bank liability holders. Finally, I find mixed evidence on the role of market monitoring.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of trans -stilbene (t -St) on the acidic aluminum-, gallium-, and boron-containing zeolite beta (H-AlBEA, H-GaBEA, and H-BBEA, respectively) is investigated using UV/vis and time-resolved UV/vis spectroscopy, {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. On H-AlBEA, {{the results}} show a fast and spontaneous one-electron oxidation of t -St, quickly followed by the recapture of an electron from the zeolite framework by the t -St *+ radical cation {{and the formation of}} a long-lived charge-transfer complex (t -St H-AlBEA *-*+). This charge-transfer complex (I) evolves over a period of months into a spectroscopically distinct charge-transfer complex (II). Evidence for the (undetected) intermediate t -St *+ radical cation is obtained using time-resolved UV/vis spectroscopy. Similar electron-transfer processes have been observed in the acidic ferrierite, ZSM- 5, and mordenite aluminosilicate zeolites. The key difference is that the rate of electron recapture by the t -St *+ radical cation is much faster than that in all of the other zeolites. This is in agreement with the trend observed in the ferrierite, ZSM- 5, and mordenite zeolites: <b>looser</b> fit <b>leads</b> to a lower stability of the radical cation intermediate and leads to a rapid hole transfer to the zeolite framework to form a charge-transfer complex.
