Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [...] so they were both <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the full actor-power of all the emotions {{they were supposed to be}} feeling at their own wedding, just blasting in my face.

500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{pointed out}} that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing. Gordon took pole dancing lessons {{for a period of}} a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the {{experience}} embarrassing and physically challenging. She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> – it's like having your mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|Robey {{was engaged}} to play the title role in the 1905 {{pantomime}} Queen of Hearts. The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing [...] "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, [...] "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day." [...] Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as [...] "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated [...] "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over {{the next few years}} he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, [...] "What Are You <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>Me</b> For?" [...] and [...] "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] is {{a country}} song written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby and Lindsay Dawn Chapman, and {{produced}} by Dann Huff. It features American country singer-songwriter Vince Gill. The song {{is set in a}} [...] "drowsy, take-it-easy beat" [...] which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies. The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings [...] "I see the way you’re <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> / Baby know I’m feeling it too / We can just light up every candle / Move from room to room" [...] which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar. As the song launches into the chorus, both Clarkson and Gill are heard singing [...] "Stopping every minute just because you're in it/Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me/It's how it's supposed to be", a vocal chorus deemed as [...] "slightly awkward" [...] by Will Hermes of Rolling Stone. In the final chorus, the pair pauses before the key changes at minute three.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

In cross-examination, he noted he remembered this only when it later became relevant. M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he heard people joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it [...] "seemed like the jokes were at somebody else's expense". When he left the room, there were about five students who [...] "seemed to be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and it seemed kind of unsettling".|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E

2500|$|Kerouac was {{demoralized}} by {{criticism of}} Dharma Bums from such respected {{figures in the}} American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. [...] He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D. T. Suzuki, that [...] "even Suzuki was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter." [...] He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen, [...] "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. [...] I'm not a Buddhist any more." [...] In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's cafe recitation, Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul: [...] "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." [...] Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

[...] Just seven days after taking the throne, Emperor Xuānzong, to the surprise of the entire imperial administration, sent Li Deyu out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit, and also exiled Li Deyu's associates Xue Yuanshang (薛元賞) and Xue Yuanxhang's brother Xue Yuangui (薛元龜). Soon after, Emperor Xuānzong issued an edict permitting the five former Niu Faction chancellors exiled by Emperor Wuzong—Niu Sengru, Li Zongmin, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue—to be promoted to positions closer to Chang'an, although Li Zongmin died before he could be moved. Emperor Xuānzong also made Li Deyu the defender of Luoyang and removed the honorary chancellor title that he continued to carry as the military governor of Jingnan from him, further showing disapproval.|$|E
