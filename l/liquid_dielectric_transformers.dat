50|$|When the {{distance}} between the two electrodes is reduced, the intensity of the electric field in the space between the electrodes becomes greater than the strength of the dielectric (at the nearest point(s)), which electrically break down, allowing current to flow between the two electrodes. This phenomenon {{is the same as the}} breakdown of a capacitor. As a result, material is removed from both the electrodes. Once the current flow stops (or it is stopped - depending on the type of generator), new <b>liquid</b> <b>dielectric</b> is usually conveyed into the inter-electrode volume, enabling the solid particles (debris) to be carried away and the insulating properties of the dielectric to be restored. Adding new <b>liquid</b> <b>dielectric</b> in the inter-electrode volume is commonly referred to as flushing. Also, after a current flow, a difference of potential between the two electrodes is restored to what it was before the breakdown, so that a new <b>liquid</b> <b>dielectric</b> breakdown can occur.|$|R

Nano-EM is capable of machining nano-features, under both, <b>liquid</b> <b>dielectric</b> (wet nano-EM) and air dielectric (dry nano-EM) media. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a comparative study between the wet and dry nano-EM processes based on process mechanism, machining performance, consistency and dimensional repeatability of these two processes. The comparison of the two processes has been conducted at near field nano-EM, where the gap between the tool electrode and workpiece is 2 nm and the machining is performed at room temperature and pressure (macroscopically). The major differences in the process mechanism are due to the media at dielectric interface, the breakdown field strength and breakdown characteristics of two dielectrics and therefore, the material removal mechanism. It is reported that the material removal mechanism of wet nano-EM is associated with field emission-assisted avalanche in nano-confined <b>liquid</b> <b>dielectric,</b> whereas, the material removal mechanism in dry nano-EM is associated with field-induced evaporation of material. The differences have also been observed in the machining performance, dimensions of the machined features and repeatability of the nanoscale machined features.

Experimental characterization of material removal in dry electrical discharge drilling technique is presented in this paper. It is based on six-factor, three-level experiment using L(27) orthogonal array. All the experiments were performed in a 'quasi-explosion' mode by controlling pulse 'off-time' so as to maximize the material removal rate (MRR). Furthermore, an enclosure was provided around the electrodes with the aim to create a back pressure thereby restricting expansion of the plasma in the dry EDM process. The main response variables analyzed in this work were MRR, tool wear rate (TWR), oversize and compositional variation across the machined cross-sections. Statistical analysis of the results show that discharge current (I), gap voltage (V) and rotational speed (N) significantly influence MRR. TWR was found close to zero in most of the experiments. A predominant deposition of melted and eroded work material on the electrode surface instead of tool wear was evident.
