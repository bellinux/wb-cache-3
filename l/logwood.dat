5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and <b>logwood</b> dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

25|$|<b>Logwood</b> {{tree trunks}} were floated down the Black River {{to the port}} to be shipped to England for making of dyes.|$|E
25|$|In January 1805 Nimrod recaptured the American ship Ardent, {{which had}} been {{carrying}} coffee and <b>logwood</b> when a French privateer had captured her.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} between 28 February and 20 May 1800, Nimrod {{captured}} the Spanish felucca Victoria, which was sailing from Tobasco to Jamaica with a cargo of specie, <b>logwood,</b> and cochineal. It {{is not clear}} who her commander was {{while she was in}} the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|English and Scottish {{settlers}} and pirates {{known as the}} Baymen entered the area from the 17th century, with Baymen first settling {{on the coast of}} what is now Belize in 1638, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships (see English settlement in Belize). The settlers established a trade colony and port in what became the Belize District,. and during the 18th century, established a system using black slaves to cut the <b>logwood</b> (Haematoxylum campechianum) tree. This yielded a valuable fixing agent for clothing dyes, {{and was one of the}} first ways to achieve a fast black before the advent of artificial dyes. The Spanish granted the British settlers the right to occupy the area and cut <b>logwood</b> in exchange for helping to suppress piracy.|$|E
25|$|Every was {{probably}} a sailor from youth, serving on various Royal Navy ships. Popular accounts state that Every served aboard the English fleet bombarding Algiers in 1671, buccaneered in the Caribbean Sea, and even captained a <b>logwood</b> freighter in the Bay of Campeche, although these stories come from Adrian van Broeck's fictional memoir. The substantiated record picks up in March 1689, shortly after the breakout of the Nine Years' War.|$|E
25|$|Diligence {{cleared the}} Bahama Straits on 3 March {{and the next}} day she was ten leagues SW of the Pan of Motonzas when she {{encountered}} and captured Nativetas (or Natividad) after an action that lasted three-quarters of an hour. Nativetas was about 500 tons (bm), was armed with 16 guns, and carried a crew of 50 men. She was carrying a cargo of <b>logwood</b> and had that day left Havana for Cadiz.|$|E
25|$|During {{his term}} as viceroy, Zúñiga y Guzmán {{was able to}} expel the English from Laguna de Términos (in present-day Campeche). This site had been {{occupied}} almost continuously since 1663 by pirates and by Englishmen directing the illegal cutting of precious woods. (The Spanish did not make this distinction.) In 1714 alone, the English sent 150 ships carrying <b>logwood</b> from the site. Also in that year the English had 1,000 men, 16 fortifications, six large warships, four brigantines and six sloops {{on the island of}} Tris in the Laguna de Términos.|$|E
25|$|In April 1779 France and Spain {{signed the}} Convention of Aranjuez, which {{laid out a}} summary of Bourbon war aims. Spain sought to recover Gibraltar and Menorca, Mobile and Pensacola in Florida, and to expel the British from Spanish Central America by ending their right to cut <b>logwood</b> in the Bay of Honduras and the coast of Campeche. France {{declared}} that her aims were to expel the British from the Newfoundland fishery, to end restrictions on French sovereignty over Dunkirk, to regain free trade in India, to recover Senegal and Dominica, and to restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions relating to the Anglo-French commerce.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, {{patterns}} shifted in Yucatán and Tabasco, as the English took territory the Spanish claimed {{but did not}} control, especially what became British Honduras (now Belize), where they cut dyewood and in Laguna de Términos (Isla del Carmen) where they cut <b>logwood.</b> In 1716–17 viceroy of New Spain organized a sufficient ships to expel the foreigners, where the crown subsequently built a fortress at Isla del Carmen. But the British held onto their territory in the eastern portion of the peninsula into the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the enclave supplied guns to the rebellious Maya in the Caste War of Yucatan.|$|E
25|$|The English {{were again}} {{exploiting}} the precious woods of the region, in Yucatan and Belize. A Spanish privateer seized an English sloop and frigate carrying <b>logwood</b> off Cape Catoche, Yucatan (now in Quintana Roo). Acuña y Manrique sent an armed expedition {{consisting of two}} pirogues of war, one galleon and 300 men to dislodge the English. However, upon arrival the Spanish discovered that the English were numerous and well armed, with 800 men and large warships. The Spanish expedition was not successful. Parallel diplomatic negotiations also came to nothing. The viceroy let the matter drop, preferring to concentrate on things over which he had control. These included the garrisons at San Juan de Ulúa, Isla del Carmen, Veracruz, and the bays of Espíritu Santo and Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|Seeing a {{decrease}} in their exports to Spanish America caused by {{the growing popularity of}} aguardiente de cana, a brandy made locally from sugar cane, the large Spanish purveyors of spirits complained to the crown, and sought royal protection for their interests. In 1748, a royal cedula (decree) was issued instructing provincial governors to prohibit the production and consumption of aguardiente. The same year Benavides came into conflict with the council of Campeche over his use of Indian labor to work in rice paddies, and for the cutting of <b>logwood</b> trees (from the heartwood of which a valuable fabric dye was extracted) and other timber trees. Antonio Benavides' term in Yucatan ended in 1750 when he was appointed governor of Manila in the Philippines in September of that year.|$|E
25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the Bright Leaf tobacco variety (a lighter flavored tobacco leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual <b>logwood.</b> This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated the curing process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from the charcoal was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed the curing process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, lighter tobacco which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco. This trend had not yet hit America for its export market.|$|E
25|$|James I {{attempted}} to establish silk production in England, purchasing and planting 100,000 mulberry trees, some on land adjacent to Hampton Court Palace, {{but they were}} of a species unsuited to the silk worms, and the attempt failed. In 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at <b>Logwood</b> mill in Stockport; in 1744, Burton Mill was erected in Macclesfield; and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton. These three towns remained {{the centre of the}} English silk throwing industry until silk throwing was replaced by silk waste spinning. British enterprise also established silk filature in Cyprus in 1928. In England in the mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at Lullingstone Castle in Kent. Silkworms were raised and reeled under the direction of Zoe Lady Hart Dyke, later moving to Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire in 1956.|$|E
25|$|Christened Whydah {{after the}} West African slave trading kingdom of Ouidah (pronounced WIH-dah), the vessel was {{configured}} as a heavily armed trading and transport ship (which included the Atlantic slave trade). It {{set out for}} its maiden voyage in early 1716, carrying a variety of goods from different businesses to exchange for delivery, trade, and slaves in West Africa. After traveling down West Africa through modern-day Gambia and Senegal to Nigeria and Benin, where its namesake port was located, it left Africa with an estimated 500 slaves, gold, including Akan jewelry, and ivory aboard. It traveled to the Caribbean, where it traded and sold the cargo and slaves for precious metals, sugar, indigo, rum, <b>logwood,</b> pimento, ginger, and medicinal ingredients, which were to then be transported back to England. Fitted with a standard complement of 18 six-pound cannon, which could be increased {{to a total of}} 28 in time of war.|$|E
25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: <b>Logwood</b> Haematoxylon campechianum; a large spiny tree that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. Brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another spiny tree native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the True indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|E
25|$|Piracy saw a brief {{resurgence}} {{between the}} end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain's Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain's breakup of the English <b>logwood</b> settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy, political discontent, concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments, and an increased determination by parliament to suppress piracy, resulted in the Piracy Act of 1717 and of 1721. These established a seven-year penal transportation to North America as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies, or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon.|$|E
500|$|Producing fast {{black in}} the Middle Ages was a {{complicated}} process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but {{at the dawn of}} Early Modern period, a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World. [...] The new method used <b>logwood</b> (Haematoxylum campechianum), a dyewood native to Mexico and Central America. Although <b>logwood</b> was poorly received at first, producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo, it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a ferrous sulfate (copperas) mordant. [...] Despite changing fashions in color, <b>logwood</b> was the most widely used dye by the 19th century, providing the sober blacks of formal and mourning clothes.|$|E
500|$|The Admiralty then renamed her Retribution on 31 January 1800. [...] She was recommissioned in September 1800 at Jamaica under Captain Samuel Forster. Apparently {{before that}} she {{detained}} an American schooner sailing from Port Republic with a cargo {{of coffee and}} <b>logwood.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 14 September 1796 she {{captured}} the Lesou. Lowestoffe was {{also among the}} vessels that in late 1799 {{captured the}} Spanish Letter of Marque Navarra (alias Diligent). Diligent was of 150 tons and was armed with eight guns. She was sailing from Bilboa to Veracruz with a cargo of wine, iron and writing paper. Lowestoffe also shared in the capture of the Spanish [...] "zartan" [...] Ambrosia, which was sailing from Cadiz for Veracruz with a cargo of 26.5 tons of quicksilver and 10 tons of writing paper. Lowestoffe alone captured the Spanish brig San Francisco, of 90 tons, sailing from Campeachy to Havana with a cargo of sugar and <b>logwood.</b>|$|E
500|$|Throughout history, {{people have}} dyed their {{textiles}} using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors {{such as the}} natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson kermes, became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as woad (Isatis tinctoria), indigo, saffron, and madder were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. [...] Dyes such as cochineal and <b>logwood</b> (Haematoxylum campechianum) were brought to Europe by the Spanish treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.|$|E
500|$|In March 1718, {{while taking}} on water at Turneffe Island east of Belize, both ships spotted the Jamaican <b>logwood</b> cutting sloop Adventure making for the harbour. [...] She was stopped and her captain, Harriot, {{invited to join}} the pirates. [...] Harriot and his crew {{accepted}} the invitation, and Teach sent over a crew to sail Adventure making Israel Hands the captain. They sailed for the Bay of Honduras, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla. [...] On 9April Teach's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt Protestant Caesar. [...] His fleet then sailed to Grand Cayman where they captured a [...] "small turtler". [...] Teach probably sailed toward Havana, where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port. [...] They then sailed to the wrecks of the 1715 Spanish fleet, off the eastern coast of Florida. [...] There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.|$|E
2500|$|Belize's economy {{depended}} on forestry {{until well into}} the 20th century. <b>Logwood,</b> used to make dye, was Belize's initial main export. [...] However, the supply outstripped the demand, especially as Europeans developed man-made dyes which were less expensive. [...] Loggers turned to mahogany, which grew in abundance in the country's forests. [...] The wood was prized for use in cabinets, ships, and railroad carriers.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the middle}} of 1800, Acasta was in company with [...] when they {{captured}} a Spanish brig laden with Tortula (Tortola) sugar, <b>logwood,</b> cotton, cochineal, etc. Acasta was in company with , , and Aquilon when they took the Spanish schooner San Pablos del Mundo and her cargo of jerk beef. Lastly, Acasta and Queen took the Spanish schooner General Massaredo, which had been sailing from Havana to Campeche with dry goods.|$|E
2500|$|Loyalists {{fleeing the}} United States {{during and after}} the American Revolution settled on various Bahama Islands {{including}} Andros, bringing their slaves with them. In addition, Andros was the destination of many families who were squeezed out of the Belize <b>logwood</b> industry following the relocation of Mosquito Coast settlers to British Honduras in 1787. By 1788 the population of all the Bahamas was reported as 3,000 whites and 8,000 blacks. The 1788 census for Andros reported 22 white heads of families, with a total of 132 slaves; they cultivated [...] of land.|$|E
2500|$|However, the end {{of slavery}} did little to change the former slaves' working {{conditions}} if they stayed at their trade. A series of institutions {{were put in place}} to restrict the ability of individuals to obtain land, in a debt-peonage system to organize the newly freed. The position of being [...] "extra special" [...] mahogany and <b>logwood</b> cutters undergirded the early ascriptions of the capacities (and consequently the limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, former slaves {{had little choice but to}} continue to work in timber cutting.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish {{enslavement}} of Africans to the New Spain {{had been}} {{authorized by the}} Catholic Monarchs in 1501. As part of ending the War of the Spanish Succession 1713, the Spanish Crown granted the Asiento slaving contract for 30 years to the British South Sea Company, a monopoly in the slave trade of African slaves to the Americas. Besides continuing slavery, the contract had the unintended effect of allowing the English to trade large quantities of unauthorized goods and merchandise directly with the Spanish colonies as well. [...] The longstanding British settlement at Laguna de Términos was another issue, which continued the illegal harvest of tropical woods, especially the <b>Logwood</b> trees, by the English.|$|E

She {{captured the}} Spanish vessel Diana, which was carrying <b>logwood,</b> the Spanish sloop Ovier, laden with dry goods, the French schooner Eagle, which was carrying coffee, and the Spanish schooner Consualidad, which was carrying mules from Porto Cavallo. Diligences boats cut the Dutch brig Minerva and her cargo of mahogany {{out of the}} Higuay (Higüey) River, and the Spanish brig Del Carpner and her cargo of mahogany. Diligence also captured the French schooner Rosario, which was carrying coffee from Jeremie to Curacoa, and the Danish sloop Aurora sailing from St Croix to Aux Cayes.
