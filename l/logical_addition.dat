Enzo Ruidera, Tuts Calinawan and Pow Rosal were schoolmates and decided to form a band. Eventually things got serious and they were winning battle of bands. The kids thought this might lead somewhere and eventually got Tayao, cousin of Pow Rosal to do vocal duties at the time both parties were starting to write original songs. So {{by the time they}} were ready to play they were already playing original songs in a time were playing covers. Landing regular gigs at hot spots back then like Club Dredd and Yosh Café, they steadily got noticed and slowly earned a following. CJ Olaguera who was constantly with the band eventually learned to play percussions and was a <b>logical</b> <b>addition</b> to the band because he was already always there anyway and he added new texture to the sound of the band. By the time, they were regulars at a number of bars and clubs. 8 Toleran, a neighbor and former guitarist of the band Piranha asked Ian if he could audition and join the band. As fate would have it, the band was actually looking for another guitar player. He fit in perfectly and he was in like that. RT de Ano, is another friend of the band and a DJ. He was another logical choice to be absorbed into the band because he was always there anyways and the idea of having a DJ in the band was shared by all of the members. By 1997, the band release and sold a two-song demo, the songs “Fine” and “The Way” were in it. Five thousand copies was sold out in a week. “Fine” eventually garnered airplay on NU107 and eventually hit the charts. The band was signed by Warner Music Philippines. In 1998, the self-titled debut album Cheese was released. Critics and fans alike received it beautifully. The singles “10x Karma” and “Fine” climbed the charts and the band was nominated on a number of categories at the ’99 NU107 Rock Awards. Maly Andres, the producer of the album won Producer of the Year award for his work on that album. The album went on to win an Awit Award for Rom Villaseran’s work on the album cover layout. The band went on to a successful tour of the album, even going to Korea to represent the Philippines in the 2000 Pusan Rock Festival. After touring and playing provinces, special events, clubs and bars. The band went on to write new materials. Biboy Garcia who went on to record with the band on their sophomore effort replaced RT de Ano. 2001 saw the release of Cheese’s second effort entitled Pilipinas. The album was critically acclaimed, named “the richest rock release of that year”. The album went on to win Vocalist of the Year, People’s Choice Award and Album of the Year in the 2001 NU107 Rock awards. The band went on to tour the new album, successfully. 2003, Queso officially announced that they were changing their name to Queso from Cheese because that is what the kids were calling them and it was only logical. That same year drummer Pow Rosal was replaced by drummer Robert dela Cruz. Robert came in to continue touring the album all throughout the country. In 2004, the band goes back to the studio to write new materials. 2005, Queso releases Buhay Queso, a DVD documentary about the band, members and their adventures. A year after, 2006, the band finishes recording and releases their latest self-titled effort Queso.|$|E

The rules comprise heuristic and fuzzy knowledge together with numerical data obtained from a geometric analysis of the control problem that considers the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the robot. Numerical data allow tuning the fuzzy symbols used in the rules to optimize the controller performance. From the implementation point of view, very few computational and memory resources are required: standard <b>logical,</b> <b>addition,</b> and multiplication operations and a few data that can be represented by integer values. This is illustrated with the design of a controller for the safe navigation of an autonomous car-like robot among possible obstacles toward a goal configuration.

40|$|Novel {{trends in}} {{application}} of laser-welded steel sandwich panels in load carrying structures demand the conceptual development of optimum design guidelines. These sandwich panels, {{made by a}} process of laser welding faceplates to core-stiffeners, express advanced cost/weight ratio properties compared with the panel load carrying capacity versus the own weight. A particular problem in application of lightweight sandwich panels is ability of fast structural assembly by welded or mechanical joining techniques. For effective implementation of these sandwich structures for optimum design, new type of design methods should be introduced. For this reason, the optimization technique of building metamodels has been developed employing the response surface methodology (RSM) and design of experiments (DoE). Additionally for designer convince, metamodels used for design optimization can be implemented for parametrical studies and sensitivity analysis. The resulting design procedure provides an effective optimal design tool that permits optimizing of different core type sandwich panels with respect to jointing capabilities. In particular case different core-stiffened type sandwich panels under bending loading are considered. The choice of design variables depends on the core type of steel sandwich panel and industrial demands. Therefore design variables should suit all scope core type panel designs. For the optimum design the following parameters are taken: the panel length and width, the sandwich stiffener height and spacing factor, {{the top and bottom}} as well as core plate thicknesses. Validation with physical experiments within the design space is performed and good agreement achieved.

If the discipline that actually handles Human Knowledge is KM, Knowledge Management, our aim is to create the basement of an enhanced management system that handles (K + K’) instead, where K corresponds to the actual formal established knowledge and K ’ corresponds to the up to now “informal ” People’s knowledge. We discuss in this document some conjectures to build a body doctrine that enables us to define symmetries in both cognitive domains, namely the Establishment Domain and the People’s Domain, {{in order to facilitate}} the building of an enhanced and evolutionary Human intelligence. As a first step an intelligence skeleton is proposed for the K side that enables us to see order in the huge reservoirs of Human Knowledge documents, as the triad: Logical Tree of the Human Knowledge, Thematic Thesaurus of the Human Knowledge, and documents.

Under this new paradigm the progressive creation of the K ’ triad is feasible, providing us a new way to enhance knowledge management. Examples of this enhancement will be: the building up of high resolution search engines with the capability to locate precisely almost everything hosted in the Establishment Domain in a few queries; to know as much as possible the people’s behavior patterns, what they need and what they want; {{and at the same time}} to know as much as possible about the K ’ intelligence as a whole entity. Both sides interacting harmoniously could strive towards a human welfare optimum utopi...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The basic {{question}} for radiation oncologists {{is what we}} hope to achieve from treatments that are adjuvant to surgery: better local (pelvic) control and, hopefully, because of that, fewer metastases. Chemotherapy could add to the local effect of irradiation and may also decrease distant metastases directly. Selection criteria for individual treatment could enhance the therapeutic index. LOCAL CONTROL: Total mesorectal excision reduces the incidence of local recurrence, but preoperative (chemo) radiation is still indicated for more advanced tumors (T 3 -T 4) and for lymph node involvement. Pelvic recurrences arise from tumor clonogens residual beyond the surgical margins. Thus, the practice of shrinking fields to boost the dose to the primary tumor makes no sense, except for tumors that invade residual structures, such as the sacrum. Subclinical disease beyond the future surgical margins grows more quickly than the primary tumor, and hence treatment should be as intense as tolerable. A short treatment course (e. g. 5 x 5 Gy) is desirable, but this regimen, which is currently the gold standard, should be compared (as in the recently closed randomized Polish trial) with higher-dose, longer-duration chemoradiotherapy regimens. The recently closed EORTC trial 22921 examines the benefit of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy combined with a long schedule of radiation. Likewise, continuous infusion of a cycle-active agent rather than bolus administration is a <b>logical</b> <b>addition</b> to radiation therapy {{in the treatment of}} fast-growing subclinical tumor extensions. SYSTEMIC DISEASE: The reduction in distant metastasis rates attributable to adjuvant chemotherapy varies greatly among reports. If the reduction is of the order of 10 - 25 %, the efficacy of chemotherapy equates to as little as about 5 to 12. 5 Gy and not more than 20 Gy of total body irradiation. INTERVAL BETWEEN RADIATION THERAPY AND POSTRADIATION SURGERY: Early excision after preoperative irradiation would be desirable if the primary tumor were still disseminating viable metastatic clonogens. Most tumors do not metastasize until they contain enough viable clonogens to render them clinically detectable. A dose of 10 Gy in 2 Gy fractions reduces at least 30 -fold the absolute number of viable clonogens in the primary tumor, to levels that do not yield metastases from the untreated tumor. After a dose of 44 - 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, there is little chance that the surviving tumor clonogens could regrow to a metastasis-yielding volume in any reasonable radiation-surgery interval. Thus there is no tumor-related necessity for early postradiation surgery. The importance of the interval between radiation and surgery is currently being addressed in a Swedish randomized trial. PROGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE CHARACTERIZATION: Tumor volume {{should be included in the}} staging system. There are many tumor- and host-related characteristics that can be used to fingerprint the tumor to help select appropriate individual treatment. status: publishe...|$|E

His accomplishments include (1) developing the first comprehensive theory of semantics within generative grammar, (2) proposing that language is an abstract rather than a physical or mental object, and (3) challenging the Fregean notions that sense determines reference and that semantic form is equivalent to <b>logical</b> form. In <b>addition</b> to his general semantic theory, Katz worked out detailed accounts of presupposition, illocutionary force, idioms and names, and published authoritatively {{on the work of}} such philosophers as René Descartes, Gottlob Frege...|$|R
