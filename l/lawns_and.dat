5|$|The species' usual {{habitats}} include drylands, coastal sage scrub, {{and desert}} ecosystems. It also grows in <b>lawns</b> <b>and</b> fields. The {{range of the}} fungus is restricted to southwestern and western North America, where it fruits throughout the year, typically during or following cold, wet weather. Zeller gives a range that includes as its eastern border central Texas, and extends westward to San Diego County, California, and north to Josephine County, Oregon. The mushroom used to be common in the San Francisco Bay area before land development reduced its preferred habitats. A.deserticola has been collected in several states in northwestern Mexico, including Sonora, Chihuahua, and Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, <b>lawns,</b> <b>and</b> in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on <b>lawns</b> <b>and</b> gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

5|$|Paxillus involutus can {{be found}} growing on <b>lawns</b> <b>and</b> old meadows {{throughout}} its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, {{though they may be}} found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.|$|E
