40|$|The author {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> {{system of the}} Tembo, an agricultural people in eastern Zaire. The system consists of three basic rules: (1) one-day work should be exchanged with one-day work, and a monetary system is of no effect in the <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> system, (2) <b>labor</b> is <b>exchanged</b> between the same sex, and (3) <b>labor</b> is <b>exchanged</b> by a dynamic contract between two individuals. But these three rules alone are practically impossible, unless every member in the society has equal capacity of labor. The Tembo, therefore, have three modified systems of <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> to resolve some incongruity between the principles of <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> and inequality existing in the society:(1) "lukoo" system of offering labor as a gift; (2) "kwanza" system of paying back a feast instead of labor; (3) a system which works beyond the limitation of sex enabling deficient families to participate the <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> group. These three subsystems make the <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> system prevalent in the Tembo society...|$|R
40|$|In {{agricultural}} <b>labor</b> <b>exchange,</b> farmers temporarily pool {{their labor}} into teams and complete a task on each team member’s plot in succession. <b>Labor</b> time is <b>exchanged</b> between team members under strict reciprocity and without pay. The use of agricultural <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> {{in developing countries}} is widespread, but has received little attention from economists. This dissertation investigates the motivation {{for the formation of}} <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> teams by considering the individual farmer’s decision to participate. The analysis focuses on the two most prominent motivations for labor exchange: credit and labor market imperfections and the technological benefits of teamwork. A theoretical model of demand for <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> under factor market imperfections generalizes existing models of the organization of agricultural production by allowing for returns to teamwork and <b>labor</b> <b>exchange.</b> This generalization accounts for empirically relevant modes of production that were previously ruled out. The model establishes positive marginal returns to teamwork as a necessary condition for <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> when non-household <b>labor</b> exhibits moral hazard. The empirical analysis tests the implications of the model using primary data on agricultural households from Indonesia. Productio...|$|R

40|$|This chapter will {{describe}} noteworthy policy issues {{over the past}} decade that affected federal–state relations in the delivery of <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> services funded under the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. We will explain how the intergovernmental structure of the public employment service (ES) established under the Wagner-Peyser Act faced serious challenges during the 1990 s and ultimately was strengthened. This was an era aptly described by Nathan and Gais (2000) as Second Order Devolution—a type of federalism that extols the merits of local authority and privatization of government services. While we will focus primarily on <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> policy of the 1990 s, we also will summarize <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> policies from President Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930 s to President Reagan’s New Federalism of the 1980 s, and speculate on President George W. Bush’s <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> policy. The division of power between state and local control of workforce development programs is a pivotal issue of workforce federalism.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the functioning of}} the newly created <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> in post-Soviet Lithuania. It is argued that the <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> in post-Soviet Lithuania operates under the conditions of a structural contradiction: welfare services are designed to reintegrate unemployed into the labor force under the conditions of (a) increasing competitiveness of the labor markets and (b) a rapid decline of employment within the Lithuanian economy. As a result, labor redundancy is produced which consists predominantly of low skill/education individuals. Because the economy is unable to generate employment, job searches for this segment of the population are transformed into a highly bureaucratized and ritualized activities directed and supervised by the <b>labor</b> <b>exchange.</b> The purpose of the activities is to impose social order and control over those marginalized from the labor force via the creation of the divisions between deserving and undeserving poor. Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s theory of governmentality is used to examine two types of rituals employed by the labor exchange: individual and group based.

40|$|In Northern Vietnam, labour {{exchange}} {{is the most}} common form of collective work among farmers and is often used to perform tasks that require an intense labor force in the fields and for other collective tasks related to the social life of the villagers This paper analyses all aspects of this <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> among individuals and families in the village of Hay. We have found that this <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> is not simply an economic transaction among farmers, but instead a personal choice of individuals and families in relation to other villagers. One can for example accept or refuse to work for a particular family and one can invite only a particular family to participate in <b>labor</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this paper, we argue that reciprocity is indeed the basis of this <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> in which individuals and families participate in order to establish and reinforce bounds with some families inside and outside the village.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by The University of Chicago Press {{and can be}} found at: [URL] farmers rely on <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> to generate agricultural work when cash is rare and credit unavailable. Reciprocal altruism, biased by genetic kinship, has been implicated as the mechanism responsible for labor exchange; however, few empirical tests confirm this proposition. Competitive altruism could be operating if people differ in ability and use this information as a criterion for partnership selection. <b>Labor</b> <b>exchange</b> data are presented from a Dominican smallholder village over a 10 -month period within the village’s primary cash economic opportunity, bay oil production. Results indicate that competitive altruism better explains variation in <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> relationships and group size than reciprocal altruism and kinship, suggesting the presence of a biologic market for male exchange relationships. Bay oil laborers vary in altruistic behaviors, causing reputations for altruism to emerge. Men with reputations as high-quality altruists generate larger labor groups in bay oil production than do poor-quality ones. Larger groups induce bargaining wars, causing men to compete through altruistic acts, which allows high-quality individuals to discriminate potential partners for <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> relationships. Men with better reputations achieve more same-sex reciprocal partnerships but not a greater incidence of conjugal partnership, suggesting that male altruism is intra- but not intersexually selected...|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} been focused on the {{transformation}} process and the influencing factors of the changing of <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> arrangements which have been practiced among agrarian communities in rural Java. Practices of <b>labor</b> <b>exchanges</b> in rural Java have been experiencing the transformation process. In lowland areas, the expansion of off-farm jobs and technological changes in rice cultivation has deteriorated <b>labor</b> exchanges; <b>labor</b> <b>exchanges</b> have been almost totally replaced by hired labor. Meanwhile, in the uplands, with limited job opportunities and the introduction of mixed cropping, which demands collective work, <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> practices for various farming operations have strengthened considerably. Under geographical limitations and technological changes of mixed cropping system in upland areas, those have stimulated villagers to intensify traditional collective work arrangements such as sambatan and krubutan, which to some extent has been supplemented by the newly invented institution prayaan for completing farming and non-farming activities. The basic structures of the social relationships among villagers both in the upland and lowland hamlets bring about fewer difficulties in the arrangement of collective work for non-farming activities. However, villagers’ division of labor and diversification of income sources may enable well-off households to build modern houses, a process that will likely reduce the need for collective work in the future due to its need for highly skilled labor. Altruistic behavior in house construction is still very common among villagers in the uplands; in contrast, it has gradually disappeared among richer households in the lowland area...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that swidden {{agriculture}} {{has been the subject}} of decades of research, questions remain about the extent to which it is constrained by demographic growth and if it can adapt to environmental limits. In this dissertation I analyze ethnographic and ethnohistorical evidence from the Toledo District, Belize, and suggest that Q'eqchi' Maya swidden agriculture may be more ecologically adaptive than previously thought. I use social network analysis to examine farmer <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> networks from a chronosequence of five villages where swidden is used. Results suggest that changes in land-use patterns, network structure, and reciprocity rates may increase the system's resilience to changes in the forest's agricultural productivity. I develop a novel interpretation of labor reciprocity that highlights how unreciprocated exchanges, when they occur within the context of a social network, may limit overexploitation of a common property resource. These results are then interpreted in the context of panarchy theory; I suggest that the structural variability observed in <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> networks may explain how Q'eqchi' swidden maintains its identity under changing environmental conditions - a definition of resilience. Thus, the resulting picture of Q'eqchi' swidden is one of socioecological resilience rather than homeostasis; dynamic <b>labor</b> <b>exchange</b> networks help maintain a village's social cohesion, ultimately limiting pioneer settlements and slowing overall rates of deforestation. A historical and demographic analysis of market incursions into southern Belize supports this conclusion...|$|R
