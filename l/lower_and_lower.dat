25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work for a fraction of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E

500|$|.....To prepare Mau Piailug for the voyage, David Lewis briefed {{him on the}} {{geography}} of the islands {{in this part of}} the Pacific and the winds and currents that could be expected along the way, all information that an early Polynesian navigator acquainted with this route would have carried in his head. In addition, to alert Mau of how the elevation of stars above the northern and southern horizons would change as the canoe sailed farther and farther south, we held training sessions in Honolulu's Bishop Museum planetarium to graphically show how, for example, as one sailed toward Tahiti Polaris sank <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> on the northern horizon until it disappeared at the equator while the Southern Cross curved higher and higher in the sky. During his first few days of the voyage, Mau received further coaching on the pattern of winds and currents from Rodo Williams, a veteran Tahitian seaman on the crew who the year before had sailed a yacht from Tahiti to Hawaii and could therefore provide Mau with a firsthand account of what he could expect to encounter.|$|E
500|$|On 30 September 1942, Hauptmann Marseille {{was leading}} his Staffel on a Stuka escort mission {{covering}} {{the withdrawal of}} the group and relieving the outward escort, III./Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53), which had been deployed to support JG 27 in Africa. Marseille's flight was vectored onto Allied aircraft in the vicinity but the opponent withdrew and did not take up combat. Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader Werner Schröer claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30. While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded and half asphyxiated, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer Pöttgen.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} unusual parts of the cave is the Sand Garden, located about 3,000 feet (914m) from the entrance. [...] Here the floor of the cave is covered with sand. [...] The sand was carried into the cave by {{dripping}} water. [...] The sand is fine volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Mazama 6,600 years ago. [...] Rain and melting snow carried the ash down from the surface through cracks in the rock and deposited it {{on the floor of the}} cave one grain at a time. [...] Occasionally, enough water leaks into the cave to create a pool. [...] This allows the sand to spread out across the floor. [...] At the Sand Garden, the constant dripping of water has carved spires and pinnacles in the sand. [...] Since it takes hundreds of years to build these delicate sand forms, the Forest Service has fenced off the garden area to protect it. [...] The 2,211 feet (674m) of cave trail beyond the Sand Garden has a sandy floor. [...] Along the way, the ceiling descends <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> until the sand fills the cave. [...] The last 310 feet (95m) of the cave was dug out of the sand plug by two men in the 1930s. [...] Exploring this section of the cave requires visitors to crawl on hands and knees for much of the distance to the cave’s end, and usually takes at least thirty minutes.|$|E

2500|$|After the end {{of world}} War I some Caudron C.23s, a large trimotor night bomber, were {{modified}} to act as passenger aircraft, but the C.25 was the first aircraft Caudron had designed from the beginning to carry passengers. It was large, with a [...] span, so Caudron built in hinges to allow the wings to be folded for easier handling on the ground. The wings were rectangular in plan, mounted without stagger and fabric covered. It was a three bay biplane with unusually thin, wooden, parallel, vertical interplane struts, assisted by flying wires of thicker than usual gauge. [...] The engine mountings, two pairs of parallel struts, defined the inner bay. The outer pair of these struts were doubled since this was where the wing folded and so the ends of the wing either side of the fold retained their struts. [...] Four vertical cabane struts braced the centre of the upper wing from the upper fuselage. There were ailerons on both <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> planes, extending over more than half the span. These were not aerodynamically balanced in the usual way but were connected to each other by three vertical rods which halfway up were hinged to the trailing edge of a narrower and shorter horizontal surface which rotated about an axis well behind its aerodynamic centre. The wires from the cockpit operated these ancillary surfaces, which then moved the ailerons, just as the leading edge of a conventional balanced aileron, extending forward of the hinge, assists the pilot's input.|$|E

40|$|Background: For <b>lower</b> abdomen <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> limb surgery, spinal {{anaesthesia}} is most common modality used in routine. This {{study was conducted}} on 50 ASA 1 <b>and</b> 2 planned for <b>lower</b> limb <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> abdomen surgery. Methods: 50 patients of ASA 1 <b>and</b> 2 scheduled for <b>lower</b> limb <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> abdominal surgery were selected. Each patient received 4 milliliter volume of 0. 75 % isobaric ropivacaine + 5 microgram dexmedetomidine. At the intervals of 1 minute, 2 minute, 5 minute, 10 minute, 20 minute, 30 minute and 1 hour, 2 hour and 3 hour reading of pulse rate and blood pressure were recorded. Postoperatively, pain scores were recorded by using Visual Analogue Scale. Results: There were no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after induction. The combination of ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine provided better postoperative analgesia and reduced requirement of diclofenac injection in first 24 hour. Conclusions: The patients showed excellent hemodynamic stability and postoperative analgesia to ropivacaine + dexmedetomidine. Thus it is a safe modality for <b>lower</b> limb <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> abdomen surgery as far as haemodynamic effects and postoperative analgesia is concerned.
