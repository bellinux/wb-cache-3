5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, that God is infinite. His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's goodness is <b>limitless,</b> and as God's goodness is essential, God is also <b>limitless.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost <b>limitless</b> ways.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shaivism sect, {{the highest}} form of Shiva is formless, <b>limitless,</b> transcendent and unchanging {{absolute}} Brahman, and the primal Atman (soul, self) of the universe. Shiva has many benevolent and fearsome depictions. In benevolent aspects, he {{is depicted as}} an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash {{as well as a}} householder with wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva, regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and arts.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the review}} {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes and box-office website Box Office Mojo, Cooper's most critically and commercially successful films include Wedding Crashers (2005), The Hangover (2009), <b>Limitless</b> (2011), Silver Linings Playbook (2012), American Hustle (2013), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and American Sniper (2014).

5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, {{as he was}} used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had <b>limitless</b> production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect {{on the quality of the}} film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, seeking {{advice from}} the stone of the Terrenon. He is {{attacked}} on the way by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the stone of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him <b>limitless</b> knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost <b>limitless</b> set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in history, with {{contiguous}} territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase imperium sine fine ("empire without end") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Vergil's epic poem the Aeneid, <b>limitless</b> empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The canon {{itself is}} a mix of {{previous}} Daoist traditions, combining features from the Shangqing School and the Celestial Masters, along with other ancient texts and even some Buddhist ideas. The two most important texts of the canon besides the Wufujing are the Red Book of Five Writings (Chi shu wupian) and the Scripture of Upper Chapters on <b>Limitless</b> Salvation (Wuliang Duren Shangpin). According to Lu Xiujing, who edited the Lingbao Canon, there were a total of 34 texts in the canon, of which three have been lost.|$|E
5|$|While Cooper's film {{career began}} in 2001 with the cult film Wet Hot American Summer, his {{breakthrough}} performance {{came in the}} 2009 comedy The Hangover. Cooper was nominated for an MTV Movie Award and a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture. However, Cooper also won a Golden Raspberry Award that same year for his performance in All About Steve. The next two years saw Cooper receive nominations for his performances in various action and comedy films like The A-Team (2010), <b>Limitless,</b> and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011).|$|E
5|$|While {{camouflage}} tricks are {{in principle}} <b>limitless,</b> both cost and practical considerations limit {{the choice of}} methods and {{the time and effort}} devoted to camouflage. Paint and uniforms must also protect vehicles and soldiers from the elements. Units need to move, fire their weapons and perform other tasks to keep functional, some of which run counter to camouflage. Camouflage may be dropped altogether. Late in the Second World War, the USAAF abandoned camouflage paint for some aircraft to lure enemy fighters to attack, while in the Cold War, some aircraft similarly flew with polished metal skins, to reduce drag and weight, or to reduce vulnerability to radiation from nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of <b>limitless</b> energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{portrayal}} of a struggling writer in the thriller <b>Limitless</b> (2011) and a rookie police officer in the crime drama The Place Beyond the Pines (2012) drew praise from critics. He found greater success with the romantic comedy-drama Silver Linings Playbook (2012), the black comedy crime film American Hustle (2013), and the biopic American Sniper (2014). For his work in these films, Cooper was nominated for Academy Awards—two Best Actor, one Best Supporting Actor, and one Best Picture. Cooper became the tenth actor to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. In 2014, he portrayed Joseph Merrick in a Broadway revival of The Elephant Man, garnering a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporting}} part in {{the commercially}} successful comedy Wedding Crashers (2005) improved his career prospects, but also led to him being typecast as the best friend to the main character in such comedies as Failure to Launch (2006), The Rocker (2008), and He's Just Not That Into You (2009). During this period, Cooper also continued starring in television shows, such as the 2005 sitcom Kitchen Confidential, and played a dual role in a 2006 onstage production of Three Days of Rain. However, the former was cancelled after four episodes due to low ratings. His breakthrough came {{with the role of}} a reckless teacher in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009), which became one of the highest grossing R-rated films of all time. Cooper continued to take on parts in several box office hits, including The A-Team (2010), <b>Limitless,</b> and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011).|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with <b>limitless</b> space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman {{confirmed}} to Variety {{that they are}} no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and <b>Limitless</b> was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. {{is set in}} a western-themed {{environment}} with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow's manga series, Trigun. The most prominent characters in the series are powder hunters, individuals who seek the titular zombie powder. The zombie powder is a life-giving substance that can imbue an individual with <b>limitless</b> life force, grant them immortality, and even raise people from the dead. Zombie powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead. These rings are dangerous magical artifacts that, individually, devour the life force of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose. This stolen life energy is converted into the zombie powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the Dead are brought together.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the <b>limitless</b> apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E

The microscope is used to identify and compare fibers, hairs, soils, and dust…etc.|$|E
25|$|Sarracenia do not self-pollinate and {{therefore}} require hand pollination or access to natural pollinators such as bees. Sarracenia pollen remains potent {{for several weeks}} when refrigerated, and so is stored by cultivators and used to pollinate later-flowering species. Given that all Sarracenia hybrids are fertile and will hybridize further, this characteristic allows cultivators to produce a <b>limitless</b> number of variants through hybridization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limitless</b> is an American comedy-drama {{television}} series {{based on the}} 2011 film of the same name, which originally aired on CBS from September 22, 2015 to April 26, 2016.

25|$|The {{infinite}} canvas {{refers to}} the potentially <b>limitless</b> space that is available to webcomics presented on the World Wide Web. The term was introduced by Scott McCloud in his 2000 book Reinventing Comics, in which he suggested that webcomic creators could make a Web page as large as needed to contain a comic page of any conceivable size. This infinite canvas would create an endless amount of storytelling benefits and would allow creators much more freedom in how they present their artwork.|$|E
25|$|A {{major feature}} of its post-scarcity society, the Culture is {{obviously}} able to gather, manipulate, transfer and store {{vast amounts of}} energy. While not explained in detail in the novels, this involves antimatter and 'grid energy', a postulated energy field dividing the universe from a mirroring anti-matter universe, and providing practically <b>limitless</b> energy. Transmission or storage of such energy is not explained, though these capabilities must be powerful as well, with tiny drones capable of very powerful manipulatory fields and forces.|$|E
