25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entr√©e that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, I <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall on my inside banquette {{and looked at}} him in frank astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Blake made {{a sudden}} movement, and then <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railing.|$|E
60|$|Thacker <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{wall and}} held his glass up to the light.|$|E
50|$|The West Asian Arab region {{comprises}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{most of the}} Levant (excluding Cyprus and Israel), most of Mesopotamia (excluding parts of Turkey and Iran) and the Persian Gulf region. The peninsula is roughly a tilted rectangle that <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> slope of northeast Africa, the long axis pointing toward Turkey and Europe.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped his}} arm, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall behind her.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{declined}} {{the chair to}} which I waved him. He <b>leaned</b> slightly <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table, facing me.|$|R
60|$|He {{wrote the}} letters down, while Jackson <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, in patient quiet.|$|E
60|$|He kicked {{one foot}} out, and disgustedly {{contemplated}} a burst white shoe, while the duck trousers cracked. Valentine <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bulkhead and laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "St. John's!" [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{piano and}} laughed unrestrainedly. [...] "That's a good one, {{to think how}} {{straight}} I've been talking to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Boston's a great place," [...] Ransom rejoined inattentively. He was not {{listening}} to the policeman or to the organ now, {{for the sound of}} voices had reached him {{from the other side of}} the door. The policeman took no further notice of it than to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> panels, with folded arms; and there was another pause, between them, during which the playing of the organ ceased.|$|R
60|$|Some of them {{squatted down}} in the muddy road, the luckier ones managed to <b>lean</b> their <b>backs</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> slimy walls.|$|R
60|$|Anna spoke earnestly, and {{her face}} quite shone with {{friendly}} zeal; while her eyes were full of unspoken admiration and regard for this friend, who seemed tottering {{on the verge of}} a precipice. She expected a serious reply,--thanks, at least, for her interest; and great was her surprise to see Frank <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> vine-wreathed pillar behind him, and laugh till a shower of rose-leaves came fluttering down on both their heads.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> window, but, {{in spite of}} his usual {{listless}} manner, they almost fancied that the face in shadow was a little pale.|$|E
60|$|Her grip relaxed. Her hands dropped {{slowly to}} her side. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> circle of his arms, {{and looked up}} at him--a strange look, full of a sweet humility.|$|E
60|$|Lady Glyde was {{not strong}} enough to bear the {{surprise}} of this extraordinary statement. She turned fearfully pale, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, looking at her husband in dead silence.|$|E
60|$|Her head drooped. She shivered as if {{the cold}} night air had struck her, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> wearily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> parapet of the wall.|$|R
60|$|All of {{the company}} save Dickey and Johnny seated {{themselves}} at the table, and began to make a hearty but hurried meal. Johnny stood up in a careful manner, and got along very well, but poor Dickey could neither sit down nor help himself. He made one or two vain efforts {{to pick up a}} biscuit from the table, but his armor would not permit, and he was about to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall in helpless indignation, when Mrs. Green noticed him.|$|R
60|$|Isaac's head ached and throbbed so {{that after}} he had {{satisfied}} his thirst and hunger {{he was glad to}} close his eyes and <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree. Engrossed in thoughts of the home he might never see again, he had lain there an hour without moving, when he was aroused from his meditations by low guttural exclamations from the Indians. Opening his eyes he saw Crow and another Indian enter the glade, leading and half supporting a third savage.|$|R
60|$|As for Stephen, he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{framework}} of the conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,--love, rage, and confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that he had offended Maggie.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} in the window-sill and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> corner. She had slept well, and she was not afraid of the sunshine--blue, too, was her most {{becoming}} colour. He looked at her admiringly.|$|E
60|$|She {{withdrew from}} {{his arms and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> corner of the sofa. It was {{absolutely}} necessary to say what was gnawing at her heart-strings, but she felt ashamed and could not look at him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do you mean?' said Bounderby, {{getting up}} to <b>lean</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> chimney-piece. 'What are you talking about? You took her for better for worse.' ...|$|R
50|$|For a {{good portion}} of <b>the</b> fight <b>against</b> Foreman, Ali <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ropes and covers up, letting Foreman wildly throw punches at him. During the fight, Ali realizes that he has to react sooner or else he will be knocked out or {{possibly}} die in the ring. As the rounds go on, Foreman tires himself out and Ali takes advantage. He quickly knocks out the tired Foreman, and the film ends with Ali regaining the Heavyweight Championship of which he was previously stripped.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{commercial}} tuna fishing, ca. 1920. A large fish seems {{to fly to}} the left {{to the right of}} center. Three men seem to be pulling at the fish with three poles attached to one hook. <b>The</b> three men <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls of the boat while water covers their knees. The men appear to stand in water at {{the outer edge of the}} boat. An additional three men stand behind them with fishing poles in hand. To the right, the water rages while the boat on the left is loaded with catch...|$|R
60|$|A violent fit of {{coughing}} doubled Omar up, and {{he rocked}} himself to and fro, wheezing and moaning in turns, while Babalatchi {{and the girl}} {{looked at him in}} silence. Then he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree, exhausted.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> logs, and chuckled so complacently {{at his own}} conceit that it {{was hard}} to believe this easy-tempered {{creature}} was draining half my neighbors' blood; but I was filled with a great loathing for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} get off, I suppose," [...] she said. [...] "I don't believe I'm going any farther." [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{bars of the}} bench, and put up one of her slim arms along the top.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} in a corner of <b>the</b> coop, <b>leaned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before she closed her eyes, and was asleep in half a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is enough, Rujub," [...] Bathurst said, for he felt Isobel <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hand {{which he}} {{held at the}} back of her chair, and felt sure that she had fainted.|$|R
6000|$|The big Scotchman {{held his}} little {{opponent}} in contempt; so that, {{instead of putting}} himself on the defensive, he <b>leaned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door, thrust {{his hands into his}} pockets, and requested to know [...] "what that was to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good merchant, perhaps I might; but I don't {{particularly}} want to know," [...] {{said the}} slave, as he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gate, leisurely striking {{with his long}} sword at the night-bugs and beetles that were buzzing about.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bed-rail. [...] "Well, it's in your hands," [...] {{and his own}} made a writhing movement. [...] "I've {{been through}} it. You needn't hit too hard--it isn't worth while. I've been frightened; I've been frightened, Freddie." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cushions, {{trying to}} achieve a coolness of mind and body. But {{the heat of the}} day kept him unpleasantly soluble, and dismay, that {{perspiration}} of the soul, refused to be absorbed by the pocket-handkerchief of philosophy.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> farther <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree, with {{a little}} {{whimsical}} smile. It was pleasant to appear as a modern Ulysses {{in the eyes of}} a very pretty girl, but he had, as she was quick to recognize, taken up the role unconsciously.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you live, as I understand, over at {{the pretty}} little cottage. It is very {{nice of you to}} call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get on, but still the {{intention}} is equally good." [...] She crossed her legs and <b>leaned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> marble mantelpiece.|$|R
60|$|Evidently {{the wolf}} {{imagined}} that its time had now come, for it sneaked {{out of the}} wood when the hunter fell, and began cautiously to advance. But Dan saw this, and, making a desperate effort, arose to a sitting posture, <b>leaned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bank, and placed his gun across his knees.|$|R
