5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a <b>lot</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

500|$|In March 1970, the {{two houses}} reached a {{compromise}} whereby 150 million dollars would be {{struck in the}} 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, {{with the aid of}} Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get". The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.|$|E
500|$|Desegregation in Birmingham {{took place}} slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the {{campaign}} with promises {{that were too}} vague and [...] "settling for a <b>lot</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> even moderate demands". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted {{the terms of the}} agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90days from May 15. [...] Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. [...] Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. [...] Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. [...] However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.|$|E

If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density, a space habitat the size of the L5 Society's proposed O'Neill cylinder—500km2, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3 tons—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4 kg. For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a <b>lot</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> many asteroids.

500|$|There was {{doubt about}} the future of the Arms Park after 2010 {{following}} the move of the Cardiff Blues to the Cardiff City Stadium. Cardiff RFC Ltd, the company that runs Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC, still has a 15-year lease on the Arms Park, but talks are underway to release the rugby club from the terms of the lease, to enable the Millennium Stadium to be redeveloped with a new North Stand and adjoining convention centre. However, it still has the original requirement on the lease, that the land will only be used for [...] "recreational purposes", as stipulated by the Bute family. But the Arms Park site is a prime piece of real estate in the centre of Cardiff, which means that it may be difficult to sell the land to property developers. The estimated value of the whole Arms Park site could be at least £25million, although with the [...] "recreational use" [...] requirement, its actual value could be a <b>lot</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that figure. A decision by Cardiff Athletic Club on the future of the Arms Park has yet to be made. In 2011, the Cardiff Blues regional rugby union team made a £6million bid for the Arms Park, later the WRU made an increased bid of £10million for the site. Both bids were rejected by the trustees of the Cardiff Athletic Club. However, in 2012 Cardiff Blues announced that they would be making a permanent return to Cardiff Arms Park following declining attendances at the Cardiff City Stadium. In the 2013 off-season, the pitch at the Arms Park will be replaced with an artificial FieldTurf surface in time for the start of the 2013–14 season. This change is intended to prevent any adverse weather conditions from affecting the rugby.|$|E
