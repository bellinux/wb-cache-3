5|$|Inside {{the public}} <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} were walls and floors made of light tan Botticino marble, {{the latter in}} a terrazzo pattern. The rest of the building used rubber tile for flooring, colored green and brown.

5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.

5|$|Construction on the Modernist {{hotel was}} to have started {{in the spring of}} 1970. However, {{construction}} on the , $23 million hotel and office building did not begin until June 1971. The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were not provided. The hotel would occupy the top four floors and <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate.

40|$|What role does <b>the</b> {{provision}} <b>of</b> {{information by}} {{special interest groups}} play in changing public perceptions about environmental issues, and on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> public policy? To date, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental policy literature has focussed on lobbying efforts by special interest groups in which direct policy contingent contributions are made to the government. However, spending by special interest groups, in particular those representing environmental concerns, is often not directed towards the government, but instead towards policies aimed at influencing the public’s beliefs regarding the extent and severity of environmental damage. This paper presents a model <b>of</b> strategic <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and the public by special interest groups with opposing environmental concerns. Building on Yu (2005), we consider the case where a polluting firm and an environmental lobby send costly messages to a relatively uniformed public about environmental damage (indirect lobbying). At the same time, the firm can engage in direct <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government by making policy contingent contributions (direct lobbying). As such...|$|R

In March 2002, a robbery took place in the <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into the <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E

When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, {{the doors of the}} presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night.

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) by South African companies. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to establish the timing and methods <b>of</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IASB by South African companies. Central to this study was <b>the</b> seminal work <b>of</b> Sutton (1984), predicting when and how companies lobby an accounting standard-setter.

5|$|The {{result was}} a non-hierarchical, organic {{collection}} of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people.

5|$|In November 1909, {{industrialist}} Ambrose O'Brien of Renfrew, Ontario, was in Montreal {{to purchase}} supplies for a railway contract. At {{the request of}} the Renfrew Creamery Kings hockey team, he attended the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) meetings, held at the Windsor Hotel, to represent Renfrew in its application to join the league. At the meeting, the ECHA team owners rejected Renfrew's application. Later that day the ECHA's owners chose to disband their league and form the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in a bid to exclude the Montreal Wanderers, who had upset the other owners when they moved into a smaller arena that would reduce the visiting team's share of gate receipts. In the <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel, O'Brien met Jimmy Gardner, manager of the Wanderers, and discussed forming a new league which would include Renfrew, the Wanderers, and two teams that O'Brien owned in the Ontario mining towns of Cobalt and Haileybury. Gardner suggested that O'Brien start a team of francophone players based in Montreal, forming a rivalry with the Wanderers. As a result, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was founded on December 2, 1909, and Les Canadiens were created two days later, initially financed by O'Brien with the intent of transferring ownership to francophone sportsmen in Montreal as soon as possible.|$|E
