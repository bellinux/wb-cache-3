5|$|In 1534, Tabinshwehti and {{his deputy}} Bayinnaung, {{then a couple}} of 18-year-olds, <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> first {{military}} campaign against Hanthawaddy. It {{was the first of}} a series of wars by Toungoo that would engulf western and central mainland Southeast Asia for the next 80 years. In 1538–39, the upstart kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing). Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common border in the upper-Tenasserim coast.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Tashlin cast Mansfield in {{the film}} version of the Broadway show Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? reprising her role of Rita Marlowe {{alongside}} co-stars Tony Randall and Joan Blondell. Fox <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> new blonde bombshell with a forty-day sixteen-country tour of Europe for the studio. She attended the premiere of the film (released as Oh!

5|$|In May 1943, the Axis {{powers of}} Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were {{defeated}} in the North African Campaign. Two months later, the Allied powers of Great Britain and the United States successfully <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky.

5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division {{was heavily}} engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The {{divisions}} clashes {{centered on the}} town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On 5 August, the North Koreans <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> attack, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. At 19:30 on 6 August, the South Koreans launched a counteroffensive to retake the hill.|$|E
5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> own attack.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July 1943, the Soviets <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling {{any chance}} of German victory or even {{stalemate}} in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk {{marked the end of}} German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensives.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 2016, {{the club}} <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> new third away kit for the 2016–17 Premier League season. It {{featured}} in their 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign {{and was also}} use in Leicester's debut match in the competition. The design took inspiration from the 1983–84 kit, and boasts a clean white design with thin blue pinstripes on the shirt, {{as well as a}} textured form stripe design across both the shirt and shorts.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> final {{offensive}} against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{had already}} <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> carrier {{aircraft}} against the Japanese. Fletcher, in overall command aboard Yorktown, and benefiting from PBY sighting {{reports from the}} early morning, ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical, while initially holding Yorktown in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found.|$|E
5|$|The three Soviet Baltic Fronts <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> Riga Offensive Operation on 14 September, {{along the}} German 18th Army front segment {{from the town}} of Madona in Latvia to the mouth of the Väike Emajõgi river. In the Estonian section, from the Valga railway {{junction}} to Lake Võrtsjärv, the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front attacked the German XXVIII Army Corps. The German and Estonian Omakaitse units held their positions and prevented the Army Detachment Narwa from being encircled in Estonia.|$|E

5|$|After {{a week of}} fighting, the Soviets <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> counteroffensives– Operation Kutuzov on the {{northern}} side and a coinciding one on the southern side. On the southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS-Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, resulting in a large clash of armour. The 5th Guards Tank Army suffered significant losses in the attack, but succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt– the last heavily fortified one. The German high command, unable to accomplish its objective, cancelled Operation Citadel and began redeploying its forces to deal with new pressing developments elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Cousse's message {{confirmed}} {{the fears of}} Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud was intent on taking over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal {{to the international community}} to end the French advance. On 23 July, Al-'Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units. French forces <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} losses, {{in early}} 1942 Germany {{and its allies}} stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then <b>launched</b> <b>their</b> main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.|$|E
