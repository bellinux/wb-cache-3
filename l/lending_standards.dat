Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation.

25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007. Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding shadow banking system, which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels of leverage. This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher home prices. Since the bubble burst, {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, <b>lending</b> <b>standards</b> are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} economy following {{the withdrawal of}} the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. On January 1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his veto of legislation had he deemed extravagant. However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the Panic of 1837. Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their <b>lending</b> <b>standards.</b> Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} combat the {{escalating}} problem of predatory lending, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), a federal regulator of the national banking industry, issued a Final Rule in 2004 which sets forth a uniform federal standard to guide banking policies on predatory practices and to aid regulator’s identification of predatory loans. The anti-predatory standard states that “a national bank shall not make a consumer loan... based predominantly on the bank’s realization of the foreclosure or liquidation value of the borrower’s collateral, {{without regard to the}} borrower’s ability to repay the loan according to its terms” (“the Standard”). This Comment analyzes the potential ineffectiveness and possible consequences of the OCC’s anti-predatory <b>lending</b> <b>standard.</b> The author concludes that the OCC’s preemption of state anti-predatory lending laws and substitution of a single anti-predatory <b>lending</b> <b>standard</b> cannot reasonably be justified by the OCC’s policy reasons for adopting the Standard. Moreover, the Standard places an unjustifiable restriction on the ability of banks to extend loans to low-income individuals. As such, the author proposes that the OCC should interpret the Standard so that it does not prohibit banks from extending loans to all low-income borrowers, and prohibits only those loans extended with an intent to foreclose on the borrowers collateral...|$|R

40|$|Credit card lending in Asia {{has grown}} rapidly since the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis and has much room to expand. But this growth {{so far has}} seen several episodes of sharp booms and busts, posing new risks to financial stability. This paper attempts {{to learn more about}} the credit card markets and shed light on and draw lessons from some of the core common elements in the three recent episodes of credit card lending distress in Asia. Of the episodes in Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan during the 2000 s, Korea experienced the most serious boom-bust cycle in 2003. Therefore we take a closer look at the credit card lending crisis there. Easy monetary conditions, financial liberalisation, economies of scales in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms of the principal-agent problem, and the seasoning effect of a fast-growing lending portfolio all contributed to unsustainable credit lending boom. Eventually, excessive indebtedness led to rising credit cost and caused greater caution, tighter <b>lending</b> <b>standard,</b> contracting credit, further credit loss, prolonged balance sheet adjustments, risks to the broader financial system and damages to the real economy.

2500|$|The {{growth of}} private-label {{securitization}} {{and lack of}} regulation {{in this part of}} the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter <b>lending</b> <b>standards</b> made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that [...] "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system". The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{and private sectors}} are increasingly considering "biodiversity offsets" as a strategy to compensate for their negative impacts on biodiversity, including impacts on great apes and their habitats in Africa. In the absence of national offset policies in sub-Saharan Africa, offset design and implementation are guided by company internal <b>standards,</b> <b>lending</b> bank <b>standards</b> or international best practice principles. We examine four projects in Africa that are seeking to compensate for their negative impacts on great ape populations.

Even if they were to follow currently accepted best-practice principles, we find that these actions may still fail to contribute to conservation objectives over the long term. We advocate for an alternative approach in which biodiversity offset and compensation projects are designed and implemented as part of a National Offset Strategy that (1) takes into account the cumulative impacts of development in individual countries, (2) identifies priority offset sites, (3) promotes aggregated offsets, and (4) integrates biodiversity offset and compensation projects with national biodiversity conservation objectives. We also propose supplementary principles necessary for biodiversity offsets to contribute to great ape conservation in Africa.
