5|$|Harrison's first marriage, {{to model}} Pattie Boyd in 1966, {{ended in divorce}} in 1977. The {{following}} year he married Olivia Harrison (née Arias), {{with whom he had}} one son, Dhani. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer attributed to years of cigarette smoking. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He <b>left</b> <b>an</b> estate of almost £100 million.|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers <b>left</b> <b>an</b> inscription.|$|E
5|$|In Antigua and Barbuda, {{there was}} {{considerable}} flooding of major roads and 2,000people were severely affected and were evacuated. About 516 of the people were housed in emergency shelters. Across the island, the storm killed one person, injured 12, <b>left</b> <b>an</b> elderly blind man missing, and destroyed 500houses and a newly built church. In the village of Crab's Hill, 64of the 81houses were ether seriously damaged or destroyed. The hurricane also disrupted 50% of telephone service and 90% of the homes were left without electricity. A wind gust of 102mph (164km/h) was reported by the Antigua and Barbuda Meteorological Service on October20.|$|E
50|$|The holotype, CV OO722, {{was found}} in a layer of the late Upper Shaximiao Formation, {{probably}} dating from the early Kimmeridgian. It consists of a partial skeleton including a fragmentary skull, of an adult individual. It contains a number of individual dorsal vertebrae, a series of dorsal vertebrae found in articulation with the sacrum and pelvis, seven tail vertebrae, ribs, seven chevrons, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> scapulocoracoid, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> humerus, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> radius, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> second metacarpal, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> thighbone, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> shinbone, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> fibula, metacarpals, <b>a</b> phalanx, several back plates and <b>a</b> <b>left</b> shoulder spine. The main lacking parts are the neck and the tail end. The skull bones found are so fragmentary that they provide little relevant information. A 2006 paper by Susannah Maidment states that the only fossil specimen could not be located.|$|R

5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (<b>left),</b> <b>an</b> object {{orbiting}} a young companion star at {{a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, Bosanquet was a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Flying Corps. On 5 April 1924, he married Mary Janet Kennedy-Jones, {{the daughter of a}} Member of Parliament.

When his father died, Bosanquet sold the family home in Middlesex and moved to Wykehurst Farm, Surrey, where he died on 12 October 1936. He <b>left</b> <b>an</b> estate valued at £2,276 0s. 4d.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} <b>left</b> <b>an</b> unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found {{not to have any}} of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E

5|$|Many former US Highways in Michigan have <b>left</b> <b>an</b> M-numbered highway {{with the}} same number as a relic of their existence. For example, M-27 runs along a portion of former US27. In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways {{with the same}} designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he <b>left</b> <b>an</b> endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|Some of the company's performers, {{over the}} decades, became stars {{of their day}} and often moved on to careers in musical theatre or grand opera.

5|$|The Jesuits <b>left</b> <b>an</b> {{extension}} of the epistle transept used as living quarters. In 1872, it was expanded to become a proper convento under Father Cabañas. The convento is a typical bahay-na-bato with its first floor made out of coral stones and egg white mixed with plaster as binder and the second floor made out of light materials like bamboo. The convent which serves as the priest's house, it is much used as the church's ecclesiastical museum.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenoi {{also made}} a {{significant}} contribution to the history of Asia Minor. By reconquering much of the region, the Komnenoi set back the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries. In the process, they planted the foundations of the Byzantine successor states of Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has <b>left</b> <b>an</b> enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E
5|$|The Senghenydd {{explosion}} {{remains the}} worst mining disaster in Britain. The deaths of 440 men {{on a small}} community had a devastating effect; 60 victims were younger than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost their fathers and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while {{the death of one}} father and son <b>left</b> <b>an</b> 18-year-old daughter to raise her 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger.|$|E

5|$|The monastery was {{composed}} of six churches, gavit, narthex, (nakhasrah), and other structures. The main church of Varagavank was called Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God). It dated to the 11th century and was similar in plan to the prominent Saint Hripsime Church in Vagharshapat. The earliest structure was on {{the southern part of}} the ensemble and was known as Surb Sopia (10th century). Queen Khushush <b>left</b> <b>an</b> inscription (dated 981) on its western wall.|$|E
5|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diệm regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with their bare hands. The protesters fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and their bare fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were fired at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế <b>left</b> <b>an</b> estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E
