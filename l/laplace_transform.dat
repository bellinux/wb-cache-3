40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{time-dependent}} behavior of an $M/M/c$ priority queue having two customer classes, class-dependent service rates, and preemptive priority between classes. More particularly, we develop {{a method that}} determines the <b>Laplace</b> <b>transforms</b> of the transition functions when the system is initially empty. The <b>Laplace</b> <b>transforms</b> corresponding to states with at least $c$ high-priority customers are expressed explicitly {{in terms of the}} <b>Laplace</b> <b>transforms</b> corresponding to states with at most $c - 1 $ high-priority customers. We then show how to compute the remaining <b>Laplace</b> <b>transforms</b> recursively, by making use of a variant of Ramaswami's formula from the theory of $M/G/ 1 $-type Markov processes. While the primary focus of our work is on deriving <b>Laplace</b> <b>transforms</b> of transition functions, analogous results can be derived for the stationary distribution: these results seem to yield the most explicit expressions known to date.
