5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{occurred during}} World War II, with activity from a German U-boat {{expected in the}} Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations for issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily censored by the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers about the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of this storm was published in Texas and Louisiana. After {{the loss of life}} in this storm, the Government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
5|$|Workers in Cairns had {{restored}} {{power and}} water supplies {{within a few}} days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60million due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and water shortages. Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy {{as a result of the}} effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding, and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms.|$|E

25|$|A part of {{the upper}} Darling River system {{collapsed}} during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting {{to a series of}} ponds. Across the state more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland was drought declared. The flow past Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> The town of Warwick was particularly affected.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{productivity}} at numerous factories was affected. Among them, {{steel and}} aluminum production were scaled back {{due to a}} significant shortage of raw materials and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of about 50,000 tonnes of lead and zinc was forecasted in Hunan. Telecom companies had significant repair costs as about 10,000kilometers of lines were affected. The Ministry of Information Industry mentioned that this has affected 33million users and cost at least 80million yuan up until 27 January. Other sectors affected were hotels, airlines and auto sales while other businesses had disruption in the supply of products because of transportation delays.

40|$|Supply chain {{system is}} an {{integrated}} <b>production</b> system <b>of</b> a product. In the past researches, this system was often {{assumed to be}} an equilibrium structure, but in real production process, some members in this system usually cannot effectively complete their <b>production</b> task because <b>of</b> the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> which will reduce {{the performance of the}} whole supply chain production system. This supply chain with the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is called the defective supply chain (DSC) system. This research will discuss the partner selection and the production-distribution planning in this DSC network system. Besides the cost <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and transportation, the reliability of the structure and the unbalance of this system caused by the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are considered. Then a germane mathematical programming model is developed for solving this problem. Due to the complex problem and {{in order to get a}} satisfactory near-optimal solution with great speed, this research proposes seeking the solution with the solving model based on ant colony algorithm. The application results in real cases show that the solving model presented by this research can quickly and effectively plan the most suitable type of the DSC network and decision-making of the production-distribution. Finally, a comparative numerical experiment is performed by using the proposed approach and the common single-phase ant colony algorithm (SAC) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. The analysis results show that the proposed approach can outperform the SAC in partner selection and production-distribution planning for DSC network design.

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{air power}} theorists like Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating {{the need for}} land and sea fighting. It was thought that bombers would always get through {{and could not be}} resisted, {{particularly}} at night. Industry, seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.|$|E
25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and {{underlying}} tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids. Larval Hypoderma warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep.

There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.|$|E
25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is {{going to depend on}} a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} it was {{apparent}} that considerable subsidence was being caused by mining in the built-up area of Manchester around Bradford Colliery. Many buildings were affected, particularly in Bradford village and Miles Platting, where in 1962 eleven council houses were so severely damaged they had to be demolished. The government approved an order restricting mining operations and ordered an enquiry to determine whether mining should continue unhindered, and if not whether compensation for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> should be paid; for the first time, the NCB required planning permission to mine under the city of Manchester. The NCB gave evidence to the enquiry in 1966 stating that for each ton of coal extracted from the colliery 5s 2d had to be paid out in compensation for surface damage– the highest for any pit in the region– contrasted with a national average of 6d per ton. The NCB's plans for the colliery included extending the mines beneath Collyhurst, Cheetham, and Ancoats, but the risk of causing yet more subsidence proved to be unacceptable. Therefore, despite sitting on [...] "vast reserves of premium coal", Bradford Colliery was closed in 1968 as being uneconomic.
