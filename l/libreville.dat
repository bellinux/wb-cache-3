5|$|Little {{is known}} of Goundjout's life between his 1966 {{acquittal}} and death on 1 July 1990, in <b>Libreville.</b> He is buried in <b>Libreville</b> near his wife Odette (d. 2006), a former fashion model. A secondary school {{has been established in}} his name.|$|E
5|$|Born into a Fang family near <b>Libreville,</b> Aubame {{lost his}} father at eight {{years of age and}} his mother at eleven. Abbé Jean Obame, stepbrother of Léon M'ba, looked after the {{orphaned}} Aubame and arranged for schooling at several Roman Catholic missions. After he graduated, Aubame became a schoolteacher.|$|E
5|$|Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave {{instructions}} to transfer M'ba to Ndjolé, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed {{president and his}} captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to <b>Libreville.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of <b>Libreville</b> on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in <b>Libreville.</b> A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of <b>Libreville,</b> for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|M'ba {{helped get}} him a job in customs on 24 March 1931. First {{appointed}} to <b>Libreville</b> from 1931 to 1935, he was transferred to Bangui in 1935 and then to Brazzaville in 1936, where he co-founded {{a branch of the}} Mutuelle Gabonaise with a brother of politician Louis Bigmann. He was {{also a member of the}} Association des fonctionnaires, an organization which was dominated by two other soon-to-be politicians: René-Paul Sousatte and Jean Rémy Ayouné.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the speech}} given by Charles de Gaulle on the Appeal of 18 June 1940, Aubame {{sided with the}} Free French, and in November was sent by <b>Libreville</b> {{authorities}} to rally Fangs for the cause. In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame's reward was {{to be one of}} several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre's first {{assignment}} as a Holy Ghost Father was as {{a professor}} at St. John's Seminary in <b>Libreville,</b> Gabon. In 1934 he was made rector of the seminary. On 28 September 1935 he made his perpetual vows. He served as superior {{of a number of}} missions of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Gabon. In October 1945 Lefebvre was ordered by the superior general to return to France and take up new duties as rector of the Holy Ghost Fathers seminary in Mortain.|$|E

In Paris, President Charles de Gaulle decided against the plea.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were {{released}} {{at the request}} of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was in a car with U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent this to him via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in Gabon at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to <b>Libreville</b> on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio <b>Libreville</b> that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before this alleged incident.|$|E
5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of <b>Libreville.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sweeping through <b>Libreville</b> unopposed, {{the troops}} easily {{captured}} the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka {{military base in}} Lambaréné when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning of the impending attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what had been going on. Cousseran dodged answering the question and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The truck was loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of <b>Libreville,</b> the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a curfew}} {{imposed by the}} government, {{violence}} and looting continued in Port-Gentil {{in the days after}} the announcement of results. By 5 September, two people were reported killed there and Total evacuated most of its foreign employees to <b>Libreville.</b> Also on 5 September, Bongo attended a Cameroon–Gabon football match at the Omar Bongo Stadium in <b>Libreville</b> and then spoke to Radio France Internationale, stressing the importance of calm and saying that his opponents should pursue legal avenues if they had complaints. Meanwhile, Mba Obame and Myboto emerged from hiding to attend an opposition meeting, although Mamboundou did not. According to Mamboundou ally Louis-Gaston Mayila, Mamboundou suffered an arm injury at a demonstration in <b>Libreville,</b> during which the police fired tear gas, and then went into hiding. Communications Minister Gondjout said that Mamboundou was unharmed, however. Although protesters burned cars and set up barricades in <b>Libreville,</b> security forces were in clear control of the streets by the end of the day. Additional violence was reported in Nkembo, located east of <b>Libreville.</b> Meanwhile, Gabonese students in Dakar set fire to Gabon's embassy in Senegal.|$|E
