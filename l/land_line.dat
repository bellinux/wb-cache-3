5|$|In Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Army in April 1942, Herring {{was given}} command of Northern Territory Force. At this time Darwin was {{being subjected to}} Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was impractical, Herring developed a <b>land</b> <b>line</b> of communications running across the outback from Alice Springs.|$|E
5|$|While New Guinea Force {{wished to}} pursue the Japanese, {{logistical}} difficulties precluded this. The Japanese prepared to make another attempt to capture Wau. This time, {{the plan was to}} approach from the north, building a road from Markham Point to the Snake River Valley. From there the advance would have headed down the valley to Wau. The 51st Division was earmarked for the mission, but it suffered heavy losses en route to New Guinea in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. This impressed the Japanese command with the dangers from Allied air power. A new plan was therefore devised under which a <b>land</b> <b>line</b> of communication was to be established running down the Ramu and Markham Valleys. In June, Adachi was ordered to prepare to capture Wau. Road construction was carried out at great hardship to the troops involved, but the road was still incomplete when the Allied landings at Nadzab and Lae caused work to be suspended. For the Allies, Wau became an important jumping off point for the Salamaua-Lae campaign.|$|E

25|$|Another {{supercell}} storm struck Tyneside {{without warning}} {{at the height}} of the evening rush hour causing widespread damage and travel chaos, locally known as the Toon Monsoon. Flooded shopping malls were evacuated, Newcastle station was closed, as was the Tyne & Wear Metro, and main road routes were flooded leading to massive tailbacks. Drivers were forced to abandon their cars, with many commuters stranded due to public transport closures. Northern Powergrid reported that 23,000 properties were left without electricity in North-East England after flash flooding and lightning storms hit the area. The Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service reported more than 1,500 calls relating to flooding on the night of 28 June. 999 <b>land</b> <b>line</b> services were knocked out in some areas and the damage ran to huge amounts only visible the next day after water cleared. Many parts of County Durham and Northumberland were also affected with thousands of homes across the North East left without power due to lightning strikes. Lightning was filmed striking the Tyne Bridge as motorists were sat gridlocked on it.|$|E
25|$|The 53d WRS {{maintains}} similarly configured {{satellite communications}} ground stations within CARCAH at the NHC and its facility at Keesler to receive and process {{data from the}} aircraft. The Keesler ground station is maintained as a backup to the primary system at NHC, which has greater data streaming capability, and would be manned by CARCAH personnel {{in the event of}} a long-term satellite communications failure at NHC. During temporary outages, 53d personnel at Keesler act as operators and relay data from the aircraft by <b>land</b> <b>line</b> to the CARCAH ground station. Processed data is transmitted to the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS) of the Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, which then relays it to the NWS Telecommunication Gateway at Silver Spring, Maryland, for worldwide distribution. The Keesler site has direct communications capability with WPMDS in the event of land line/internet failure between Keesler and the NHC. The system also provides backup transmission paths to WPMDS using local NHC servers and satellite connection to Keesler in the event of internet outages, except if an outage originates at Offutt.|$|E

25|$|Richthofen {{moved his}} HQ to Ochamps {{to keep up}} with events, while he gambled on German air superiority holding out to fill forward airfields up with {{aircraft}} leading to overcrowding. He also had communication difficulties, and flew around in his Storch to organise air support for the army. Hugo Sperrle, chief of Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet Three) arrived at the same HQ, disrupting staff work and leading Richthofen to explode with rage. The pressures compelled him to risk being shot down in order to pass on orders, and while flying on 22 May he was forced to land owing to a fractured fuel tank. He organised support for Reinhardt and covered Heinz Guderian's Corps, with KG 77, StG 77 and JG 27. While he complained about communication, {{by the standards of the}} day, it was efficient. The radio-equipped forward liaison officers assigned Fliegerkorps VIII new targets, while leaving less important orders to <b>land</b> <b>line</b> officers. The Ju 87s were on 20-minute alert, and within 45 to 75 minutes they were diving onto their targets. In some cases, they were able to respond in 10 minutes. By 21 May, with his fighters based at Charleville-Mézières, Ju 87s at Sint-Truiden, and his Do 17s back in Germany, Richthofen's logistics were overstretched and his fuel was running out.|$|E

500|$|Bouck sent James, Slape and Creger {{to set up}} an {{observation}} post in a house on {{the eastern side of the}} village that had been abandoned by Task Force X. Accompanying them, he spotted in the dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 German troops headed toward them from the east. Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were Fallschirmjäger, among the best soldiers Germany could field. None of his training or experience prepared him for this situation, outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1. Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit. The platoon's telephone <b>land</b> <b>line</b> to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out, but their SCR-300 radio still worked.

500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need to idle their engines to {{maintain}} climate control within the truck cab (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. Engine idling is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to idle their engines. The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver to idle the engine. IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and <b>land</b> <b>line</b> phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants. Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running.|$|E
