25|$|The Cosmic Connection is a 150ft <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> {{connecting}} {{the main building}} and the underground exhibition areas (see below) that depicts {{the history of the}} universe, and dramatizes {{the amount of time that}} has passed from the Big Bang to the present day using, hundreds of individual pieces of astronomy-related jewelry.|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} technology progressed in {{the mid-19th}} century, trains grew {{in length and}} weight. Passenger cars grew along with them, first getting longer {{with the addition of}} a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored a single pair of doors at one end of the car in the car's vestibule; compartmentized cars on American railroads featured a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> with doors from the hall to the compartments.|$|E
25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room {{to the right of}} the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> to the left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase in the front hall, and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E

25|$|North Campus Hall - The largest {{dormitory}} on Trinity's {{campus was}} completed in 1958. The building has since been renovated various times, and spans the trajectory of two streets, from Vernon Street to Allen Place. It is a two-story building with <b>long</b> <b>hallways</b> and multiple common rooms.|$|R
25|$|Carnegie Mellon offers {{conventional}} housing for its students through single-gender, coeducational, and special interest options. Students {{can choose from}} a variety of housing options. The three options for first-year students are standard, prime, and apartment-style living. Standard is a typical college dormitory setting, a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> with a series of double (two people to a room). Prime offers more privacy through suite-style rooms. Apartment-style living is available through the Residence on Fifth and Shirley apartments. Upperclassmen have additional options for housing which include town houses and a larger variety of one or two bedroom apartments. There are 20 residential buildings on campus and five off campus in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh.|$|E
500|$|Guests {{are then}} ushered into the {{building}} and into the retro-modern exhibit. The 1960s narration, however, is cut short by a MIB agent terminating the false program and issuing the [...] "recruits" [...] into Men in Black Headquarters. One of {{the walls of the}} exhibit splits, opening up into an elevator, which travels deep into the Earth. Guests who have an Express Pass and use it for this ride takes another entrance which, instead of riding the elevator, walk up a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> and meets the guests with no Express Passes after they have walked through the hallway. Single riders follow a third queue.|$|E
500|$|While critics {{generally}} praised Square Enix's {{attempt to}} revitalize the Final Fantasy series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon, an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns, free-roaming capabilities, and interaction with non-player characters. GamePro described the gameplay as [...] "a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both," [...] and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's [...] "biggest shortcoming", and felt the first section was [...] "superficial." [...] Edge and others awarded the game especially lower scores {{as a result of}} these aspects, with Edge in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.|$|E
50|$|The main {{college is}} located at 58 Fernberg Road and was built in 1949 (architect: Frank L. Cullen). The college {{building}} is a three storey brick construction, containing 9 classrooms and an attached under croft recreational area. The classrooms are accessed by an internal wooden staircase and <b>long</b> <b>hallways.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Maps' design can {{significantly}} impact the gameplay. [...] For example, the gameplay may be shifted towards a platformer (by careful placement of platforms) or a puzzle game (by {{extensive use of}} buttons, keys, and doors). Some FPS maps may be designed to prevent sniping by not including any <b>long</b> <b>hallways,</b> while other maps may allow for a mix of sniping and closer combat.|$|R
5000|$|This {{had led to}} {{what some}} {{consider}} a bizarre 'maze' like layout, where separate store rooms containing music related equipment are connected via <b>long</b> <b>hallways,</b> sharp turns, un-level floors, et cetera."...'30 years of Cool' have taken a toll on the three-story stone building that once was the Irondequoit Grange Hall. The floors creak loudly under trampled carpeting, and so many bands have signed the walls that the messages are nearly illegible." ...|$|R
500|$|Bobby {{explains}} {{that the man who}} attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he was unable to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay awake for two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure it any longer, Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside on a blanket with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a <b>long</b> <b>hallway.</b> He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own worst nightmare. The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{incredible}} camera setup. We rehearsed two days. The camera followed Greenstreet and Bogart from one room into another, then down a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> and finally into a living room; there the camera moved {{up and down in}} what is referred to as a boom-up and boom-down shot, then panned from left to right and back to Bogart's drunken face; the next pan shot was to Greenstreet's massive stomach from Bogart's point of view. ... One miss and we had to begin all over again.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, let us {{examine a}} {{situation}} which would exhibit memorylessness. Imagine a <b>long</b> <b>hallway,</b> lined {{on one wall}} with thousands of safes. Each safe has a dial with 500 positions, and each has been assigned an opening position at random. Imagine that an eccentric man walks down the hallway, stopping once at each safe to make a single random attempt to open it. In this case, we might define random variable X as the lifetime of his search, {{expressed in terms of}} [...] "number of attempts the man must make until he successfully opens a safe". In this case, E will always be equal to the value of 500, regardless of how many attempts have already been made. Each new attempt has a (1/500) chance of succeeding, so the man is likely to open exactly one safe sometime in the next 500 attempts -- but with each new failure he makes no [...] "progress" [...] toward ultimately succeeding. Even if the man has just failed 499 consecutive times (or 4,999 times), we expect to wait 500 more attempts until we observe the next success. If, instead, this man focused his attempts on a single safe, and [...] "remembered" [...] his previous attempts to open it, he would be guaranteed to open the safe after, at most, 500 attempts (and, in fact, at onset would only expect to need 250 attempts, not 500).|$|E

25|$|Barrel vaults {{are known}} from Ancient Egypt, and were used {{extensively}} in Roman architecture. They {{were also used}} to replace the Cloaca Maxima with a system of underground sewers. Other early barrel vault designs occur in northern Europe, Turkey, Morocco, and other regions. In medieval Europe, the barrel vault was {{an important element of}} stone construction in monasteries, castles, tower houses and other structures. This form of design is observed in cellars, crypts, <b>long</b> <b>hallways,</b> cloisters and even great halls.|$|R
50|$|A gallery is a {{passageway}} {{running along}} the wall of an enclosure or along the axis of a temple, often open to one or both sides. Historically, {{the form of the}} gallery evolved during the 10th century from the increasingly <b>long</b> <b>hallways</b> which had earlier been used to surround the central sanctuary of a temple. During the period of Angkor Wat {{in the first half of}} the 12th century, additional half galleries on one side were introduced to buttress the structure of the temple.|$|R
2500|$|The walls on {{both the}} {{northern}} and southern sides of the lobby each contain storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level. At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna). The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect, contains an embossing of the building's outline [...] "with the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind it and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building". In the background is a state map of New York, with the building's location marked by a [...] "medallion" [...] in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right, and a plaque to the tower's major developers is on the bottom left. At this point, the lobby feeds into a one-story tall, similarly-designed rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators. The rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on {{the northern and southern}} sides of the rectangle, as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> on the western side. At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is one bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors. The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from both the northern and southern corridors, respectively, at approximately the two-thirds point of each corridor.|$|E
60|$|After {{that came}} another period of silence, {{broken only by}} the sounds of the two men undressing. To keep himself awake Dick {{commenced}} to walk up and down the <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> again.|$|E

5000|$|Medbery Hall is an {{original}} Hobart College dorm {{dating from the}} 1900. Medbery defines {{the right side of}} the Hobart Quadrangle. Designed by Clinton and Russell architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarity in their Jacobean Gothic style. Medbery is adorned with a recognizable Flemish roofline. Medbery was designed without <b>long</b> <b>hallways</b> [...] "conductive to rioting" [...] and mischief, such as rolling a cannonball down the hallway. Such mischief was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Paul Thomas Anderson. It was shot with the crew (and certain members of the cast) of Boogie Nights while the film was in its editing process. The entire music video is filmed in an over three minute long take (a technique Anderson frequently uses in his films) in downtown Los Angeles in the <b>longest</b> <b>hallway</b> in North America at {{over a quarter of}} a mile long. The video features Penn walking briskly down the narrow hallway through various themed areas, such as a dance marathon referencing They Shoot Horses, Don't They?.|$|R
5000|$|The bathhouse {{had large}} women's and men's public saunas, {{accessible}} from the lobby area, and smaller private saunas, accessible from labyrinth-style <b>long</b> <b>hallways.</b> There {{was also a}} large private sauna - sauna No. 21 -, known as [...] "family sauna". Every morning c. 6 am, natural gas fires were lit on burners located along the hallways, on the walls, close to the floor level. Each burner threw a powerful flame into a pipeline, approximately three inch thick by diameter, which led underneath the hot rocks of a sauna. This design and method used for the heating of the saunas was unique.|$|R
6000|$|... "To the {{laughing}} chamber," [...] replied Scollops; and having {{reached the top}} of the stairs, they walked down a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> and entered a room so odd and pretty that Tot stopped short and gazed at it in astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{rose with}} {{elaborate}} boarding-house apologies {{to the room}} at large for going, and a cheerful but not intimate [...] "Good night" [...] to Istra, she {{followed him to the}} door and into the dark <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> without.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} pitch dark, only a dim lamp being lighted {{in the rear}} of the <b>long</b> <b>hallway.</b> Jack stepped forward to get a match from a bureau, and as he did so he {{stumbled}} over something on the floor and pitched headlong.|$|E
50|$|When the San Remo was {{originally}} designed, {{it had a}} wide range of relatively luxurious apartment configurations. The apartments were accessed from opulent twin lobbies which contained terrazzo floors, marble walls and custom light fixtures of bronze and frosted glass. The building has two addresses, 145 and 146 Central Park West, because the building was designed so that each half of the structure is served by separate lobbies, eliminating the need for <b>long</b> <b>hallways</b> across the main floor. There are still some doctor's offices on the first floor, but several of the professional/commercial spaces have recently been sold to tenants who reside in the building for use as office space.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} memorable for its campus style {{construction}} consisting eventually of thirteen separate buildings, including an auditorium added in 1977. The classroom buildings were <b>long</b> <b>hallways,</b> which connected {{five or six}} individual rooms. Michigan winters were not amenable to the open campus and the constant walks outside from building to building. In addition, the student population continued to grow, and the buildings began to quickly deteriorate.In 1986, Central High was completely rebuilt {{with the exception of}} the auditorium, the gymnasium, the cafeteria, and the art/industrial arts wing, all of which were incorporated into one new building. Since that time, the school has undergone numerous building and remodeling projects.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of dungeons: [...] "shuffle dungeons", which consist of irregularly shaped areas, and [...] "random dungeons", which consist of square areas {{connected}} through <b>long</b> <b>hallways.</b> Each time the player enters a dungeon, its layout and the locations of items and monsters within it change. The dungeons include traps, which the player can uncover by using their sword. The game is turn-based, with enemies taking one turn every time the player performs an action, such as walking one step or attacking. In order to damage an enemy, the player needs to be close to them; the player can move diagonally to get closer to the enemy in fewer turns.|$|R
60|$|So speaking, the {{unreasonable}} teacher caught hold of Sam once more, {{and despite}} the youngest Rover's struggles hustled {{him out of the}} office and through a <b>long</b> <b>hallway,</b> {{at the end of which}} was located the storeroom he had mentioned. The key to the room was in the lock.|$|E
60|$|Presently Lenore was summoned. When {{she left}} her room {{she was in the}} throes of {{uncontrolled}} agitation, and all down the <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> she fought herself. At the half-open door she paused to lean against the wall. There she had the will to still her nerves, to acquire serenity; and she prayed for wisdom to make her presence and her words of infinite good to Dorn in this crisis.|$|E
6000|$|There was a <b>long</b> <b>hallway</b> (or [...] "passageway," [...] as {{they call}} it {{in the land of the}} Colonels) with one side latticed, running along the rear of the house. The grocer's young man went through this to deliver his goods. One morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes, sallow complexion, and wide, smiling mouth, wearing a maid's cap and apron. But as he was cumbered with a basket of Early Drumhead lettuce and Trophy {{tomatoes}} and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive Queen olives, he saw no more than that she was one of the maids.|$|E
50|$|The {{tobacco factory}} {{consists}} of three segments, which are North, South and East. The building has characteristics of <b>long</b> open <b>hallways</b> with no dividing walls. The first floor mainly comprises columns to support {{the weight of the}} machines on the second floor.|$|R
25|$|The {{centre of}} the Shishin-den is {{surrounded}} by a hisashi (庇), a <b>long,</b> thin <b>hallway</b> which surrounded the main wing of an aristocrat's home, in traditional Heian architecture. Within this is a wide open space, crossed by boarded-over sections, leading to the central throne room.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} building, {{built in}} 1999, has been expanded. It {{consists of a}} central rotunda, where the cafeteria, offices, and library are located. Attached to this are two <b>long</b> <b>hallways</b> running in opposite directions, which house classrooms. At {{the end of one}} of the hallways are the athletic facilities, including a natatorium, workout facility, gymnasiums, fields, and a stadium. At the end of the other hallway, on {{the opposite end of the}} school, are the fine arts rehearsal facilities, black box theatre, and the freshman center. The original facility was built on a 66 acre site by PBK Architects to support a maximum of 2,800 students. The school has a net building area of 433000 sq ft. and cost of $37,507,000.|$|R
