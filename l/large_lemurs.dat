[...] The fossa is the largest member of Madagascar mongooses. They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small lemurs and tenrecs. Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (<b>larger</b> <b>lemurs)</b> has recently gone extinct. <b>Larger</b> <b>lemurs</b> (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500-1500 years ago.

The extinction of the <b>largest</b> <b>lemurs</b> is often attributed to predation by humans and possibly habitat destruction. Since all extinct lemurs were not only large (and thus ideal prey species), but also slow-moving (and thus more vulnerable to human predation), their presumably slow-reproducing and low-density populations were least likely to survive the introduction of humans. Gradual changes in climate have also been blamed, and may have played a minor role; however since the <b>largest</b> <b>lemurs</b> also survived the climatic changes from previous ice ages and only disappeared following the arrival of humans, it is unlikely that climatic change was largely responsible.|$|R

40|$|A remote eolianite {{cave and}} {{sinkhole}} complex on the southeast coast of Madagascar {{has played a}} major role in the history of paleontology in Madagascar. Andrahomana Cave has yielded a rich fossil record of the extinct megafauna. Expeditions in 2000 and 2003 produced a wealth of new material and provided the first systematic information concerning the genesis, stratigraphy, and taphonomy of the site. Recovered bones of one of the most poorly understood extinct <b>large</b> <b>lemurs,</b> Hadropithecus stenognathus, include many skeletal elements previously unknown. Radiocarbon dates show that the site has sampled this disappeared fauna in the midto- late Holocene, but that bone-bearing layers are stratigraphically mixed, probably owing to the effects of reworking of the sediments by extreme marine events. The diverse biota recovered contains elements of both eastern rain forest and southwestern arid bushland, reflecting the cave’s position in the zone of transition between wet and dry biomes. Bones of two unusual small mammals add to the previously long faunal list for the site: 1) the first fossil evidence for Macrotarsomys petteri, a large-bodied endemic nesomyid rodent previously known only from a single modern specimen; and 2) the type specimen and additional material of a newly described extinct shrew-tenrec (Microgale macpheei). Evidence for prehistoric and colonial-era humans includes artifacts, hearth deposits, and remains of human domesticates and other introduced species. Although previously protected by its extreme isolation, the unique site is vulnerable to exploitation. An incipient tourist industry is likely to bring more people to the cave, and there is currently no form of protection afforded to the site...|$|E
50|$|In the Ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), nests {{are made}} from locally {{collected}} material and may also be lined with hair plucked from their own body. In <b>larger</b> <b>lemur</b> species such as the Verreaux's sifaka, ring-tailed lemur and common brown lemur, the young cling to the mother and nests are not built.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} diademed sifaka, the indri is the <b>largest</b> <b>lemur</b> still in existence. It has a head-body length of 64 - 72 cm and can reach nearly 120 cm with legs fully extended. It can weigh between 6 and 9.5 kg, though {{the average is}} on {{the lower end of}} the range.|$|R
50|$|Giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea): The {{fossil record}} of Madagascar has yielded {{the remains of}} a {{recently}} extinct fossa which was about a quarter larger than the living species, making it close to the size of an ocelot. This species was believed to have preyed upon the <b>larger</b> <b>lemurs</b> that inhabited Madagascar until the island was settled by man.|$|R
40|$|A {{database}} {{has been}} assembled with 278 age determinations for Madagascar. Materials 14 C dated include pretreated sediments and plant macrofossils from cores and excavations throughout the island, and bones, teeth, or eggshells {{of most of}} the extinct megafaunal taxa, including the giant lemurs, hippopotami, and ratites. Additional measurements come from uranium-series dates on speleothems and thermoluminescence dating of pottery. Changes documented include late Pleistocene climatic events and, in the late Holocene, the apparently human-caused transformation of the environment. Multiple lines of evidence point to the earliest human presence at ca. 2300 14 C yr BP (350 cal yr BC). A decline in megafauna, inferred from a drastic decrease in spores of the coprophilous fungus Sporormiella spp. in sediments at 1720 ± 40 14 C yr BP (230 – 410 cal yr AD), is followed by large increases in charcoal particles in sediment cores, beginning in the SW part of the island, and spreading to other coasts and the interior over the next millennium. The record of human occupation is initially sparse, but shows large human populations throughout the island {{by the beginning of the}} Second Millennium AD. Dating of the “subfossil” megafauna, including pygmy hippos, elephant birds, giant tortoises, and <b>large</b> <b>lemurs,</b> demonstrates that most if not all the extinct taxa were still present on the island when humans arrived. Many taxa overlapped chronologically with humans for a millennium or more. The extinct lemurs Hadropithecus stenognathus, Pachylemur insignis, Mesopropithecus pithecoides, and Daubentonia robusta, and the elephant birds Aepyornis spp. and Mullerornis spp., were still present near the end of the First Millennium AD. Palaeopropithecus ingens, Megaladapis edwardsi, and Archaeolemur sp. (cf. edwardsi) may have survived until the middle of the Second Millennium A. D. One specimen of Hippopotamus of unknown provenance dates to the period of European colonization...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the felids, there is a <b>large</b> <b>lemur</b> population in the park. Many lemur species are represented, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), the red ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata rubra), the crowned lemur (Eulemur coronatus), and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Many of the lemurs roam freely about the park, and occasionally interact with visitors.|$|R
50|$|The park holds over 165 {{species of}} exotic animals, among other attractions {{such as a}} small theme park. The park {{contains}} the largest groups of white lions, cheetahs, hippopotami, and meerkats in the UK, {{as well as the}} <b>largest</b> <b>lemur</b> walk-through exhibit. It was also the first park in the UK to have the African big five game animals.|$|R
5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The <b>largest</b> captive <b>lemur</b> population {{can be found at}} the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another <b>large</b> <b>lemur</b> colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|R
50|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is a {{relatively}} <b>large</b> <b>lemur.</b> Its average weight is 2.2 kg. Its head-body length ranges between 39 and 46 cm, its tail length is 56 and 63 cm, and its total length is 95 and 110 cm.

500|$|The {{biological}} rhythm {{can vary from}} nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most <b>larger</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Diurnality is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine. Cathemerality, where an animal is active sporadically both day and night, occurs {{among some of the}} <b>larger</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle, either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions. The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs. Although the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz) is the best-documented example, every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior, although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity. This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other Lemuridae species, such as ruffed lemurs and bamboo lemurs. Initially described as [...] "crepuscular" [...] (active at dawn and dusk), anthropologist Ian Tattersall stimulated additional research and coined the new term [...] "cathemeral", although many non-anthropologists prefer the terms [...] "circadian" [...] or [...] "diel".|$|R

50|$|For a <b>large</b> <b>lemur,</b> the diademed sifaka {{is rather}} athletic, being capable of lateral aerial {{propulsion}} {{of up to}} 30 kilometers per hour, a result of muscular leg thrusting action pushing off from a vertical tree trunk. It is possible, although not proven, that its vigorous health characteristics are enhanced from high consumption of two plants which contain high concentrations of alkaloids. This species is arboreal, and only rarely are seen on the ground; moreover, it is a vertical clinger and lateral leaper.|$|R
5000|$|Madagascar {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the African landmass for approximately 165 million years and its flora and fauna evolved in isolation from that time onwards. The island {{is one of the}} world's most biologically diverse areas, and is internationally renowned as a wildlife tourism and ecotourism destination, focusing on lemurs, birds, and orchids. [...] More than half of the island's breeding birds are endemic. Other native species include the red-bellied lemur, the aye-aye, and the indri (the <b>largest</b> <b>lemur</b> species).|$|R
5|$|Many of the <b>larger</b> <b>lemur</b> species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids.

5|$|Lemurs {{time their}} mating and birth seasons {{so that all}} weaning periods are {{synchronized}} to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas <b>larger</b> <b>lemurs,</b> such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' sifaka, {{has been shown to}} be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother.
