5000|$|<b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> are {{sedimentary}} rock formations which {{formed in the}} bottom of ancient lakes. [...] A common characteristic of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> is that a river or stream channel has carried sediment into the basin. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> form in all lake types including rift graben lakes, oxbow lakes, glacial lakes, and crater lakes. Lacustrine environments, like seas, are large bodies of water. They share similar sedimentary deposits which are mainly composed of low-energy particle sizes. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> are typically very well sorted with highly laminated beds of silts, clays, and occasionally carbonates. [...] In regards to geologic time, lakes are temporary and once they no longer receive water, they dry up and leave a formation.|$|R
40|$|On {{both sides}} of the Jinsha River valley near Benzilan, Deqen, {{northwest}} of Yunnan, China, a series of varied <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> have been discovered under the fourth terrace (Q(3) (2)). Landslide debris has been identified underlying the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits,</b> indicating that the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> were caused by a landslide damming the Jinsha River. U-series dating shows that the age of the upper and middle portions of the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> on the right bank were 55. 4 +/- 3. 5 and 82. 1 +/- 6. 6 ka respectively. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> on the left bank have been dated to 122. 0 +/- 12. 4 ka at the bottom, which indicates that the large-scale landslide was formed before 122. 0 +/- 12. 4 ka and the paleo-lake was developed within the early stage to the mid-stage of the Late Pleistocene. The characteristic of spore-pollen and high content of CaCO(3) in the lacustrine clays reveal that the paleoclimate was semi-arid with less heavy rainfall. Considering the regional neotectonic background, the authors prefer to interpret that the Benzilan ancient landslide-dammed lake was caused by an ancient earthquake. The discovery of the ancient landslide-dammed lake provides significance {{to the understanding of the}} formation and evolvement of calamitous geological hazards along large rivers.

Contrary to some erroneous {{reports in}} the popular press, {{it is not the}} world's oldest horseshoe crab (Order Xiphosurida), but is scientifically instead the oldest paleolimulid (Family Paleolimulidae). It is known from two examples found by visitors - including a Grade 4 student. The species name honors Sonja Wood who runs the Blue Beach Museum and has studied the fossils for many years along with her husband Chris Mansky. Trilobites are also rarely found. This is interesting because trilobites are marine, whereas the majority of the Blue Beach location is seen as a <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit.</b> The trilobites found thus far are restricted to a 20 cm thick layer.|$|E
50|$|Lacustrine {{deposits}} {{can form}} in every variety of basins found in nature. How each basin originates {{is where the}} distinction between <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> types stem. Rift graben lakes are formed from crustal stretching also known as rifting. Sediment influx is typically dominated by precipitation runoff and discharge through channels migrating towards the depression. Oxbow lakes form lacustrine deposits from seasonal overbank flooding as well as precipitation runoff which refills these isolated basins with fresh water and new sediments. Glacial lakes form when terminal moraines block water from escaping the newly carved valley from glacial erosion. As the glacier melts, the valley fills with melt water that creates a glacial lake. Crater lakes can be meteoritic or of the caldera variety. Crater lakes sediments are provided from precipitation runoff descending their steep slopes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> {{have gained}} more {{attention}} recently due to containing valuable source rocks of oil, coal, and uranium. <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> generally provide productive mining conditions but can prove challenging when underground mines are attempted {{due to the}} poor shear strength of clays and silts {{as well as the}} amount of moisture often locked in the layers due to a low permeability characteristic of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits.</b> Ephemeral lakes have recently been found to be especially valuable due to their seasonal wetting and drying out characteristic. Between the wet and the dry seasons, there is a time period when organic matter has the perfect opportunity to generate, only to be submerged by the influx of water during the wet season. This action creates a prime combination of organic matter, silts and clays to create oil shales or coal deposits.|$|R

30|$|Figure  29 (c) {{shows the}} failure pattern at Purano Naikap area. The similar pattern may be widely {{distributed}} around the Kathmandu basin. In {{this kind of}} area, {{the structure of the}} <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> overlaying the bedrock can form an enhanced structure for the occurrence of landslides. If there is no earthquake, the gentle slopes are good for agriculture and housing. However, during a large earthquake, existing landslides can be reactivated. Because the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> landslide mainly consists of clay, generally they will not move for long distance during earthquake, but they can amplify the vibration and cause general destruction to the buildings, especially if the buildings in this area were located on shallow foundations on cut-slopes at the upper side, and infilled ground at the lower side. The amplified shaking may cause intensive settlement at the infill and cause non-homogeneous deformation at the foundation. When a building is located at the boundary of a landslide, it will suffer much more severe damage.|$|E
30|$|Through {{the field}} investigation, {{it was found}} that {{geological}} and geomorphological characteristics of a site, combined with the structure feature of the building, such as the short column effect, amplified the seismic vibration and caused severe building collapse and damages, i.e., 1) For buildings on flat area consisting of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> or diluvial deposit, resonance effect might be the main reason, while for the buildings on the top of hills or narrow ridges, topographic effect and sometimes, short column effect should take the main responsibility; 2) For buildings located on the gentle slopes or landslides, the settlement in the infill side caused by the strong seismic vibration can be the main reason; 3) Besides of the building failure on <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit,</b> failure patterns in three types of topographic and geological features, i.e., narrow ridges formed by landslides, diluvial deposits and alluvial fans, and landslides, were proposed as the possible mechanism of the building damage caused by the earthquake.

Minor <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> are also occurring. The Trujillo Sandstone, channel-deposits, and Cooper Canyon Formation, overbank deposits with minor channel and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits,</b> are separated from the Santa Rosa-Tecovas by an unconformity.

40|$|A 2 m thick {{laminated}} <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> of silt {{and clay}} {{recovered from the}} high-latitudinal site at Sokli (northern Finland) provides a unique mid-Weichselian fossil record for Fennoscandia. High-resolution botanical and zoological analyses of the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> allow detailed reconstruction of the regional vegetational development and {{of the history of}} the lake and the wetland ecosystem within the Sokli basin during the early part of the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial (= equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3). The inferred terrestrial vegetation represented by the Sokli MIS 3 sequence (so-called Tulppio Interstadial) was probably low-arctic tundra, treeless but with shrub elements including juniper, willow, dwarf birch, ericoids, lycopods and a rich herb flora with a variety of arctic-alpine taxa and heliophilous, pioneer elements. The presence of herbs such as Rubus chamaemorus, Epilobium palustre, Potentilla palustris and Sphagnum, Drepanocladus and other mosses suggests that the lake was fringed by wet meadows and peatlands or peaty telmatic communities. The distributional ranges of pine and tree birch were probably only a few hundred kilometres south or southeast of Sokli. This is concordant with evidence for the presence of boreal tree taxa during the MIS 3 in the Baltic countries and further east in Europe, but contradicts with the commonly inferred treeless tundra or grass-dominated steppe conditions in central Europe. © 2008 The Authors, Journal compilation © 2008 The Boreas Collegium...|$|E

40|$|A new {{vertebrate}} assemblage {{was discovered}} in an Early  Miocene <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> {{near the village of}} Laerru (northern Sardinia, Italy). The assemblage is composed by mammals, reptiles and a bird. The mammals are represented by three ruminants (cf.

The assemblage can be related to the “Oschiri fauna”, one of the oldest endemic insular fauna known in the Mediterranean. The age of the Laerru vertebrates is early-middle Burdigalian, between 18. 8 and 18. 3 Ma, corresponding to the mammal unit of the main land MN 3.

40|$|Quaternary {{lacustrine}} sedimentation of the San Lorenzo Succession {{represents one}} of the more recent steps {{in the evolution of the}} northern part of the Sant'Arcangelo Basin. The latter is a large Pliocene to Pleistocene wedge-top depozone of the southern Apennines foreland-basin system that developed close to the front of the thrust belt in southern Italy. The lower to middle Pleistocene <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> are composed of siltstone and claystone interbedded with sandstone, carbonate and volcaniclastic beds, arranged in fining-upward sequences. The overall stratigraphical, sedimentological, and structural data collected demonstrate that the San Lorenzo <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> formed when the northern sector of the Sant'Arcangelo Basin was undergoing tectonic deformation. In particular, new data reveal the presence of strike-slip syndepositional faults. These faults belong to positive flower-type structures, which developed in a left-lateral transpressive tectonic regime characterized by a E-W horizontal component of shear stress. The <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposits</b> recorded the activity of these faults showing growth structures represented mainly by gentle synclines, as well as other minor folds.

Palaeotemperature estimates calculated from the fossil chironomid-assemblages of the Early Glacial <b>lacustrine</b> <b>deposit</b> indicate mean July air temperatures of ca. 15 °C, which {{is in line with}} results derived in earlier studies from the Niederlausitz area and from northwestern Europe. The Early Pleniglacial lacustrine deposits consist of an organic-rich gyttja, intercalated with sand and silt lenses. The chironomid-assemblages show that a shallow meso- to eutrophic lake was present at the study site, and chironomid-inferred palaeotemperature estimates indicate an abrupt decline in July air temperatures from 15 - 16 °C to ca. 13 °C.
