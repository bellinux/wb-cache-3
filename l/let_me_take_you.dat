5|$|Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical film {{depicting}} {{the murder of}} John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was {{written and directed by}} Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche.|$|E
25|$|Following the murder, and for {{the first}} six years in Attica, Chapman refused all {{requests}} for interviews. James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. Chapman later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Democrat and Chronicle. In 1992 Jones published a book, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon.|$|E
500|$|The real Mark David Chapman is {{currently}} incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, {{he has not}} spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title [...] "Chapter 27" [...] suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, {{to the point of}} attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.|$|E

[...] I ask for dearest life alone, [...] That I may live to love her.|$|R

500|$|An African hip hop and hip hop song, {{the track}} {{was written by}} the two musicians while {{production}} was handled by disc jockey CedSolo. The recording lyrically finds Sarkodie discussing that he's the [...] "new guy" [...] in the music industry. [...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's up to me to make sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E

2500|$|The Animals {{performed}} fiery {{versions of}} the staple rhythm and blues repertoire, covering songs by Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, Nina Simone, and others.

6000|$|... "I {{recollect}} her," [...] {{answered the}} Minor Poet, [...] "a somewhat depressing lady. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> another case. <b>You</b> possess a remarkably pretty housemaid--Edith, if I have it rightly." ...|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE. I shall go to her. 'Miss Phoebe,' I will say--oh, ma'am, so reverently--'Miss Phoebe, my beautiful, most estimable of women, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>you</b> {{for ever}} more.' ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> back to {{the winter}} of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place {{of work in the}} City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E

60|$|VALENTINE. But you {{ceased to}} care for me. (Tenderly.) I dare ask your love no more, but I still ask you to put {{yourself}} into my keeping. Miss Phoebe, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} been nursing me all the time! Papa, <b>you</b> must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>you</b> now. Do pray {{go to bed at}} once, and get up late. Nurse will take good care of me. Good-night, dear papa." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Avast, my hearty, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> {{soundings}} before <b>you</b> dive,' laughed Emil, understanding her affectionate caresses, {{and holding}} her off {{with one hand}} while with the other he rummaged out sundry foreign little boxes and parcels marked with different names, and handed them round with appropriate remarks, which caused much laughter; for Emil was a wag.|$|R
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{on to the}} day of the assault. My {{cousin and}} I were {{separated}} at the outset. I never saw him when we forded the river; when we planted the English flag in the first breach; when we crossed the ditch beyond; and, fighting every inch of our way, entered the town. It was only at dusk, when the place was ours, and after General Baird himself had found the dead body of Tippoo under a heap of the slain, that Herncastle and I met.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!

60|$|BRODIE. We shall see. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to your room. Come. And, remember, it is {{for your}} brother's sake. It is to save me.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is plenty}} of wrong without that, Jock. While you never heed {{anything}} but fun and amusement I do not see how you are to come to anything worth having; and you will soon get betrayed into something unworthy. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> away in disgrace, my boy; it would break my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am--and yet I am very happy. I don't {{suppose you}} men can understand, {{but a woman}} wants to marry the man she loves--and yet she is sad at leaving girlhood behind. Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> two lumps, don't you? I must not forget that. It makes the waiter stare when a wife can't {{remember}} how many lumps of sugar her husband takes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Musically, [...] "Sexercize" [...] is a dubstep {{influence}} {{song that}} incorporates elements of R&B and electronic dance music. Ryan Lathan from PopMatters said that, while {{as a negative}} response; [...] "The quivering electro-harp intro {{turns out to be}} one of the biggest come hither teases of the entire album, giving off the impression that some torrid, naughty storm is brewing ahead. It rolls right over. The chorus is negligible, the gauche 'Let's Get Physical' double entendres are eye-rollingly unsexy, and Minogue's delivery is too ladylike to deliver lines like, 'Feel the burn... <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it down. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it up. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce... stretch it out baby.'" [...] Kitty Empire from The Observer said that, lyrically; [...] "It's so raunchy, it could just be an in-joke cooked up between Kylie and Sia Furler (who wrote the song, and exec-produced KMO). Lyrics such as 'feel the burn' suggest an STD, not ecstasy." [...] Andy Gill from The Independent believed that [...] "Sexercize" [...] was an attempt to enter the American market with the contemporary use of dubstep.|$|R
