25|$|Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as {{with the}} Senate Majority Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and {{prominence}} vary depending upon the style {{and power of the}} Speaker of the House. Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor.

25|$|In the post-Suharto period since 1998, {{civilian}} and military <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> successfully removing the military influence from politics and advocated the structural reform in military body. For example, the military's representation in the House of Representatives was removed, the police forces was separated completely from armed force, and an active military officer can only serve his/her commission within the armed forces itself and thus is prohibited from being appointed to government positions (including as Minister of Defense). It sometimes comes to armed conflicts {{between the military and}} the police.|$|E
25|$|Badges {{with both}} <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{recently}} used by people traveling between regions as an item for bartering in the North Korean grey market. Previously, methamphetamine {{was used for}} bartering before various crackdowns made the practice hard. Badges eventually replaced drugs despite falling prices. In Pyongyang, too, where money and prized items are in short supply, the badges have value. This makes them a target for pickpockets. Criminals, who are often wealthier than ordinary North Koreans, usually choose to wear the expensive types of badges as status symbols.|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, the {{position}} of Government House Leader was not technically a cabinet-level post, but rather a parliamentary office, so to qualify for cabinet membership, an individual had to be named to cabinet in some other capacity. For a time, with {{the position}} having evolved into a full-time job, Government House <b>Leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named to cabinet as Ministers of State with no portfolio specified. The Martin government created these positions so that the Minister of State title is effectively invisible. An amendment to the Salaries Act made this unnecessary by listing the Government House Leader as a minister.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Moldova and Russia deteriorated in November 2003 over a Russian {{proposal for the}} solution of the Transnistrian conflict, which Moldovan authorities refused to accept because it stipulated a 20-year Russian military presence in Moldova. The federalization plan for Moldova would have also turned Transnistria and Gagauzia into a blocking minority over all major policy matters of Moldova. As of 2006, approximately 1,200 of the 14th Army personnel remain stationed in Transnistria, guarding a large ammunitions depot at Colbasna. In recent years, negotiations between the Transnistrian and Moldovan <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> going on under the mediation of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia, and Ukraine; lately observers from the European Union and the United States have become involved, creating a 5+2 format.|$|E

25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants.

Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during the week before the rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad <b>Leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cut from the band in past years.

25|$|More {{and more}} Afghan tribal <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{requesting}} additional ADTs, which illustrates {{how important the}} use of public diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province {{is one of the most}} stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support, and logistics.
