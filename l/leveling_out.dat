5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before <b>leveling</b> <b>out</b> as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E

25|$|Hurricane Earl's outflow {{steadily}} improved through August30 {{and sustained}} winds rose above 100mph (155km/h), making Earl a Category2 storm. Around 1200UTC, {{the center of}} Earl passed roughly 25mi (35km) east-northeast of St. Martin with sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours later, the storm further intensified into a major hurricane. That afternoon, Earl became a Category4 hurricane, attaining winds of 135mph (215km/h) before <b>leveling</b> <b>out</b> in intensity. A northwestard track began to become apparent by {{this time as the}} system neared the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic Ocean. Early on August31, an eyewall replacement cycle, a process in which a storm's eye dissipates and is replaced by a larger one, began to take place. Despite increasing wind shear, the system maintained its intensity through September1, when it briefly weakened to a Category3 system. Gradual strengthening took place throughout the day as the eye became better defined and convection deepened around the center. Additionally, the storm began to turn northward in response to the ridge over the Atlantic and a strong trough over the Great Lakes. Hurricane Earl later attained its peak intensity during the morning of September2 with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a barometric pressure of 928mbar (hPa; 27.40inHg).|$|E

40|$|It was {{recognized}} {{that a large}} area in Hashtgerd plain, {{in the vicinity of}} Tehran, is subject to the land subsidence. GPS continuous measurements and precise <b>leveling</b> surveys carried <b>out</b> by National Cartographic Center of Iran (NCC) recognized the land subsidence occurrence in Hashtgerd. To map the extent and pattern of the subsidence in southwest of Tehran, the Interferometric SAR (InSAR) method was used. The subsidence contains one main lobe which agrees very well with the cultivated lands. Two interferograms were processed using 4 ENVISAT ASAR raw images obtained from track 149. One interferogram spanning the summer season in which the groundwater is over-extracted contains the subsidence signal up to 7 cm within 35 days. The other interferogram due to the winter recovery season contains strong uplift effects. It {{was recognized}} that the piezometers information is not in agreements with pumping wells depths. It was assumed that another aquifer system may exist in Hashtgerd area. InSARderived subsidence pattern significantly fits the aquifer system hypothetical boundary.

500|$|In {{stand alone}} PV systems {{batteries}} are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid-connected photovoltaic power system, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [...] Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are {{a small fraction of the}} grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by <b>leveling</b> <b>out</b> peak loads usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} often tumultuous relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and democracy. Nietzsche has always had an antipathy towards democracy. Nietzsche has claimed that democracy espouses a will to equality which levels the greatest men along with the most average men. For Nietzsche, his Ubermenschen must emerge from the muddle of mediocrity and similitude in order to set themselves apart from the herd. The herd is more than happy to live in a democratic society since no one will be rendered better or greater than anyone else. I argue that Nietzsche does not realize democracy 2 ̆ 7 s many assets. Liberal democracy could very well be the best political springboard for his Ubermenschen. For Nietzsche, higher culture emerges in spite of modernity 2 ̆ 7 s leveling snare. These great men engage in contests. They create their own rules and values. They say what they like. In a fascist society, these men would never be allowed to do as they please. One benefit of liberal democracy is that we are given the right to dissent. We are given the right to express ourselves. Democracy could facilitate the emergence of the elusive Ubermenschen. These are men who transcend the average and the ordinary. In this dissertation I begin by exploring Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s cultural criticisms. He devotes a great deal of energy condemning modernity and its <b>leveling</b> tendencies. <b>Out</b> of the cultural morass that is modernity comes this higher culture of which Nietzsche speaks highly. In chapter two, I argue that higher culture must begin with the individual. I will examine what it takes for a man to be able to transcend his mediocre culture. In chapter three, I examine the contemporary political climate and try to determine whether these great individuals could emerge in such a climate. Finally, in chapter four I examine which political system could best help this culture emerge. I argue that liberal democracy is the best environment for these higher men...|$|R
40|$|The Colli Albani {{volcanic}} complex (Rome, Italy) {{has been}} dominated by episodic eruptions commencing around 561 ka and ending with the most recent activity of the Albano maar phase (0 ka). Earthquakes of moderate intensity, gas emissions and significant ground deformations are the recent evidences of a residual activity. Former geodetic data from leveling surveys, GPS stations and InSAR observations tracked ongoing significant uplift of the order of few mm/year near the Colli Albani western flank. Different uplift rates were detected by each technique in different time spans, suggesting also the possibility of sporadic recharge of the hydrothermal system.

40|$|Over {{the last}} century the Ravenna area has been {{affected}} by a widespread land subsidence process of both natural and anthropogenic origin {{which has become a}} matter of increasingly great concern. Land settlement, initially of the order of a few mm/year, dramatically increased up to 110 mm/year after World War II primarily due to groundwater pumping and, subordinately, gas production from a number of deep on-shore and off-shore reservoirs. Spirit <b>leveling</b> was carried <b>out</b> {{in the area of the}} Ravenna Municipality by various authorities and agencies ever since the end of the nineteenth century using an increasingly refined network of benchmarks. The available information, spanning the time interval from 1897 to 2002, has been implemented and homogenized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Measurements processed by kriging provide the pattern of the subsidence rates over the municipal territory during eight sub-periods. The reliability of data processing is discussed for both magnitude and areal distribution of the occurrence, showing a pronounced nonlinear behavior in time, as related to the major responsible factors. Cumulative land subsidence approaches almost 1 m over more than one third of the municipality area including the city and a significant fraction of the coastland, with peaks larger than 1. 5 m over a 10 km 2 zone located between the historical center and the coastline. Most recent records show that at present the mainland appears to be substantially stable, whereas some coastal areas are still subsiding at a rate of about 10 mm/year with a significant threat to the environment and the infrastructures as well, although to a lesser extent than in the past decades...|$|R

40|$|Self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC) {{is a type}} of concrete, which flows {{under the}} sole influence of gravity up to <b>leveling,</b> air <b>out</b> and consolidates itself without any external compaction energy. It was a response to the lack of qualified skilled workers at the construction sites and a solution for the accomplishment of durable concrete structures. Self-compactability of a concrete mix is widely affected by the characteristics of ingredients and their proportions. Thus, it becomes necessary to develop a successful procedure for mix proportioning of SCC. The heuristic nature of the early mix proportioning methods motivated researchers to carry out extensive research on the rheological properties of SCC that has significantly improved the proportioning of SCC mixes. A rigorous proportioning method for SCC based on sound physical principles was proposed. However, such a method produces a bewildering array of mixes that reach the target plastic viscosity but does not give any practical guidelines on how to choose the most appropriate mix and does not explicitly impose compressive strength as a design criterion. These shortcomings were overcome in this work by developing a new mix proportioning method. Indeed, practical guidelines in the form of design charts were provided for choosing the mix proportions that achieve a target plastic viscosity in the range 3 to 15 Pa s (the lower limit varies with target cube compressive strength) and a target cube compressive strength in the range 30 to 80 MPa. To verify the proposed mix design method, an experimental validation was performed on a series of SCC mixes in both the fresh and hardened states. Three sets of SCC mixes were prepared jointly with other two PhD students (Abo Dhaheer, 2016; Al-Rubaye, 2016). These mixes are designated A, B, and C for the low, medium and high paste to solids ratios, respectively. (Note that mixes designated A and C were contributed by the other two named PhD students). Tests on these mixes conclusively proved the validity of the mix design approach in the sense that all the mixes met the self-compactability criteria and achieved the desired target plastic viscosity and cube compressive strength. vii Although SCC has passed from the research phase into the real application, the differences in its composition (i. e. higher paste volume and lower coarse aggregate volume) from normal vibrated concrete (NVC) raise concerns among researchers about its fracture behaviour. Thus, an experimental study has been carried out to investigate in detail the role of several composition parameters of SCC mixes on their fracture behaviour differing by the coarse aggregate volume, paste to solids ratio (p/s) and water to cementitious material (w/cm) ratio. The specific fracture energy and the tension-softening diagram of a concrete mix are the most critical parameters that describe its fracture behaviour as they form a basis for the evaluation of the load carrying capacity of cracked concrete. First, the size-dependent fracture energy (Gf) has been determined using the RILEM work-of-fracture test on three point bend specimens of a single size, half of which contained a shallow starter notch (notch to depth ratio= 0. 1), while the other half contained a deep notch (notch to depth ratio= 0. 6). Then the specific size-independent fracture energy (GF) was calculated using the simplified boundary effect formalism in which a bilinear diagram approximates the variation in the fracture energy along the unbroken specimen ligament. Finally, the bilinear approximation of the tension softening diagram corresponding to GF has been obtained using the non-linear hinge model. Predicting the flow behaviour in the formwork and linking the required rheological parameters to flow tests conducted on the site will help to optimise the casting process. A Lagrangian particle-based method, the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to model the flow of SCC mixes in the V-funnel. An incompressible SPH method was employed to simulate the flow of such a non-Newtonian fluid whose behaviour is best described by a Bingham-type model, in which the kink in the shear stress versus shear strain rate diagram is first appropriately smoothed out. The basic equations solved in the SPH are the incompressible mass conservation and momentum equations. The simulation of the SCC mixes emphasised the distribution of larger aggregates particles of different sizes throughout the flow in the 3 -dimensional V-funnel configuration. The capabilities of this methodology were validated by comparing the simulation results with the V-funnel tests carried out in the laboratory...|$|R
