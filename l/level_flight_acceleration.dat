40|$|A {{flight test}} {{maneuver}} autopilot (FTMAP) {{is currently being}} flown to increase {{the quality and quantity}} of the data obtained in the flight testing of the highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) remotely piloted research vehicle (RPRV). The FTMAP resides in a ground-based digital computer and was designed to perform certain prescribed maneuvers precisely, while maintaining critical flight parameters within close tolerances. The FTMAP operates as a non-flight-critical outer loop controller and augments the vehicle primary flight control system. The inputs to the FTMAP consist of telemetry-downlinked aircraft sensor data. During FTMAP operation, the FTMAP computer replaces normal pilot inputs to the aircraft stick and throttle positions. The FTMAP maneuvers include straight-and-level <b>flight,</b> <b>level</b> <b>accelerations</b> and decelerations, pushover pullups, and windup turns. The pushover pullups can be executed holding throttle or Mach number fixed. The windup turns can be commanded by either normal acceleration or angle of attack. The operational procedures, control mode configuration, and initial simulation results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{idealized}} energy fluctuation {{model of}} a bird's body undergoing horizontal flapping flight is developed, focusing on the biomechanical power discernible to a body-mounted accelerometer. Expressions for flight body power constructed from root mean square dynamic body accelerations and wingstroke frequency are derived from first principles and presented in dimensionally appropriate units. As wingstroke frequency increases, the model generally predicts a gradual transition in power from a linear to an asymptotically cubic relationship. However, the onset of this transition {{and the degree to}} which this occurs depends upon whether and how forward vibrations are exploited for temporary energy storage and retrieval. While this may vary considerably between species and individual birds, it is found that a quadrature phase arrangement is generally advantageous during <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> Gravity-aligned vertical <b>acceleration</b> always enters into the calculation of body power, but, whenever forward acceleration becomes relevant, its contribution is subtractive. Several novel kinematic measures descriptive of flapping flight are postulated, offering fresh insights into the processes involved in airborne locomotion. The limitations of the model are briefly discussed, and departures from its predictions during ascending and descending flight evaluated. These findings highlight how body-mounted accelerometers can offer a valuable, insightful and non-invasive technique for investigating the flight of free-ranging birds and bats...|$|R
40|$|Hummingbirds {{are known}} to defend food {{resources}} such as nectar sources from encroachment by competitors (including conspecifics). These competitive intraspecific interactions {{provide an opportunity to}} quantify the biomechanics of hummingbird flight performance during ecologically relevant natural behavior. We recorded the three-dimensional flight trajectories of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds defending, being chased from and freely departing from a feeder. These trajectories allowed us to compare natural flight performance to earlier laboratory measurements of maximum flight speed, aerodynamic force generation and power estimates. During field observation, hummingbirds rarely approached the maximal flight speeds previously reported from wind tunnel tests and never did so during <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> However, the <b>accelerations</b> and rates of change in kinetic and potential energy we recorded indicate that these hummingbirds likely operated near the maximum of their flight force and metabolic power capabilities during these competitive interactions. Furthermore, although birds departing from the feeder while chased did so faster than freely-departing birds, these speed gains were accomplished by modulating kinetic and potential energy gains (or losses) rather than increasing overall power output, essentially trading altitude for speed during their evasive maneuver. Finally, the trajectories of defending birds were directed toward the position of the encroaching bird rather than the feeder...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{mathematical}} programming problems of flight mechanics of a jet aircraft. The aircraft {{is assumed to}} be in quasi-steady flight. Different flight phases are considered here; they cover rectilinear <b>level</b> <b>flight,</b> climbing flight, gliding <b>flight,</b> and curvilinear <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> In this thesis, the problems studied include feasibility and optimization. These problems are solved via the modified quasilinearization algorithm for mathematical programming problems. Results for the different flight phases are presented here.

40|$|The base {{forces in}} the GLAST X- and Z-axis sine {{vibration}} tests {{were similar to those}} derived using generic inputs (from users guide and handbook), but the base {{forces in the}} sine test were generally greater than the flight data. Basedrive analyses using envelopes of <b>flight</b> <b>acceleration</b> data provided more accurate predictions of the base force than generic inputs, and as expected, using envelopes of both the <b>flight</b> <b>acceleration</b> and force provided even more accurate predictions The GLAST spacecraft interface accelerations and forces measured during the MECO transient were relatively low in the 60 to 150 Hz regime. One may expect the flight forces measured at the base of various spacecraft to be more dependent on the mass, frequencies, etc. of the spacecraft than are the corresponding interface acceleration data, which may depend more on the launch vehicle configuration...|$|R

Whereas these were both demilitarised, modified fighters, the fastest piston-engined aeroplane in stock (original, factory-built) condition was the German Dornier Do 335 Pfeil, with a maximum speed of 474 mph (765 km/h) in <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> The unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane (not in <b>level</b> <b>flight)</b> is held by a Supermarine Spitfire Mk IXX, which was calculated to have achieved a speed of 690 mph (1,110 km/h, Mach 0.96) in a dive on 5 February 1952.|$|R
50|$|If {{the total}} lift is kept constant, the {{vertical}} component of lift will decrease. As {{the weight of}} the aircraft is unchanged, this would result in the aircraft descending if not countered. To maintain <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> requires increased positive (up) elevator to increase the angle of attack, increase the total lift generated and keep the vertical component of lift equal with {{the weight of the}} aircraft. This cannot continue indefinitely. The total load factor required to maintain <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> {{is directly related to the}} bank angle. This means that for a given airspeed, <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> can only be maintained up to a certain given angle of bank. Beyond this angle of bank, the aircraft will suffer an accelerated stall if the pilot attempts to generate enough lift to maintain <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
