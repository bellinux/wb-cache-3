500|$|Lyrically, Madonna pleads the {{listener}} {{to stop for}} a moment, {{to get away from}} the world through music, with the lines going as: [...] "I don't know how I got to this stage / <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of my cage cause I'm dying / Turn up the radio, turn up the radio / Don't ask me where I wanna go, we gotta turn up the radio." [...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun. According to NMEs Priya Elan, [...] "the song continues [...] career-spanning themes of getting into the groove, of uniting the bourgeoisie and rebelling." [...] O'Mancey gave a detailed analysis of the lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] is {{the first}} ballad {{recorded}} by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: [...] "I smashed plates on the floor, [...] he swept them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and... eventually Chas's girlfriend Lotta <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>out...</b> I ran out to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I'd cooled down and he'd already written it." [...] The song featured a chord progression inspired by Curtis Mayfield and lyrics that reflected Hendrix's admiration of Bob Dylan. [...] "Stone Free" [...] expressed Hendrix's desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in [...] "51st Anniversary" [...] and [...] "Highway Chile". Omitted from the American version of the album, [...] "Red House" [...] would not see an official release in US until the 1969 compilation Smash Hits. An unusual feature of the recording {{is that it does}} not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of bass tones. It is Hendrix's only original twelve-bar blues.|$|E

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} good review: [...] "And if {{you thought}} we were done with surprises to set up next season, {{let me assure you}} we’re just getting started. Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> to play.” And this is a war now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview with The Memphis Press Scimitar, Elvis himself was open about the close relationship to his mother. [...] "She was the number-one girl in his life, {{and he was}} dedicating his career to her." [...] Throughout her life, [...] "the son would call her by pet names," [...] and they communicated by baby talk. Presley even shared his mother's bed [...] "up until Elvis was a young teen," [...] simply because the family was so extremely poor that they couldn't afford the luxury of two beds. According to Elaine Dundy, [...] "it was agony for her to leave her child even for a moment with anyone else, to let anyone else touch Elvis." [...] Presley himself said, [...] "My mama never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of her sight. I couldn't {{go down to the}} creek with the other kids." [...] His father, Vernon Presley, talked about Elvis's close relationship to his mother [...] "after his son became famous, almost {{as if it were a}} source of wonder that anyone could be that close." ...|$|E
