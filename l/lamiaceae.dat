5|$|Some {{members of}} the <b>Lamiaceae</b> can spread {{unchecked}} and become invasive plants. Planting of P.atriplicifolia near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides {{out of concern for}} its potential to spread, but it is not considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} <b>Lamiaceae,</b> the large genus Salvia {{had long been}} {{believed}} monophyletic, based {{on the structure of}} its stamina. Several smaller genera, including Dorystaechas, Perovskia, and Meriandra were also included in tribe Mentheae, but were thought more distantly related. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetics study based on two cpDNA genes (rbcL and trnL-F) demonstrated that Salvia is not monophyletic, but comprises three identifiable clades. Clade I is more closely related to Perovskia than to other members of Salvia.|$|E
25|$|Trace levels (0.003%) of synephrine {{have also}} been {{detected}} in the dried leaves of Pogostemon cablin (patchouli, <b>Lamiaceae).</b> It {{is also found in}} certain cactus species of the genera Coryphantha and Dolichothele.|$|E
25|$|Some species migrate. Caterpillars are {{sometimes}} covered in spines. Host plants include Acanthaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fagaceae, Flacourtiaceae, <b>Lamiaceae,</b> Loranthaceae, Moraceae, Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Urticaceae, and Verbenaceae.|$|E
25|$|The stratum {{of trees}} as such disappears, {{along with its}} {{associated}} species, replaced progressively by brush representative of a very advanced degradation; {{there is a high}} frequency of thorny plants (Scorpion's thorn, blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), etc.) and a predominance of <b>Lamiaceae</b> y compuestas (Tomillo vulgar, heather, pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium), etc.).|$|E
25|$|Until 2002, Phrymaceae {{was usually}} defined as {{consisting}} {{of only a}} single, anomalous species, Phryma leptostachya. Whenever Phrymaceae was not recognized, Phryma was usually placed in the family Verbenaceae, but sometimes in <b>Lamiaceae.</b> Mimulus and its relatives were usually placed in some version of Scrophulariaceae that was {{much larger than the}} currently accepted circumscription of that family.|$|E
25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, <b>Lamiaceae,</b> Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E
2500|$|Vitex and {{all other}} members of the family Verbenaceae save those in the {{subfamily}} Verbenoideae were recently moved to the family <b>Lamiaceae.</b> As a result of this reorganization, two monophyletic families were established from the paraphyletic Verbenaceae and polyphyletic <b>Lamiaceae.</b> This new classification scheme was initially proposed by Cantino in 1992. Subsequent cpDNA analysis, rbcL sequence analysis, chemotaxonomic studies, and morphological analyses [...] have supported the original logic for family reorganization.|$|E
2500|$|... ajedrea: {{plant in}} the genus Satureja (family <b>Lamiaceae),</b> about 30 cm in height, with many {{branches}} and dark, narrow leaves. It is cultivated as an ornamental in gardens. From Arabic assariyya or assiriyya, ultimately from Latin satureia.|$|E
2500|$|Basil [...] (Ocimum basilicum), {{also called}} great basil or Saint-Joseph's-wort, is a culinary herb {{of the family}} <b>Lamiaceae</b> (mints). It is also called the [...] "king of herbs" [...] and the [...] "royal herb". The name [...] "basil" [...] comes from Greek βασιλικόν φυτόν (basilikón phutón), [...] "royal/kingly plant".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a member}} of the mint family <b>Lamiaceae,</b> which {{includes}} many other herbs. The name [...] "rosemary" [...] derives from the Latin for [...] "dew" [...] (ros) and [...] "sea" [...] (marinus), or [...] "dew of the sea". The plant is also sometimes called anthos, from the ancient Greek word ἄνθος, meaning [...] "flower". Rosemary has a fibrous root system.|$|E
2500|$|Tuberous begonia, yams, and Cyclamen are {{commonly}} grown stem tubers. Mignonette vine (Anredera cordifolia) produces aerial stem tubers on [...] vines, the tubers {{fall to the}} ground and grow. [...] Plectranthus esculentus of the mint family <b>Lamiaceae,</b> produces tuberous under ground organs {{from the base of the}} stem, weighing up to 1.8kg per tuber, forming from axillary buds producing short stolons that grow into tubers.|$|E
2500|$|Basil grows between [...] tall, with opposite, light green, silky leaves [...] {{long and}} [...] broad. The flowers are small, white {{in color and}} {{arranged}} in a terminal spike. Unusual among <b>Lamiaceae,</b> the four stamens and the pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the corolla, but lie over the inferior lip. After entomophilous pollination, the corolla falls off and four round achenes develop inside the bilabiate calyx.|$|E
2500|$|Vitex rotundifolia is {{a member}} of the family <b>Lamiaceae</b> [...] and {{subfamily}} Viticoideae. The plant was originally described by the son of Carolus Linnaeus, Carl Linnaeus the Younger The original description was published in Supplementum Plantarum in 1782. The generic epithet, Vitex, is derived from the Latin viere, meaning “to bind or twist” in reference to the rope-like stems produced by some species in the genus. The specific epithet, rotundifolia, is derived from the Latin rotundus, which means [...] "round, spherical", and folium, meaning [...] "leaf.” This is a reference to the rounded character of the leaves.|$|E
