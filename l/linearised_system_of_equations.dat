40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} of a coupled {{system of}} nonlinear partial differential equations modelling {{the effects of}} surfactant on the spreading of a thin film on a horizontal substrate are investigated. A CFL condition is obtained from a von Neumann stability analysis of a <b>linearised</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations.</b> Numerical solutions obtained from a Roe upwind scheme with a third-order TVD Runge-Kutta approximation to the time derivative are compared to solutions obtained with a Roe-Sweby scheme coupled to a minmod limiter and a TVD approximation to the time derivative. Results from both of these schemes are compared to a Roe upwind scheme and a BDF approximation to the time derivative. In all three cases high-order approximations to the spatial derivatives are employed on the interior points of the spatial domain. The Roe-BDF scheme is shown to be an efficient numerical scheme for capturing sharp changes in gradient in the free surface profile and surfactant concentration. Numerical simulations of an initial exponential free surface profile coupled with initial surfactant concentrations for both exogenous and endogenous surfactants are considered...|$|E

Mathematical modelling includes a thermodynamic equation {{for the air}} phase and potential flow equations for the water phase. A simple three dimensional OWC geometry with a linear Power Take Off (PTO) response is considered and both the thermodynamic and potential flow equations are linearised. Analysis of the <b>linearised</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>equations</b> reveals a nondimensional coefficient which we name “compression number”. The flow potential is decomposed into scattering and radiation components, using an analogue of spring-dashpot response and {{taking into account the}} additional effects of air compressibility to wave interaction processes. We use these concepts to characterise the relative importance of the air compressibilty effects inside the OWC and to derive novel scaling relations for further investigation of scaling effects in OWC physical modelling. The predictions of the methodology are validated against large scale experimental data, where compressibility effects are evident and further application of the methodology to a realistic OWC geometry is used to demonstrate the importance of these effects to prototype scale...|$|E
