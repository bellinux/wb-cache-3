5|$|More {{people moved}} to Lajjun during the British mandate period, {{particularly}} in the <b>late</b> <b>thirties,</b> due to the British crackdown on participants in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The tomb of Yusuf Hamdan, a local leader of the revolt, {{is located in the}} village. Lajjun's economy grew rapidly {{as a result of the}} influx of the additional population. As the village expanded, it was divided into three quarters, one to the east, one to the west, and another known as Khirbat al-Khan. Each quarter was inhabited by one or more hamulas ("clans"); the al-Mahajina al-Tahta and al-Ghubariyya clans, the al-Jabbarin and al-Mahamid clans, and the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa clan.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, {{but when he was}} in his <b>late</b> <b>thirties</b> his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.|$|E
5|$|Some pre-Code movies {{suffered}} {{irreparable damage}} from censorship after 1934. When studios attempted to re-issue films from the 1920s and early 1930s, {{they were forced}} to make extensive cuts. Films such as Mata Hari (1931), Arrowsmith (1931), and A Farewell to Arms (1932) exist only in their censored versions. Many other films survived intact because they were too controversial to be re-released, such as The Maltese Falcon (1931), which was remade a decade later with the same name, and thus never had their master negatives edited. In the case of Convention City (1933), which Breen would not allow to be re-released in any form, the entire film remains missing. Although it has been rumored that all prints and negatives were ordered destroyed by Jack Warner in the <b>late</b> <b>thirties,</b> further research shows the negative was in the vaults as late as 1948 when it was junked due to nitrate decomposition.|$|E

5|$|The story {{followed}} Roy Race, a striker for {{the fictional}} football team Melchester Rovers, based {{in a town}} {{of the same name}} in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his <b>late</b> <b>thirties</b> by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.|$|E

Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

25|$|Goalkeepers {{often have}} longer playing careers than outfield players, many not {{retiring}} until their <b>late</b> <b>thirties</b> or early forties. This {{can be explained}} by noting that goalkeepers play a less physically demanding position that requires significantly less running. For example, Peter Shilton played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997 before retiring at the age of 47. Another explanation of this is that {{due to the nature of}} this position, goalkeepers use their experience more often than field players.|$|E

When 16-year-old Michelle falls pregnant, she refuses to name the father, fearing repercussions for Den and herself. When she gives birth to a daughter Vicki in 1986, Den is not allowed any contact with her; he is allowed to hold his daughter once and supported Michelle financially in secret.

Of the Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire landed gentry, he was educated at The Oratory School (a Roman Catholic school) and Woburn School, Weybridge, where he arrived in 1885, and finally at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was active as a cricketer and violinist. At the age of 22 he married Lady Winifride Mary Elizabeth Feilding, a daughter of Rudolph Feilding, 8th Earl of Denbigh. After Oxford he trained as a lawyer and diplomat, spending some years in Brussels, where he began his first formal singing lessons {{at the age of}} 28. However, he had to overcome a social convention which resisted a member of the upper classes becoming a professional singer, and {{it was not until the}} early 1900s, in his <b>late</b> <b>thirties,</b> that he gave his first professional performances in London. His principal teachers were Jacques Bouhy in Paris (1901–03), and in London Henry Russell and Victor Biegel, who remained his friend and teacher throughout his life. Bouhy asked him to decide between a baritone career in opera or a tenor career in oratorio and concert, and he chose the latter.|$|E
