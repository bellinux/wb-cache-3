5|$|After {{missing the}} Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers over the summer, Miami's eight {{pre-season}} games and first seven regular season games {{to recover from}} off-season <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> and left shoulder surgeries, Wade made his first appearance of the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007. Battling pain in his <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> throughout the season, Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance. However, with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in his <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 {{games of the season}} to undergo OssaTron treatment on his <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game for the season.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2016, Hughes {{was struck}} in the <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> off a line drive from J. T. Realmuto and left the game. The next day, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list due to <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> contusion. He was ruled out for 6-8 weeks. On June 11, it was revealed that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.

5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} season, Portland was overcome with injuries {{from the start of}} the 2010–11 season. Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams both suffered knee injuries that sidelined them for the season; Portland later waived Pendergraph. In November, they announced that Oden would have microfracture surgery on his <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> ending his 2010–2011 season. This injury marked Oden's third NBA season cut short due to a knee injury. Three-time All-Star Brandon Roy underwent double-arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair both knees after dealing with constant struggles, leaving his future up in the air. Just days after, Marcus Camby also underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair his <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E

Glycosaminoglycan and protein synthesis and cell replication were separately analysed utilising 35 SO 4, 14 C-Glycine, and 3 H-thymidine, respectively. Pitting, ulceration, and osteophytes, seen only in the PM knees, increased over the 12 -week period of study. 3 H-thymidine and 14 C-glycine incorporations by PM cartilage were increased at 3 weeks, less than nonoperated control animals at 9 weeks, and approximated to those of controls at 12 weeks. 35 SO 4 incorporation by tibial osteophytes was decreased at 9 and 12 weeks. Similar isotope incorporations seen after partial meniscectomy and sham surgery represented a nonspecific response to arthrotomy.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a regeneração da cartilagem {{articular}} em defeitos osteocondrais do joelho induzidos pelo plasma rico em plaquetas (PRP) autógeno. MÉTODOS: Defeitos osteocondrais produzidos no sulco troclear de ambos os joelhos de dez ovelhas foram preenchidos com PRP autógeno à direita e deixados vazios à esquerda. Avaliação macroscópica e histológica foram efetuadas 12 semanas mais tarde. Os resultados foram avaliados por um escore geral de ambas as avaliações macroscópica e histológica comparativamente entre os lados por meio do teste pareado de Wilcoxon. RESULTADOS: o aspecto macroscópico não foi uniforme entre os animais, nem diferiu entre os joelhos direitos e esquerdos (p= 0, 03125); em nenhum caso o tecido regenerado se nivelou com a cartilagem normal circundante. Ao exame histológico, cartilagem aparentemente normal não foi detectada em nenhum joelho, mas uma cartilagem pouco diferenciada estava presente em sete joelhos direitos e em três joelhos esquerdos. Tecido fibrocartilaginoso estava presente nos joelhos restantes, com diferença significante no escore geral entre os joelhos direitos e esquerdos (p= 0, 0313). CONCLUSÃO: o PRP como usado neste estudo tem propriedades reparativas da cartilagem articular no joelho de ovelhas, principalmente por estimular a formação de tecido fibrocartilaginoso. Trabalho Experimental. OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} the regeneration of osteochondral defects in the joint cartilage of the knee induced by autologous platelet-rich plasma (pRp). METHODS: osteochondral defects produced in the trochlear groove of both knees of ten sheep; defects of the right knees were filled with autologous pRp and the <b>left</b> <b>knees</b> were <b>left</b> unfilled. macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was carried out 12 week later. the results were evaluated by the total score of both macroscopic and microscopic evaluations comparing the two sides through the wilcoxon paired test. RESULTS: macroscopic appearance was not uniform among animals, nor was it different between the right and <b>left</b> <b>knees</b> (p= 0. 3125), and in no case the regenerated tissue was equal to the normal surrounding cartilage. at histological examination, apparently normal cartilage was not detected in any knee, but a poorly differentiated cartilage was present in 7 right knees, compared to 3 <b>left</b> <b>knees.</b> fibrocartilaginous tissue was present {{in most of the}} remaining knees, with {{a significant difference in the}} overall score between right and <b>left</b> <b>knees</b> (p= 0. 0313).

5|$|In 1967–68, {{his second}} season, {{injuries}} limited Orr to just 46 {{games in which}} he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time {{to play in the}} NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage. Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Different {{sources of}} variations, such as electrogoniometer {{characteristics}} and procedures, {{may affect the}} accuracy and precision of movement measurements during gait. Objective: To quantify the variations and compare the effects produced by different sources of variation in electrogoniometric gait recordings: the sensors, procedures (trials) and the knee joint. Methods: Knee flexion/extension and valgus/varus movements were recorded during gait on the treadmill. The recordings were partitioned into strides and normalized in time using a routine developed in MatLab. Mean curves for the knee during gait were derived from 50 strides, and seven conditions were evaluated: one comparing pairs of sensors; two comparing pairs of different trials (including variations due to sensors); and four comparing the right and <b>left</b> <b>knees</b> (including variations due to sensors and trials). Mean standard deviations of the differences were calculated. To estimate the variations relating to the trial and the knee joint, the compound standard deviations were transformed into variances and split into their components. Results: The variation introduced by pairs of sensors in the same model applied in one trial was smaller than the variation introduced by the same sensor used in two consecutive trials. Furthermore, the variation introduced by {{the difference between the}} right and <b>left</b> <b>knees</b> was greater than the variation introduced by the difference between sensors (A and B) and trials (1 and 2). Conclusions: It is, therefore, preferable to use different sensors in the same data recording (simultaneous) than use the same sensor in two different recordings (consecutive) ...|$|R

Method: Sixteen adult New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 to 7 months, weighing between 2 and 2. 5 kg and without locomotor system abnormalities were studied. In all the animals, a defect {{was made in the}} femoral condyles of the right and <b>left</b> <b>knees,</b> measuring 3. 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth, using a trephine. The animals were divided into two groups: study group formed by the right knees, in which the medial and lateral condyles received implants of SCBG; and control group formed by the <b>left</b> <b>knees,</b> in which the medial and lateral condyles were allowed to heal naturally. The knees were assessed 90, 120 and 180 days after the operation. After the animals had been sacrificed, the anatomical specimens were resected and placed in Bouin's solution. They were then photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 5400 ® coupled to a Nikon SM 2800 ® stereoscopic loupe, to analyze the surface, coloring, consistency, continuity and healing. Results: The results were evaluated using the chi-square test. There {{were no significant differences in}} the macroscopic assessments of healing between the study and control groups.
