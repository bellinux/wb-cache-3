5|$|Novikov was {{released}} six years into his sentence following Stalin's death on June 29, 1953, and reinstated as Chief Marshal of Aviation, {{where he was}} able to put his ideas into practice. A plan for using newly available jet aircraft and nuclear weapons to wage a possible future war with the United States was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Novikov and shown to Nikita Khrushchev, who turned the proposal down in favor of ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, The Rock {{announced}} he would face the WWE Champion at the Royal Rumble. During the show, he encountered WWE Champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena, all of whom {{expressed a desire to}} face him. He later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to be <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> CM Punk.|$|E

5|$|The grounds were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Humphry Repton (1752–1818) {{a leading}} {{landscape}} gardener. Parts of Repton's designs still exist, notably the carriage drive which winds {{its way from}} the house, sections of which follow the original route. In addition to the conservatory and the almshouses in Blaise Hamlet, Nash built the limestone dairy in 1802.|$|E
5|$|The house {{started as}} a small {{farmhouse}} in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was {{the property of the}} Napper family for centuries. It was given to the National Trust in 1954. The Arts and Crafts style garden is modeled on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park and in the 17th century a formal garden was constructed. This had largely disappeared until a new garden was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> garden designer Gertrude Jekyll (1843—1932) in an Arts and Crafts-style. It now contains walled kitchen gardens, fruit orchards and ornamental gardens.|$|E

5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a {{symmetrical}} facade with projecting wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan portico. The interior of the stone house is decorated with extensive plaster mouldings to ceilings and fireplaces. The grounds and gardens were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Humphry Repton, but have since been reduced in size.|$|E
5|$|By law, {{the flag}} {{is to be}} made of , a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The {{manufacturing}} process and specifications for the flag are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of imports and exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.|$|E

5|$|Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders. The {{boundaries}} were unclear as <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the treaty, {{which even}} the French had never formally described. France insisted {{that only the}} Acadian peninsula {{was included in the}} treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George's War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Gratiot Avenue in Detroit {{was one of}} the {{original}} avenues <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Judge Augustus Woodward after the Detroit fire in 1805. It was later used as a supply road for Fort Gratiot in Port Huron under authorization from the US Congress in the 1820s. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 and signposted with a number in 1919. Later, it was used as a segment of US Highway25 (US25) before that highway was functionally replaced by Interstate94 (I-94) in the 1960s. The M-3 designation was applied to the current highway in 1973, and a southern section was reassigned to M-85 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1790 <b>by</b> William Emes.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the rest}} of the 20th century many {{recreation}} facilities were incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling green in the Recreation Grounds was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the City Council in 1962 to join the green in the Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) we see today. The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Partly because 2009 was {{the fourth}} centenary of Galileo's first {{recorded}} astronomical observations with the telescope, the United Nations scheduled {{it to be the}} International Year of Astronomy. A global scheme was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the International Astronomical Union (IAU), also endorsed by UNESCO—the UN body responsible for educational, scientific and cultural matters. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
50|$|The village proper {{was first}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1826 <b>by</b> Judge Richardson.|$|R
50|$|The {{small village}} of Speers across the river, <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1860 <b>by</b> a kinsman, gets {{its name from}} the same family. North Belle Vernon, in Westmoreland County, was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1872 <b>by</b> Louis and was {{incorporated}} in 1876. Louis died two years later in 1878 and is buried at the Rehoboth Presbyterian Church Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|Bentleyville was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1831 <b>by</b> Adamson Bentley, {{and named}} for him.|$|R
5|$|Since the 19th century archaeological {{excavations}} {{have taken}} place in the priory grounds, though a substantial part of the site has not yet been investigated. In addition to the east window, surviving visible fragments of the complex include the lower courses of the west range, a vaulted undercroft, a gateway and a 14th-century dovecote still in use today. The adjoining Priory Gardens, <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Chaloners in the 18th century, are under restoration by a volunteer group. The priory ruins and gardens {{are open to the public}} throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties {{of water from the}} springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E
5|$|By the 1st century BC, {{during the}} Hellenistic period, the Greeks {{had begun to}} develop their own {{mathematical}} schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries. To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Ptolemy. They were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.|$|E
