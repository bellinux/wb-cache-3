40|$|Lacan's {{conception}} of Eros revolves around. a presentification of lack. It is my contention that King Lear invites a theoretical reading of kin(g) ship as such. presentification of lack [...] Indeed, {{the dialectic of}} desire in the text derives from King <b>Lear.</b> <b>s</b> discovering that his own kingly signifier signifies nothing. This error of judgment, which stems from a confusion be-tween desire and jouissance, leads him to misappropriate the rules of both kingship and kinship. Interestingly enough, it is Cordelia, the daughter and subject with whom he is erotically involved, who brings home to him the truth of his error. As an incestuous drama of signification, then, King Lear not only relates to the Phallus as master signifier, {{but also to the}} Name-of-the-Father as referent of the law. Moreover, the truth Cordelia speaks is a 'half-said' that leads to the 'abolition of discourse': muteness, madness and death. Thus, if the violence implicit in the erotics of the play strikes at the 'self-contained character of the participators'. it strikes first at the core of language...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} an IMF-like {{coinsurance}} arrangement among countries {{can play a}} useful role in the global financial system. The operation of the coinsurance arrangement is examined under different loan contracts. It shows that, if the IMF 4 s objective is to safeguard its resources and {{be concerned about the}} welfare of the borrower, an ex ante loan contract is more likely to create the right incentives than an ex post loan contract. Such contracts highlight the need for precommitment to contend with the Samaritan 4 s dilemma and time inconsistency, and state-contingent repayment schemes to deal with King <b>Lear</b> 4 <b>s</b> dilemma...|$|R

40|$|The recent year's {{development}} in the industry has led to that procurement activities have increased in its importance. All in all, this means two changed prerequisites. Totally new claims will be charged on the procurement department. Further will also the relations to the company's suppliers' change. In order {{to cope with this}} development the companies have been forced to create systems for measuring, evaluating and developing suppliers as a way to reach higher competitiveness. In this thesis we develop a common general process {{in the form of a}} recommendation to improve the essential parts of <b>Lear</b> Corporation&# 39 <b>s</b> suppliers&# 39 delivery service performance. To solve our problem we investigate literature and previous research in the subject. We also conduct a benchmarking study of five companies in order to get ideas of how to approach the problem. In our recommendation we define some essential key variables in the area of delivery service and give suggestions for supplier evaluation. If the supplier diverge from the objectives we recommend a four step supplier development process...|$|R

Clinical cases of vitamin E deficiencies have been diagnosed in camelids and may indicate that these species are more sensitive to inadequate vitamin E in hay-based diets compared to other ruminant and equine species. In bovine, cholesterol {{has been reported to}} affect vitamin E concentrations. In order to evaluate vitamin E deficiencies in camelids, the effects of collection and storage of the blood samples prior to processing were necessary. Reports vary as to factors affecting vitamin E and cholesterol in blood samples, and diagnostic laboratories vary in instructions regarding sample handling. Blood was collected from healthy alpacas and processed under conditions including exposure to fluorescent light, serum and red blood cell contact, tube stopper contact, temperature, and hemolysis. Serum vitamin E and cholesterol concentrations were then measured. Statistical analyses found that the vitamin E concentrations decreased with prolonged contact with the tube stopper and with increasing hemolysis. Vitamin E concentration variations were seen with other factors but were not significant. Time prior to serum separation and individual animal variation was found to alter cholesterol concentrations within the sample, yet this finding was clinically unremarkable. No correlation was seen between vitamin E and cholesterol concentration, possibly due to lack of variation of cholesterol. 1...|$|R
40|$|Jonathan Lear 2 ̆ 7 s Racial Hope {{is a most}} remarkable, engaging, and thought-provoking {{interpretation}} of one man 2 ̆ 7 s account {{of the collapse of}} his culture, as well as the hope he offers for a future for his people. Based on the life story of Plenty Coups (as recorded by Frank Linderman during the late 1920 <b>s),</b> <b>Lear</b> considers two equally profound images offered by this Crow elder, one eng rained in the statement, 2 ̆ 2 after this nothing happened, 2 ̆ 2 referring to what happened after being placed on a reservation, and the other in the medicine dreams of Plenty Coups in which the destruction of the Indian people is foretold for all but those who follow the example of the Chickadee, listening and learning from the mistakes of others. Plenty Coups thus provides the Crow with what Lear calls a 2 ̆ 2 radical hope 2 ̆ 2 for renewal that survives their destruction, though in a form of survival that could not be anticipated at the time. During {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century, Plenty Coups and the Crow indeed experienced seemingly overwhelming forces that sought a complete annihilation of their way of life. Lear identifies two pivotal Crow cultural expressions, the planting of the coup stick during battle and buffalo hunting, the elimination of which led to the collapse of all that was meaningful for the Crow. Lear frames the particular challenge of Plenty Coups and the Crow within the larger human context, asking how would any of us react in the face of a complete collapse of our culture? What are the possibilities for hope...|$|R
