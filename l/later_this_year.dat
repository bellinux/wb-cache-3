5|$|On June 14, 1981, Har Mar Mall {{was damaged}} {{by a large}} tornado during the {{afternoon}} hours. While the mall wasn't heavily damaged and only affected the mall's cosmetic appearance, several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact. Shortly after the tornado, a large renovation occurred to update the mall's appearance and fix any damage left by it. In 1988, another expansion took place, allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared <b>later</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> along {{with the addition of}} a new food court with seating for over 400 people. Three years later, the Highland Superstore was converted to BizMart, a regional office supply store. BizMart was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995; HomePlace opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax, and is currently leased by HomeGoods, the successor of HomePlace. In the 2000s, Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner Emmes Realty Services nearly $12 million; Emmes sparked interest in opening a Von Maur at the center, but the proposal eventually dissolved.|$|E

25|$|The {{expression}} 6d {{works the}} same way. Increasing d by some number y {{indicates that the}} full moon occurs y days <b>later</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> and hence we should compensate y days less. Adding 6d is mod 7 the same as subtracting d, which is the desired operation. Thus, again, we do subtraction by adding under modulo arithmetic. In total, the variable e contains the step from {{the day of the}} full moon to the nearest following Sunday, between 0 and 6 days ahead. The constant N provides the starting point for the calculations for each century and depends on where Jan 1, year 1 was implicitly located when the Gregorian calendar was constructed.|$|E
