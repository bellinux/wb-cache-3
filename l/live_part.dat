5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others <b>live</b> <b>part</b> {{of their lives in}} villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E

2500|$|Sockets are {{required}} to mate correctly with BS1363 plugs (as opposed to {{the dimensions of the}} socket contacts being specified). [...] This is checked by means of the use of various gauges which are specified in the standard; these gauges ensure that the socket contacts are correctly positioned and make effective and secure contact with the plug pins. [...] There is no provision for establishing the interchangeability with any other device having plug pins incorporated, but which is not covered by BS1363 (for example a charger or socket cover) unless that device conforms precisely to the plug pin dimensions specified. [...] The insertion of non-compliant plugs may damage sockets. [...] The important socket dimensions which the standard does specify are: [...] A minimum insertion of 9.6mm {{from the face of the}} socket-outlet to the first point of contact with a <b>live</b> <b>part,</b> a minimum distance of 9.5mm from the line and neutral apertures to the periphery of the socket face, and not to exceed dimensions for the apertures of 7.2mm x 4.8mm (line and neutral) and 8.8mm x 4.8mm (earth).|$|E
2500|$|On {{the death}} of his uncle, Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, on 22 August 1893, the Duke of Edinburgh {{inherited}} the vacant duchy (his elder brother the Prince of Wales had renounced his right to the succession). Upon her husband's ascension to the Ducal throne, Maria Alexandrovna became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in addition of being Duchess of Edinburgh. Unlike her husband, disgruntled to leave his career in the navy, Maria Alexandrovna thoroughly enjoyed her new role. She found the country [...] "charming" [...] and the prospect of [...] "a new fine position, with plenty to do" [...] a [...] "real God-send". Known for its hunting forest and picturesque castles, the ducal estate was small, compromising separate lands in Coburg, Gotha, Upper Austria, and Tyrol, but there she could live according to her desires in a domain of her own. [...] The family moved to Schloss Ehrenburg, the Duke's official residence, but they all preferred their summer house, Schloss Rosenau, a gingerbread-yellow villa on a hill with views of the surrounding countryside. They also had two residences in Gotha, where they had to <b>live</b> <b>part</b> of the year: Schloss Friedenstein and Schloss Reinhardsbrunn, which the Duke enjoyed for its hunting grounds. The Duchess took on updating the badly furnished castles, and also charitable works, opening an establishment for the mentally challenged that bore her name. Her passions were the opera and the theater, which she supported both in Coburg and in Gotha. The Duchess was also an avid reader and enjoyed mushroom hunting.|$|E

Well, Mr. Robarts, I wish you joy." [...] And she gave him her hand in token of her sincerity. Mark took her hand, resolving to say nothing further on that occasion. That Lady Lufton was not now cordial with him, as she used to be, he was well aware; {{and sooner or later}} he was determined to have the matter out with her. He would ask her why she now so constantly met him with a taunt, and so seldom greeted him with that kind old affectionate smile which he knew and appreciated so well. That she was honest and true he was quite sure. If he asked her the question plainly, she would answer him openly. And if he could induce her to say that she would return to her old ways, return to them she would in a hearty manner. But he could not do this just at present. It was but a day or two since Mr. Crawley had been with him; and was it not probable that Mr. Crawley had been sent thither by Lady Lufton? His own hands were not clean enough for a remonstrance at the present moment. He would cleanse them, and then he would remonstrate. [...] "Would you like to <b>live</b> <b>part</b> of the year in Barchester?" [...] he said to his wife and sister that evening.|$|E
