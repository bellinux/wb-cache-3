Under Australian law, where an employee is the author, the first owner of copyright is the employer (this is slightly different from the US works-made-for-hire doctrine: in Australia, duration of copyright is still measured by the lifetime of the employee author). In 2004–2005, Australia also introduced some complicated provisions that give performers part ownership rights in sound recordings, and directors some <b>limited</b> <b>ownership</b> rights in relation to films.|$|E

500|$|The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is {{regarded}} as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, What is Property?, published in 1840. It {{is for this reason that}} some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is [...] "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In What is Property? Proudhon answers with the famous accusation [...] "Property is theft." [...] In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed [...] "property" [...] (propriété), where owners have complete rights to [...] "use and abuse" [...] their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called [...] "possession," [...] or <b>limited</b> <b>ownership</b> of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that [...] "Property is Liberty" [...] and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.|$|E

This report listed 12,355 estates, totaling 6000000 acre, which had been seized and redistributed to 119,000 families of landless farmers, 83,000 refugee families, and some 300,000 in other categories.

The law, however, does not anticipate the transfer of title in fee simply to indigenous minorities. The law does not recognize development rights, some proprietary rights including compensation for damage to the property, and limited exclusionary rights. It is not clear, however, whether protection of nature in the traditional places of inhabitation implies a right to exclude conflicting uses that are destructive to nature or whether {{they have the right}} to veto development.|$|E
50|$|Radio {{homogenization}} is a {{trend towards}} similar programming within broadcast radio in the United States. It is partially {{a result of the}} conglomeration of radio companies, particularly after the enactment of the now controversial Telecommunications Act of 1996. The bill relaxed regulations that <b>limited</b> <b>ownership</b> of radio stations, and subsequently their ownership became greatly consolidated. A number of the resulting large radio companies have been accused of broadcasting less new music, emulating a same-ness on the airwaves. Consolidation has allowed bigger companies to transition to a more profitable nationalized target marketing model, forcing local independent radio stations to adjust to the financial realities of their competitors. Corporate interests tend to favor the cost benefits of efficiency, however consolidation is reported to have significant effects on overall radio programming in the US.|$|E

50|$|Between June 15 and August 2 of 1985, ACORN {{supported}} {{homeless people}} to take over 25 city-owned buildings in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.

In order to preserve democratic decision making and affordability to the buildings the squatters organized themselves into collective members of a Mutual Housing Association.

5000|$|The {{collectivisation}} {{of private}} and state owned agricultural land in East Germany was the progression of a policy of food security (at the expense of large scale bourgeois farmers). It began in the years of Soviet occupation (1945-48) {{as part of the}} need to govern resources in the Soviet Sector. Beginning with the forced expropriation of all land holdings in excess of 100 ha, land was redistributed in small packets of around 5 to 7 ha to incoming landless refugees driven off lost German territory to the east. These Neubauern (new farmers) were given <b>limited</b> <b>ownership</b> rights to the land, meaning that they kept it as long as they worked it. In the early 1950s, remaining farmers with largish holdings (60 to 80 ha) were effectively driven out of business through means such as denying access to pooled machinery and by setting production targets that rose exponentially with amount of land owned to levels that were impossible to meet.|$|E
