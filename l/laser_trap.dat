The <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> consists of a primary trapping beam, and a counterpropagating self-pumped phase conjugate beam, the latter being derived from the primary signalbeam when it is transmitted through the sample and phase conjugated in a photorefractive crystal. Using a fundamental TEMOO gaussian beam from an Ar-ion laser (514 nm), and a barium titanate (BaTiO 3) crystal in the CAT (total internal reflection) geometry, an optical <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> was created using 25 mW of laser power.

40|$|This thesis reports {{exploratory}} research on new optical and chemical phenomena of molecular, metal and nanoparticle systems induced in a confined optical field. We {{provide important insights}} on reconfiguration dynamics in liquid crystal droplets, and deposition and patterning of metal nanostructures on graphene by continuous wave (cw) laser irradiation. Molecular orientation in individual laser-trapped liquid crystal droplets propagates from the focus {{to the surface of}} the droplets. Localized photoexcitation of a single layer graphene leads to the reduction of gold ions in solution depositing single aggregates of nanoparticles. However, the dynamics involving gradient force characteristics of <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> remain unclarified and are left for future experiments. The electronic orbital of the deposited material is changed, which enables us to monitor the deposition process by Raman spectroscopy. This deposition method can be applied to various metals and extended to nanostructure fabrication. We have succeeded in demonstrating the high potential of <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> in the manipulation and fabrication of functional material. We also report unique results on femtosecond (fs) <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> dynamics of dielectric nanoparticles and quantum dots. Polystyrene nanoparticles show trapping and consequent ejection behavior, while silica nanoparticles do not although their mechanical and optical parameters are similar. When the surface of the silica nanoparticles is silanized, the directional ejection is realized. Hydrophobic interactions lead to formation of a single transient assembly of the nanoparticles in the trapping well, which is critical for the unique trapping and ejection behavior. Quantum dots with the size of a few nm are efficiently <b>trapped</b> by fs <b>laser,</b> although it is difficult by cw <b>laser.</b> In fs <b>trapping,</b> temporal force and nonlinear optical susceptibility contribute to gradient force, and the importance of two photon excitation is confirmed. These results indicate that the fs laser exerts a strong attractive and scattering force upon nanoparticles, depending on their optical and material conditions, resulting in their specific trapping, assembly formation, ejection leading to local flow, and so on. We have explored a new fs <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> phenomenon, on which a next generation <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> study will be made.

40|$|An {{integrated}} robotic laser and microscope {{system has}} been developed to automatically analyze individual sperm motility and energetics. The custom-designed optical system directs near-infrared laser light into an inverted microscope to create a single-point 3 -D gradient <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> at the focal spot of the microscope objective. A two-level computer structure is described that quantifies the sperm motility (in terms of swimming speed and swimming force) and energetics (measuring mid-piece membrane potential) using real-time tracking (done by the upper-level system) and fluorescent ratio imaging (done by the lower-level system). The communication between these two systems is achieved by a gigabit network. The custom-built image processing algorithm identifies the sperm swimming trajectory in real-time using phase contrast images, and then subsequently traps the sperm by automatically moving the microscope stage to relocate the sperm to the <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> focal plane. Once the sperm is stably trapped (determined by the algorithm), the algorithm can also gradually reduce the laser power by rotating the polarizer in the laser path to measure the trapping power at which the sperm is capable of escaping the trap. To monitor the membrane potential of the mitochondria located in a sperm's mid-piece, the sperm is treated with a ratiometrically-encoded fluorescent probe. The proposed algorithm can relocate the sperm {{to the center of}} the ratio imaging camera and the average ratio value can be measured in real-time. The three parameters, sperm escape power, sperm swimming speed and ratio values of the mid-piece membrane potential of individual sperm can be compared with respect to time. This two-level automatic system to study individual sperm motility and energetics has not only increased experimental throughput by an order of magnitude but also has allowed us to monitor sperm energetics prior to and after exposure to the <b>laser</b> <b>trap.</b> This system should have application in both the human fertility clinic and in animal husbandry. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008...|$|E

Forces are calculated over the entire cross-section of the sphere using TEM 00 and TEM 01 * mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction. Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of 10 mW and a relative index of refraction of 1. 2 we compute trapping forces as high as ∼ 1. 2 × 10 - 6 dynes in the weakest (backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics...|$|R
