40|$|The <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> usually {{originates}} {{from the}} posterior {{trunk of the}} internal iliac artery. The current study of 342 specimens from 171 cadavers (79 male, 92 female) investigated the origin and course of the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b> It was observed to arise from the posterior trunk in 79. 1 %. Occasionally it originated from the anterior trunk that occurred in 1 %. It arose from the sciatic artery in 8. 8 %, from the superior gluteal artery in 16. 8 %, and from the inferior gluteal artery in 5. 4 %. Conversely, the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> is congenital absence in 0. 3 %. In addition, the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> was single, double, triple, and quadruple in 77. 2 %, 19. 8 %, 2. 3 %, and 0. 3 %, respectively. Consequently, variability of the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> origin is due to vascular demand as the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> plexus does arise from the earlier trunk development. With variability of the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> origin, there is a variability of the sciatic nerve supply. Knowing the variability of origins, surgeons have to avoid prolonged ligation of the internal iliac artery or its posterior trunk during surgical procedures which may lead to sciatic neuropathy.

40|$|Abstract The {{internal}} iliac artery (IIA) {{is one of}} {{the branches}} of the common iliac artery and supplies the pelvic viscera, the musculoskeletal part of the pelvis, the gluteal region, the medial thigh region and the perineum. During routine cadaveric dissection of a male cadaver for undergraduate Medical students, we observed variation in the course and branching pattern of the left IIA. The artery gave rise to two common trunks and then to the middle rectal artery, inferior vesicle artery and superior vesicle artery. The first, slightly larger, common trunk gave rise to an unnamed <b>artery,</b> the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> and the superior gluteal artery. The second, smaller, common trunk entered the gluteal region through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis muscle and presented a stellate branching pattern deep to the gluteus maximus muscle.

50|$|The pelvic {{surface of}} the sacrum is concave from the top, and curved {{slightly}} from side to side. Its middle part is crossed by four transverse ridges, which correspond to the original planes of separation between the five sacral vertebrae. The body of the first segment is large and has {{the form of a}} lumbar vertebra; the bodies of the next bones get progressively smaller, are flattened from the back, and curved to shape themselves to the sacrum, being concave in front and convex behind. At each end of the transverse ridges, are four anterior sacral foramina, diminishing in size in line with the smaller vertebral bodies. The foramina give exit to the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves and entrance to the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Each part at the sides of the foramina, is traversed by four broad, shallow grooves, which lodge the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves. They are separated by prominent ridges of bone which give origin to the piriformis muscle.

40|$|OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We {{report the}} third {{case of an}} {{aneurysm}} of the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> (AnLSA). In all cases, because of an incorrect preoperative diagnosis, the surgeons were confronted with severe and unexpected hemorrhaging, and surgery was aborted without effective treatment. Our purpose is to present the preoperative features of AnLSA and its treatment modalities. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 54 -year-old man had a medical history of renal transplantation on his left external iliac artery. He complained of acute lumbar pain associated with cauda equina syndrome, which resolved within a few hours. At that time, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed an intracanal hematoma extending from S 1 to T 12. Six weeks later, a second MRI scan demonstrated an oval-shaped intracanal mass behind the vertebral body of S 1 with intense gadolinium enhancement. INTERVENTION: An anterior epidural mass was found. An incision into this mass resulted in significant arterial hemorrhaging. Transparietal embolization with a cotton compress and closure of the aneurysm wall were performed. The postoperative clinical status was stable, and a delayed angiographic study suggested a diagnosis of aneurysm of the right LSA, {{a branch of the}} internal iliac artery. Its pathophysiology was explained by the development of a high-flow transpelvic shunt from the right iliac artery territory to the left, to maintain the renal graft blood flow that had initially been reduced by stenosis of the left common iliac artery. Six weeks later, a new MRI scan demonstrated that the AnLSA had increased in size. The lesion was then excluded endovascularly by injection of glue. CONCLUSION: A medical history of renal transplantation with MRI scans showing an anterior epidural mass behind S 1 or a spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma are features that must evoke a diagnosis of AnLSA. Treatment is mandatory and is best achieved by embolization. Surgery based on angiographic findings is indicated if the lesion is responsible for a compressive hematoma...|$|R

30|$|Neurologic {{complications}} due to {{spinal cord}} ischemia (SCI) after elective infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, while catastrophic, rarely happen. Approximately 1 in 400 cases occur after open AAA repair while 1 in 5000 occur after arterial reconstruction of occlusive aortoiliac disease [1]. Possible causes of these adverse events include infarction of {{the spinal cord}} from direct interruption of the cord blood supply or a critical collateral, systemic hypo-perfusion, atheromatous embolic infarction, or spontaneous thrombosis of an atherosclerotic radicular artery [2]. Prolonged aortic occlusion, intraoperative hypotension, and interruption of the internal iliac artery circulation have also been proposed as possible causative factors [3]. Perfusion of the distal spinal cord {{is derived from the}} lumbar, iliolumbar, and <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Branches of these arteries anastomose with the intrinsic spinal arteries {{at the level of the}} conus medullaris. When the greater radicular artery is compromised, however, pelvic blood supply can become critically important.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{cases of}} adult spinal {{vascular}} malformations presenting {{in conjunction with}} spinal dysraphism {{have been reported in}} the literature. Two of these involved male patients with a combined dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) and lipomyelomeningocele. The authors present the third case of a patient with an extraspinal DAVF and associated lipomyelomeningocele in a lumbosacral location. A 58 -year-old woman with rapid decline in bilateral motor function 10 years after a prior L 4 - 5 laminectomy and cord detethering for diagnosed tethered cord underwent magnetic resonance imaging showing evidence of persistent cord tethering and a lipomyelomeningocele. Diagnostic spinal angiogram showed a DAVF with arterial feeders from bilateral sacral and the right internal iliac arteries. The patient underwent Onyx embolization of both feeding right and left <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries.</b> At 6 -month follow-up, MRI revealed decreased flow voids and new collateralized supply to the DAVF.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} cadaver {{study is}} to define the {{anatomic}} structures on anterior sacrum, which are under the risk of injury during bicortical screw application to the S 1 and S 2 pedicles. Thirty formaldehyde-preserved human male cadavers were studied. Posterior midline incision was performed, and soft tissues and muscles were dissected from the posterior part of the lumbosacral region. A 6  mm pedicle screw was inserted between the superior facet of S 1 and the S 1 foramen. The entry point of the S 2 pedicle screw was located between S 1 and S 2 foramina. S 1 and S 2 screws were placed on both {{right and the left}} sides of all cadavers. Then, all cadavers were turned into supine position. All abdominal and pelvic organs were moved away and carefully observed for any injury. The tips of the sacral screws were marked and the relations with the anatomic structures were defined. The position of the sacral screws relative to the middle and <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins, and the sacral sympathetic trunk were measured. There was no injury to the visceral organs. In four cases, S 1 screw tip was in direct contact with middle sacral artery. In two cases, S 1 screw tip was in direct contact with middle sacral vein. It was observed that the S 1 screw tips were in close proximity to sacral sympathetic trunk on both right and the left sides. The tip of the S 2 screw was in contact with middle sacral artery on the left side only in one case. It is found that the tip of the S 2 screw was closely located with the middle sacral vein in two cases. The tip of the S 2 pedicle screw was in contact with the sacral sympathetic trunk in eight cases on the right side and seven cases on the left side. Lateral sacral vein was also observed to be disturbed by the S 1 and S 2 screws. As a conclusion, anterior cortical penetration during sacral screw insertion carries a risk of neurovascular injury. The risk of sacral sympathetic trunk and minor vascular structures together with the major neurovascular structures and viscera should be kept in mind...|$|E

40|$|Previous work of our {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> cord in cat project heavily to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), in all likelihood conveying information from bladder and genital organs.

After wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injections into the sacral cord, anterogradely labelled fibers were found in the thalamus, specifically in the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, the medial and intralaminar nuclei, the lateral ventrobasal complex ⁄ ventroposterior lateral nucleus, and the nucleus centre me´ dian, lateral to the fasciculus retroflexus. Much denser projections were found to the central parts of the PAG, mainly to its dorsolateral and ventrolateral parts at caudal levels and lateral parts at intermediate levels. In a subsequent retrograde tracing study, injections were made in those parts of the thalamus that received sacral fibers, as found in the anterograde study. Labelled neurons were observed in the sacral cord, but not in the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> cell group. In contrast, a small control injection in the caudal PAG resulted in many labelled neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>sacral</b> cord.
