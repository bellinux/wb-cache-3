These {{variations in}} costs are found to be mainly the result of practices used in the management and feeding of the breeding herd and the fattening pigs. The average consumption of corn per hundred pounds of gain was between 434 and 457 pounds for the three groups of farms. To this was added from 38 to 56 pounds of oats, 5 to 12 pounds of tankage, 4 to 9 gallons of skimmilk besides small amounts of other concentrates. Cost of production varied with prices of feeds and other materials. In the Humboldt County study a reduction of 10 cents per bushel in corn prices, 5 cents per bushel on oats and 5 cents per hour on labor together mean a decline in the cost of hogs of just about a dollar per hundred pounds. In the Humboldt County study it was found that the costs on the breeding herd, including the feed eaten by the pigs during the suckling period, amounted to about one-third of the total costs in the production of hogs.
