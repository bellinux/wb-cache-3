5000|$|Today, {{visitors}} ride on historic converted <b>log</b> <b>cars</b> (similar to flatcars), pushed {{along by}} a powerful geared logging locomotive. Traveling on 11 mi of [...] track laid in 1901 by immigrant workers, the line traverses the steep grades of Back Allegheny Mountain.|$|R
50|$|Typically, the north-end {{operation}} has the two locomotives (running cab forward) pulling 35-45 loaded <b>log</b> <b>cars,</b> with a caboose at the end, downhill from Siding 4 to Beaver Cove. On the return trip, the locomotives {{are in the}} lead, {{but the rest of}} the train is not turned (the caboose is immediately behind the locomotive).|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, the {{operations}} of the Goodyear's lumbering company was noted as being the most extensive in the state of Pennsylvania. The mills at Austin, Galeton, and Cross Fork were the most modern in style, and included all the newest and most up-to-date machinery. The mill at Austin was listed as the largest in the state. The Goodyear's employed 2400 men, working 10 hr day. They owned 11 log loaders manufactured by the Marion Steam Shovel Co. (Goodyear owned the patent). Five shay engines moved 207 <b>log</b> <b>cars.</b> One Shay locomotive would handle two log loaders, and about 30 <b>log</b> <b>cars.</b> There were 75 mi of logging railroads, which were constantly moved around to uncut parts of the forest. These logging railroads then connected with the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. It was reported in 1898, that the Goodyear's had 10 years worth of timber left. Some of the mills operated 22 hours per day, and used electric lights to keep the men working at night.|$|R
50|$|In Cross Fork, the Lackawanna Lumber Company had 2 mills. They {{operated}} 2 standard locomotives, 2 shay locomotives, 3 log loaders, with a {{total of}} 70 <b>log</b> <b>cars.</b> Almost 20 mi of rail had been built by the Lackawanna Logging Company at Cross Fork, who also constantly moved the tracks to fresh areas to be cut. In addition, uncut logs were also brought in to Cross Fork by the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad from other nearby areas.|$|R
5000|$|By 1915, the {{railroad}} operated 35 mi of main line track, 57.8 mi of branch lines, 7.2 mi of siding, 12 locomotives, 305 <b>cars</b> (mostly Russel <b>Log</b> <b>Cars)</b> and car repair shops in Boyne City. The 1915-1916 fiscal year {{revenue for the}} B.C.G&A. was: gross earnings $263,753, net earnings $185,038, interest expense ($32,559) and net income $46,595. 86% of the revenue was from freight traffic. In 1915, the officers of the company were W.H. White, President & General Manager; Thomas White, V-P & Assistant General Manager; W.L. Martin, Secretary; J.M. Tompkins, Auditor & Purchasing Agent; all of Boyne City; James A. White, Treasurer, Buffalo, NY. The 1915 directors of the company were: William H. White, Thomas White, L.H. White, W.L. Marin, J.M. Harris, J.T. Wylie. [...] In late 1916, the B.C.G & A was stalled 9 mi from Alpena, MI at the Thunder Bay River since the company {{had run out of}} money.|$|R

5000|$|On December 20, 1918, the BCG&A reached Alpena, Michigan on Lake Huron {{where it}} intersected the Detroit and Mackinac Railway main line. The {{expanded}} BCG&A offered service to Charlevoix County, Antrim County, Otsego County, Montmorency County, and Alpena County. The BCG&A operated 90 mi of main line track, 3 branch lines had over 300 Russel <b>Log</b> <b>Cars,</b> 13 locomotives, 12 passenger cars and 1 interurban gasoline passenger car. By this time, the W.H. White Company had 4 saw mills in Boyne City {{with a combined}} capacity of [...] of lumber. In addition, the Iron & Chemical Company and the Michigan Tanning & Extract Company required {{a constant source of}} hardwood timber that the BCG&A could deliver.|$|R

50|$|The Recession of 1913-1914 {{forced the}} company to return to logging the more {{profitable}} giant sequoia. In order to accommodate such large trees the rail lines were converted from narrow(3 feet) to standard gauge(4 feet 8.5 Inches) and 50 additional <b>logging</b> <b>cars</b> were purchased. In February 1917 the company incorporated and changed its name back to the Sanger Lumber Company and later to the Sanger Lumber Company of Michigan. After the close of season on November 3, 1917 a fire destroyed the original mill at Hume and the surrounding buildings {{at a cost of}} $500,000. Much of the steel from the mill was salvaged for the war effort of World War I. The mill was replaced by a smaller mill and operated on the site into the 1920s, but after constant financial losses The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company closed in 1924. It was the last logging company to log giant sequoia.|$|R
5000|$|The Alamogordo Lumber Company was NMRy&CCo's logging {{enterprise}} and owned the logging railways, short spurs and branches, that first harvested the territory's trust {{land in the}} Sacramento Mountains. The logging lines were temporary constructions, sometimes little more than tracks laid in the dirt, and initially relied on animal labor. The A&SM carried the lumber company's logs to its sawmill in Alamogordo for processing. While the best consumers for the mill's output were the NMRy&CCo's interests, lumber was also shipped out on the EP&NE destined for other markets, especially the mining districts at Bisbee and Morenci, Arizona. Over {{the course of one}} month in 1901 the A&SM handled 850 <b>log</b> <b>cars.</b> Traffic on the A&SM line was not restricted to passengers and logs, a wide variety of other cargo was hauled including express, goods, machinery, produce, and livestock. Two daily roundtrips, one a mixed train, were common, though this frequency could increase more than twofold on Summer weekends.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the onset}} of the Great Depression and a lack of trees, the {{operation}} closed in 1931. But the graded right-of-way through the forest remained, enabling the Stauffer family to reconstruct a portion of the line in 1961. The current railroad utilizes locomotives, converted <b>log</b> disconnect <b>cars,</b> and other railroad equipment purchased from the West Side Lumber Company after it ceased railroad operations in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|Steam donkeys {{were also}} found to be useful for {{powering}} other machines such as pile drivers, slide-back loaders (also known as [...] "slide-jammers", cranes which were used to load <b>logs</b> onto railroad <b>cars</b> and which moved along the flat-bed rail cars that were to be loaded), and cherry pickers (a sled-mounted crane used for loading, onto railroad <b>cars,</b> <b>logs</b> that a grading crew had cut down). Sailing fishing vessels on the North sea operated vertical steam-driven capstans called ´the donkey´ to haul fishing lines and -nets, {{some of which are}} still operating today, even though converted to compressed air.|$|R
5000|$|On March 16, 1906, Long-Bell Company {{bought out}} two mills of the Bradley-Ramsey Lumber Company in Lake Charles. This {{included}} 105000 acre and 36 {{miles of the}} Lake Charles and Leesville railroad and was renamed the Lake Charles and Northern Railroad. This purchase included seven locomotives and 120 <b>log</b> <b>cars</b> {{and a total of}} 58.599 miles of tracks. The new rail formed part of the Atlantic System of the Southern Pacific Company. In October 1906, a new location (sections 25 and 30, township 5, of range 8 west) was cleared along the route for the Longville Long Leaf Lumber Company and town. The company built the three-story, 60-room [...] "Southern Hotel", 163 cottages for workers, a large commissary with $30,000 worth of supplies, an elementary and high school, a complete machine shop, roundhouse, car repair shop, and blacksmith shop. There was also a two story fire department building, providing around the clock service, that started with a horse-drawn wagon then a fire truck, the First National Bank, a barber shop, and the Dixie Theater.|$|R
50|$|The ski {{trails and}} lifts were given names that {{recalled}} the local history of logging; for example: Grab Hammer, J-Hook, Ball Hooter, and Skidder. Two trails, Shay's Revenge and Heisler Way, were named for brands of gear-driven steam locomotives that ferried men and logs around the mountains during the logging era. Examples of these locomotives now push tourist excursion trains (the cars themselves were once <b>logging</b> flat <b>cars)</b> on adjacent land at nearby Cass Scenic Railroad State Park.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{railroad}} {{follows a}} portion of grade originally carved into the mountain by the Madera Sugar Pine Lumber Company in the early 20th Century. The company originated in 1874, when it was organized as the California Lumber Company to log the area surrounding Oakhurst, California. [...] The Madera Sugar Pine Lumber Company once had a large sawmill at Sugar Pine, California, {{just south of the}} current YMSPRR. [...] The railroad had seven locomotives, over 100 <b>log</b> <b>cars,</b> and 140 mi of track in the surrounding mountains. [...] In addition to the railroad, the Company also transported lumber in a flume that stretched 54 mi from Sugar Pine to Madera, California. [...] This was {{the most efficient way to}} transport rough cut lumber out of the mountains for finishing and transport at the bottom of the mountain. The Madera Sugar Pine Lumber Company practiced clearcutting, which removed almost every single tree within the stands of timber surrounding the YMSPRR track. The thick forest surrounding YMSPRR today belies this history, although large stumps from the original old growth timber dot the forest floor lining the tracks.|$|R

50|$|In 1923 or 1924, a mill {{was built}} at Willow by the McGowin-Foshee Lumber Company from Alabama. The company leased 54,000 {{acres of land}} for logging. James I. Robbins, Bruce Robbins and James A. Robbins bought it in 1926. The Robbinses also bought 40,000 acres of {{woodlands}} that ran south to where State Road 70 is today. The area {{is believed to have}} included a sawmill, turpentine still, a planer mill, a dry kiln, Robbins family home, general store (known as the commissary), 75 to 80 worker houses with garden plots, a house of prostitution located on the Little Manatee River, Snowden's filling station, a post office constructed in 1889, a railroad depot with a water tower and a church, school and juke joint located in the black section of town. There was a narrow gauge railroad which had 3 engines, a service car and about 30 <b>logging</b> <b>cars</b> equipped with no brakes. At its height, as much as 50,000 board feet a day was cut. There were around 250 workers. They were paid in scrips (small round tokens) that were to be spent in the commissary and were also accepted in the house of prostitution. Willow was separated into white and black sections. The white section was the south end and the black section was the north end. The black children went to the school in Willow and the white children went to school north in the town of Wimauma.|$|R
2500|$|Large logs were {{hauled out}} to the Ilwaco dock chained down to flat <b>cars,</b> one <b>log</b> to a <b>car.</b> [...] There, they were dumped in Baker's Bay to be made into rafts for water {{transport}} to sawmills.

These are commonly left in places such as the two side bags in the front doors and the inside of the cover of the <b>car</b> <b>log</b> book.|$|R
50|$|The estate executors {{determined}} that shipping 70,000 acres of harvested timber to Bay City was not efficient. The most efficient method {{would be to}} build a modern sawmill close to the timber and upgrade the logging railroad to accommodate Class I railroad rolling stock so the finished lumber could be shipped to the large markets like Chicago.On January 1, 1901, the estate executors, Willis C. Ward, Franklin B. Ward and George K. Root, organized a corporation, under the general railroad laws of the State of Michigan, named the Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad Company, with an authorized capital stock of $525,000 to which all equipment and right-a-way property of David Ward’s Frederic & Charlevoix RR Co. were transferred. At this time, the road had three steam locomotives equipped with air brakes, 25 Russel <b>Logging</b> <b>Cars</b> and 29 platform cars rated to 60,000 lbs with air brakes, two snow plows and two passenger cars. The executors planned to improve the line to accommodate interstate railcars, rebuild the line into East Jordan, Michigan, and extend the line to Charlevoix, Michigan, 13 miles to the northwest.In winter 1901, the executors began {{the construction of a}} 600-horsepower, steam-driven, double-band sawmill plant at the site called Deward near the headwaters of the Manistee River 11 miles from Frederic, on the line of the logging railroad, and about 30 miles from East Jordan. This sawmill had an annual capacity of 20 million board feet. In addition to the sawmill, a railroad switch yard, mill pond, tramways, boarding houses, machine shops, barns, offices, school, general store, railroad station and houses were constructed. The buildings were constructed of milled lumber and tarpaper.By 1912, all 70,000 acres of the Ward estate had been clearcut and there was no more timber for the sawmill. The sawmill was dismantled and sold. The town of Deward began its return to nature.|$|R

40|$|Sustained {{advances}} in wireless communications, geopositioning, and consumer electronics {{pave the way}} to a kind of location-based service that relies on the tracking of the continuously changing positions of an entire population of service users. This type of service is characterized by large volumes of updates, giving prominence to techniques for location representation and update. This paper presents several representations, along with associated update techniques, that predict the present and future positions of moving objects. An update occurs when the deviation between the predicted and the actual position of an object exceeds a given threshold. For the case where the road network, in which an object is moving, is known, we propose a so-called segment-based policy that predicts an object’s movement according to the road’s shape. Map matching is used for determining the road on which an object is moving. Empirical performance studies based on a real road network and GPS <b>logs</b> from <b>cars</b> are reported. 1...|$|R
