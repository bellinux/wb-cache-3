5000|$|In 2007 a major {{revision}} {{was needed}} and Exit published Five <b>Last</b> <b>Acts,</b> a larger book (187 pages) that detailed {{the use of}} helium and four other main methods of rational suicide, {{most of which were}} not covered in Departing Drugs. A similar methodology was used, examining the science behind its assertions. The Five <b>Last</b> <b>Acts</b> series is distinguished by footnotes and citations to evidence. Although the first edition was made available only to members of Exit and other right-to-die societies under strict conditions, such distribution methods were augmented in subsequent editions by placing these more substantial books on general release. Five <b>Last</b> <b>Acts</b> II followed in 2010, [...] and Five <b>Last</b> <b>Acts</b> - The Exit Path in 2013. A major update to the latter was released in May 2015 after concerns had been raised over helium balloon gas being diluted with air by some manufacturers. Exit then published the world's first guide to using welding gas nitrogen as an alternative.|$|R

The wife of the play's tragic hero, Macbeth (a Scottish nobleman), Lady Macbeth goads her husband into committing regicide, after which she becomes queen of Scotland. Later, however, she suffers pangs of guilt for her part in the crime, which drives her to sleepwalk. She dies off-stage in the <b>last</b> <b>act,</b> an apparent suicide.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Lee's United States {{citizenship}} was posthumously {{restored in}} 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well. This was accomplished {{with the passing}} of Senate Joint Resolution 16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter referred to this as the <b>last</b> <b>act</b> of reconciliation in the Civil War.|$|E

He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976. After returning to the US, he resumed his work at Covington & Burling. In his <b>last</b> <b>act</b> of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, had refused to confirm new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops. Despite this, Alexander's <b>last</b> <b>act</b> as pope before he died was to condemn the Declaration of the Clergy of France on 1 February 1691.|$|E

5|$|The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The <b>last</b> <b>act</b> was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
5|$|Arya {{once again}} returns {{to watch the}} play {{featuring}} Lady Crane. She sneaks backstage during the <b>last</b> <b>act</b> and poisons Lady Crane's rum.

Back in the dressing room, Arya stops Lady Crane from drinking her rum, and warns her that her rival Bianca wants her dead. The scene is witnessed by the Waif, who returns to tell Jaqen H'ghar of Arya's failure. Jaqen gives the Waif permission to kill Arya, {{on the condition that}} Arya doesn't suffer.

5|$|At {{the end of}} his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby {{retired from}} public life but he was called back into {{politics}} by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War.

5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his <b>last</b> <b>act.</b> Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt {{was raised}} from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008–2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 {{and he was}} succeeded {{for the last time}} by Sir David Richards. The {{government}} took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His <b>last</b> <b>act</b> as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E
5|$|In his <b>last</b> <b>act</b> {{of public}} service, in 1839 Rowan was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an adjournment {{of the commission}} in 1842, Rowan returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. Rowan died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, Rowan specified that no marker should be placed over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored above his parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, the marker frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of Rowan haunting his grave.|$|E

5|$|John Smith became {{chairman}} in 1973 with his business experience {{to build a}} more corporate view for the club. He ended the club's policy of changing chairmen every three years. In 1973 the old Main Stand was demolished and replaced with official opening by the Duke of Kent on 10March 1973. They exited to Yugoslav team Red Star Belgrade in the 1973–74 European Cup second round. Their 1973-74 Football League campaign was bookended with poor results (in contrast to champions Leeds United unbeaten in their first league 29 games). Liverpool finished second. A second FA Cup win came with two goals by Keegan and one by Heighway in the 1974 FA Cup Final beating Newcastle United 3–0. Ray Kennedy's end of season transfer from Arsenal was Shankly's <b>last</b> <b>act</b> as Liverpool manager. He resigned citing {{the need for a}} break and was replaced by his assistant Bob Paisley.|$|E
5|$|Kashyap {{found his}} {{production}} company Anurag Kashyap Films in 2009, which is managed by Guneet Monga.

5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the <b>last</b> <b>act</b> of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
