50|$|In a {{quest to}} gain {{eligibility}} for the 2016 Summer Olympics Williams began her clay season in Brindisi in a Fed Cup World Group Play-off tie against Italy. The American was nominated to play Camila Giorgi in her first rubber and edged out the first set in a tiebreak. Williams broke serve {{for the first time}} in the fourth game and wrapped up the match with a second break as the Italian was serving to stay in the match. The tie was locked at 1-1 at the end of day 1 after Williams' teammate Lauren Davis managed to win only three games in her rubber. Williams played Italian No. 1 Sara Errani in her second single rubber and lost just her second set in eight meetings against the Italian. The American's fluctuating level saw her go from a break up to a break down with the Italian serving for the match. The American broke serve and won the set in a tiebreak to level the match. Williams took the third set and ended the match with 70 winners to Errani's 7. With this win team USA led 2-1 and needed one more point to advance back into the World Group. The tie was forced in to a deciding doubles rubber when Christina McHale managed just two games in her loss to Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta. Williams teamed up with Alison Riske, marking the first time she had played doubles with anyone other than her sister Venus in 13 years, to take on Eranni and Pennetta. The Italian pairing handed Williams her first Fed Cup <b>loss</b> <b>en</b> <b>route</b> to winning the final rubber and clinching the tie 3-2. USA were relegated to World Group II.|$|E

Perhaps the most important development for the second season of football was Smyers recruitment of Joseph Trees from Normal University of Pennsylvania. The 210 pound Trees became WUP's first subsidized athlete and, later in life, made millions in the oil industry and became an important benefactor for the university and athletic department. Today, Trees Hall, an athletic facility on the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh, bears his name.|$|R

The early pioneer successes of the teams Maitland and Heggenberger and Smith and Bronte in crossing the Pacific inspired James Dole to sponsor his Pineapple Derby race in August 1927. Dole, head of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, had offered a prize of $25,000 to the first flyer {{in the race to}} cross the Pacific and reach Honolulu, Hawaii, from the continental U.S. The Pineapple Derby attracted eight entries, but only four aircraft actually left for Hawaii. A Lockheed Vega named Golden Eagle, sponsored by John Randolph Hearst, Jr., and a Buhl biplane named Miss Doran never arrived and were presumed lost at sea. Art Goebel’s Woolaroc Travel Air 5000 monoplane was the winner of the race. Goebel arrived overdue at Wheeler Field on the 17th, followed a few hours later by the only other plane to complete the race, Aloha, a Breese monoplane piloted by Martin Jensen and Paul Schluter.

Also, landing at Ormoc 9 November 1944 occurred amidst the Battle of Ormoc Bay, therefore transport ships were forced to leave early, before unloading all of the equipment and supplies - only to be sunk while on return route. Many of later supply and reinforcement vessels were also sunk. The 26th Division attacked US positions in the Battle of Shoestring Ridge 28 November 1944, resulting in tactical stalemate until 5 December 1944, when Japanese forces were withdrawn to between Palanas river and Tabgas River in Albuera, where the Japanese defences held for few more days. On 6 December 1944, one battalion of the 26th Division participated in the Battle of the Airfields together with the remnants of the 16th Division but after some initial successes was defeated 9 December 1944. The 26th Division was largely annihilated during the Battle of Leyte by 23 December 1944 and all contact with the central command was lost until early March, 1945.

In the early 20th century, ammunition designers developed [...] "spotlight" [...] bullets, which would create a flash or smoke puff on impact to increase their visibility.

40|$|International audienceSiberia {{with its}} large area covered with boreal forests, {{wetlands}} and tundra {{is believed to}} be an important sink for ozone via dry deposition and reactions with biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by the forests. To study the importance of deposition of ozone in Siberia, we analyse measurements of ozone mixing ratios taken along the Trans-Siberian railway by train, air-borne measurements andpoint measurements at the Zotino station. For all data, we ran the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART in backward mode for 20 d, which yields the so-called potential emission sensitivity (PES) fields. These fields give a quantitative measure of where andhow strongly the sampledair masses have been in contact with the surface and hence possible influenced by surface fluxes. These fields are further statistically analysed to identify source andsink regions that are influencing the observedozone. Results show that the source regions for the surface ozone in Siberia are located at lower latitudes: the regions around the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, Kazakhstan andChina. Low ozone mixing ratios are associated to transport from North West Russia, the Arctic region, andthe Pacific Ocean. By calculating PES values for both a passive tracer without consideration of removal processes and for an ozone-like tracer where dry deposition processes are included, we are able to quantify the ozone <b>loss</b> occurring <b>en</b> <b>route</b> to the receptor. Strong correlations between low ozone concentrations andthe spatially integratedfootprints from FLEXPART, especially during the period summer to autumn, indicate the importance of the Siberian forests as a sink for tropospheric ozone...|$|R
