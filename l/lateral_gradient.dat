The salinity gradient was displayed in an ordination of the assemblages by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). However, salinity was {{not found to be}} a significant environmental factor to explain the distribution of the assemblages. Conversely, a <b>lateral</b> <b>gradient</b> characterized three clusters of sites identified in relation to their outer, intermediate and inner location also related to organic matter content, oxygen concentration and redox potential values. Although the hydrodynamic factor was not investigated it is thought to be an important environmental factor for characterizing the <b>lateral</b> <b>gradient.</b> As a general trend, there was a transition between the groups of assemblages from the lower estuary towards the inner and upstream locations. The polychaetes Lanice conchilega and Hediste diversicolor and the gastropod Hydrobia ulvae were the characteristic species in the outer, inner and intermediate groups of sites, respectively. It was concluded that the <b>lateral</b> <b>gradient</b> is the main environmental driver that explains the distribution of the intertidal macrobenthic assemblages in the Tagus estuary when the salinity gradient is not find to be a significant environmental factor...|$|E

40|$|The restratification of the oceanic surface {{mixed layer}} {{that results from}} <b>lateral</b> <b>gradients</b> in the surface density field is studied. The <b>lateral</b> <b>gradients</b> are shown to be {{unstable}} to ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and slump from the horizontal to the vertical. These instabilities, which {{are referred to as}} mixed layer instabilities (MLIs), differ from instabilities in the ocean interior because of the weak surface stratification. Spatial scales are O(1 – 10) km, and growth time scales are on the order of a day. Linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear simulations are used to study MLIs and their impact on mixed layer restratification. The main result is that MLIs are a leading-order process in the ML heat budget acting to constantly restratify the surface ocean. Climate and regional ocean models do not resolve the scales associated with MLIs and are likely to underestimate the rate of ML restratification and consequently suffer from a bias in sea surface temperatures and ML depths. In a forthcoming paper, the authors discuss a parameterization scheme to include the effect of MLIs in ocean models. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} species {{distribution}} {{patterns of the}} riparian flora along four Mediterranean rivers at regional and local level, {{in order to determine}} the most important gradients and to clarify the role played by biogeography. Floristic data were ordinated to identify the main floristic gradients, with or besides the geographical position of the rivers. Variance partitioning was performed to quantify the relative contributions of variable subsets (biogeography, longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>gradient)</b> to the explained variation, and to test whether and to what extent the influence of biogeography could be distinguished from the effects of other environmental variables. The regional differentiation always emerged as the main variables affecting the distribution of the riverbed floras, thus confirming the primary role of geography in driving riparian plant species distribution at the regional scale comparing insular and continental rivers. After removing the “river effect”, the main gradient at the regional level was the structural transition from mountain to lowland areas, following the longitudinal gradient and the increasing human disturbance. At the local level, longitudinal and lateral gradients were the most important for riparian vegetation. Despite the high value of unexplained variance, variance partitioning revealed that the longitudinal gradient strongly affected riverbed flora patterns, followed by biogeography, while the <b>lateral</b> <b>gradient,</b> determinant at the local scale, had a weak effect at the regional scale.

40|$|The {{scaling of}} CMOS {{technology}} has progressed rapidly for three decades, {{contributing to the}} superior performance and dramatically reduced cost per function for modern integrated circuits. As the CMOS dimension, in particular, the channel length approaches the nanometer regime (< 100 nm), however, static power dissipation increases precipitously due to increasing leakage currents arising from quantum mechanical tunneling and electron thermal energy. To extend CMOS scaling to 10 nm while still gaining significant performance benefit, alternative device structures or materials are being studied extensively. This work considers the device design and technology requirements of scaling bulk MOSFET to the ultimate limit of 10 nm. For control of short channel effects, the 2 -D scale length theory provides a guideline for CMOS device design. A scale length of less than 7 nm is required for 10 -nm MOSFET with acceptable short channel effect. High-K dielectric is needed to replace silicon dioxide so that an effective oxide thickness of 0. 4 nm can be obtained without inducing detrimental gate tunneling leakage. High body doping level of above 10 ¹⁹ cm⁻³ is required to control the depletion width to 5 nm. Metal gate {{would be needed to}} replace polysilicon gate to avoid poly-depletion effect.

It measures ß+-activity distributions generated via nuclear fragmentation reactions within the target volume. BASTEI has about 4 million coincidence channels. The emission data are acquired in a 3 D regime and stored in a list mode data format. Typically counting statstics is two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of typical PET-scans in nuclear medicine. Two iterative 3 D reconstruction algorithms based on ISRA (Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm) and MLEM (Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization), respectively, have been adapted to this imaging geometry. The major advantage of the developed approaches are run-time Monte-Carlo simulations which are used to calculate the transition matrix. The influences of detector sensitivity variations, randoms, activity from outside of the field of view and attenuation are corrected for the individual coincidence channels.

Because 230 Th and 231 Pa are produced uniformly from uranium decay and removed differentially by scavenging, the process of boundary scavenging can be elucidated by a more detailed knowledge of their water column distributions. To this end, filtered seawater was collected across the gradients in particle flux which span the subarctic Pacific: in the west during the Innovative North Pacific Experiment (INOPEX) and in the east along Line P. <b>Lateral</b> concentration <b>gradients</b> of dissolved 230 Th are small throughout the subarctic Pacific at 12 sites of variable particle flux.

Lateral displacement variation towards tips was analysed by measuring displacement gradients from systematic positions along the fault trace. <b>Lateral</b> displacement <b>gradients</b> measured for 39 tips exhibit a wide range of values (0. 016 - 0. 25).
