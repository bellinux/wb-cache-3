25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>evils</b> when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E

The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, which stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. An action group was established. Hallgeir Matre stated that Stord had a lack of beaches and that the two islands [...] "were the last low, forested islands in the area after the paradise Eldøyane had been converted to an industrial area for Aker Stord during the 1970s".

Through the assistance of his brother and the prefect of Grenoble Joseph Fourier, who was also an egyptologist, he successfully avoided the draft by arguing that his work on deciphering the Egyptian script was too important to interrupt. First skeptical of the Napoleonic regime, {{after the fall of}} Napoleon in 1813 and the institution of the royalist regime under Louis XVIII, Champollion came to consider the Napoleonic state the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>evils.</b> Anonymously he composed and circulated songs ridiculing and criticizing the royal regime [...] songs that became highly popular among the people of Grenoble. In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from his exile on Elba and landed with an army at the Côte d'Azur and marched directly on Grenoble where he was received as a liberator. Here he met with Champollion, whose many requests for exemption from the draft he remembered, and he asked him how his important work was progressing. Champollion replied, that he had just finished his Coptic grammar and dictionary. Napoleon requested that he send the manuscripts to Paris for publication. His brother Jacques joined the Napoleonic cause, putting both of the brothers in danger {{at the end of the}} Hundred Days when Napoleon was finally defeated, Grenoble being the last city to resist the royalist advances. In spite of the risk to themselves, having been put under Royalist surveillance, the Champollion brothers nonetheless aided the Napoleonic general Drouet d'Erlon who had been sentenced to death for his participation in the Battle of Waterloo, giving him shelter and helping him escape to Munich. The brothers were condemned to internal exile in Figeac, and Champollion was removed from his university post in Grenoble and the faculty closed.|$|E

His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>evils</b> to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{occupational}} choice in which private agents {{have the option of}} either working in some costless, but low-yielding, activity (subsistence production), or undertaking a costly, but potentially more rewarding, venture (entrepreneurship). In the case of the latter, loans must be acquired from ?nancial intermediaries and licenses must be obtained from public officials.

Rent-seeking is risky because of a random probability that it will be detected and punished. Against this background, we show how corruption has di¤erent effects depending on the way that it is practised: in the case of disorganised corruption, bribe payments are uncertain and capital market imperfections are allowed to surface; in the case of organised corruption both of these features are removed. The implication is that, in terms of deterring entrepreneurial activity, organised corruption {{is likely to be the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>evils,</b> even if bribe demands are higher in this case. This result may be used to explain the puzzle of why corruption appears to be much less damaging in some countries than in others. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{applications}} deploy multiple threads to {{take advantage}} of the manycore processors. However, many recent studies have shown that neither applications 2 ̆ 7 execution time nor energy consumption consistently reaps the expected benefits from multi-thread execution on manycore processors. This dissertation investigates the scalability of multi-threaded Java applications and parallel I/Os, and seeks to design and implement multiple thread schedulers to improve both performance and energy consumption of manycore processor systems. ^ As the first example, garbage collection of the multi-threaded Java applications unexpectedly takes longer with more CPUs. This behavior not only prolongs the execution time but also incurs higher energy consumption. We discover that parallelism’s ability to improve scalability can also hinder performance by introducing more competition for limited heap resources. Our study shows that Completely Fair Scheduler is responsible for increased competition among the threads. If the threads are instead scheduled in a first-in-first-out order, the scalability of both the garbage collector and applications can be significantly improved. ^ Based on this observation, we propose three approaches to optimally selecting scheduling policies. Our first approach uses the profile information collected from one execution to fine-tune subsequent executions. Our second approach, ARES, dynamically collects information and performs on-the-fly policy selection during execution. Our third approach, PASS, identifies execution phases with parallelism during execution and selects a different scheduler for those periods accordingly. ^ As the second example, NUMA-based NVMe devices use multiple I/O threads to achieve higher throughput and shorter latency. However, the access penalty of an NVMe SSD attached to a remote CPU affects both the scalability of multi-I/O-threaded applications and the energy consumption of the CPU. Our comprehensive study shows that the penalty resulting from CPU contention is much smaller than that of accessing remote NVMe SSDs in a NUMA system. Based on this insight, we develop a performance-energy algorithm to select 2 ̆ 2 the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>evil</b> 2 ̆ 2. The proposed algorithm, ESN, is an energy-efficient profiling-based I/O threads scheduler to manage I/O threads accessing NVMe SSDs on NUMA systems.

5000|$|In Morris v Murray (1990) 3 AER 801 the {{claimant}} helped an obviously drunken pilot {{get into a}} small aeroplane, which crashed as it attempted to take off. This was a classic case for volenti to apply. The court held that {{the claimant}} must have known the condition of the pilot and voluntarily took the risk of negligence by agreeing to be a passenger. However, in driving cases, s149 Road Traffic Act 1988 denies the effectiveness of any agreement between a passenger of a motor vehicle and the driver that seeks to exclude liability for negligence where insurance cover for passengers is compulsory. This applies both to express agreements between driver and passenger (e.g. where the driver displays a notice in the vehicle stating that passengers travel at their own risk) and to implied agreements in cases such as Pitts v Hunt (1991) 1 QB 24, where the claimant was a passenger on a motor cycle knowing that the driver was drunk, uninsured, and without a current licence. The defendant negligently collided with another vehicle, killing himself and injuring the passenger. Dillon LJ. dismissed the claim on the ground of ex turpi causa because there was a joint common purpose. This is a public policy test of [...] "public conscience" [...] because the claimant might otherwise benefit from the unlawful behaviour willingly undertaken. Similarly, under ss1 and 2 Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, commercial agreements seeking to exclude liability in negligence are also void. But if the claimant signs an express agreement identifying the nature of the risks likely to be run and accepting those risks, this is evidence that the claimant is volens and has chosen to run the risk not by compulsion or as the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> or more <b>evils</b> i.e. the contractual clause is an express volenti exclusion clause for the purposes of tortious liability. Because knowledge of a risk does not of itself imply consent, the UCTA prevails and such clauses do not automatically exclude liability. This would particularly apply in medical cases where informed consent is traditionally evidenced in a written form (Luckham: 2004).|$|R
