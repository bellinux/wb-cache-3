With this method, it is possible to detect a wider range of pitch accent errors than with previous methods and it is possible to have more flexibility in displaying the pitch pattern to the learner. This rule-based method is based on perceptual experiments in which we made use of speech synthesis to ma-nipulate the pitch of utterances to perform quantitative analysis on accent perception. The recognition is based on two-mora units and the local pitch level pattern <b>for</b> those <b>units.</b> By com-bining the local pitch level patterns for a word it is possible to derive the two level pitch pattern for the word and also provide a variety of ways to display the word to the language learner. The average agreement rate with the <b>labeling</b> <b>for</b> these <b>units</b> was 75 % {{in the case of the}} Japanese database and 66 % in the case of the non-Japanese database...|$|R

We show {{that one can}} assign each vertex of an n-vertex UDG G acompactO(log 2 n) -bit label such that, given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, {{it is possible to}} compute efficiently, based solely on these two labels, a neighbor of the source vertex that heads {{in the direction of the}} destination. We prove that this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay), i. e., for each two vertices x and y of G, it produces a routing path with h(x, y) hops (edges) such that h(x, y) ≤ 3 ·dG(x, y) + 12, where dG(x, y) is the hop distance between x and y in G. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay and polylog label size. Furthermore, our routing labeling scheme has a constant length route-stretch. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} recent deep {{convolutional}} neural networks (CNNs) depends on learning hidden representations that can summarize the important factors of variation behind the data. However, CNNs often criticized as being black boxes that lack interpretability, {{since they have}} millions of unexplained model parameters. In this work, we describe Network Dissection, a method that interprets networks by providing <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> the <b>units</b> of their deep visual representations. The proposed method quantifies the interpretability of CNN representations by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units {{and a set of}} visual semantic concepts. By identifying the best alignments, units are given human interpretable labels across a range of objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. The method reveals that deep representations are more transparent and interpretable than expected: we find that representations are significantly more interpretable than they would be under a random equivalently powerful basis. We apply the method to interpret and compare the latent representations of various network architectures trained to solve different supervised and self-supervised training tasks. We then examine factors affecting the network interpretability such as the number of the training iterations, regularizations, different initializations, and the network depth and width. Finally we show that the interpreted units can be used to provide explicit explanations of a prediction given by a CNN for an image. Our results highlight that interpretability is an important property of deep neural networks that provides new insights into their hierarchical structure. Comment: *B. Zhou and D.

We prove that this routing labeling scheme has a constant hop route-stretch (= hop delay), i. e., for each two vertices x and y of G, it produces a routing path with h(x,y) hops (edges) such that h(x,y) ⩽ 3 ⋅dG(x,y) + 12, where dG(x,y) is the hop distance between x and y in G. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compact routing scheme for UDGs which not only guaranties delivery but has a low hop delay. Furthermore, our routing labeling scheme has a constant length route-stretch and a constant power route-stretch. To obtain this result, we establish a novel balanced separator theorem for UDGs, which mimics the well-known Lipton and Tarjanʼs planar balanced shortest paths separator theorem. We prove that, in any n-vertex UDG G, one can find two hop-shortest paths P(s,x) and P(s,y) such that the removal of the 3 -hop-neighborhood of these paths (i. e., NG 3 [P(s,x) ∪P(s,y) ]) from G leaves no connected component with more than 2 / 3 n vertices. This new balanced shortest-paths– 3 -hop-neighborhood separator theorem allows us to build, for any n-vertex UDG G, a system T(G) of at most 2 log 32 n+ 2 spanning trees of G such that, for any two vertices x and y of G, there exists a tree T in T(G) with dT(x,y) ⩽ 3 ⋅dG(x,y) + 12. That is, the distances in any UDG can be approximately represented by the distances in at most 2 log 32 n+ 2 of its spanning trees...|$|R
