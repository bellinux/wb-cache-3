50|$|A doorjamb, {{door jamb}} (also {{sometimes}} doorpost) is the vertical {{portion of the}} door frame onto which a door is secured. The jamb bears {{the weight of the}} door through its hinges, and most types of door <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> <b>deadbolts</b> extend into a recess in the doorjamb when engaged, making the accuracy of the plumb (i.e. true vertical) and strength of the doorjambs vitally important to the overall operational durability and security of the door.|$|R
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity.
