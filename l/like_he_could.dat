25|$|During {{the first}} steel cage match rivals Trauma I and Canis Lups {{were the first}} two out of the cage, making Lucha de Apuestas {{challenges}} towards each other afterwards, both wanting the other to put their mask on the line. Mr. Águila clipped Danny Casas' knees and then {{climbed out of the}} cage, forcing Casas to wrestle later in the night. Mr. Elektro and El Hijo de Dos Caras were the first two wrestlers to escape the second cage match, leaving Toscano and Máscara Año 2000 Jr. in the cage. Máscara Año 2000 Jr. looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not continue wrestling and actually told Toscano to just climb out of the cage. Insead Toscano landed a low blow foul on Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and lost the match by disqualification. Toscano stated he did it to get revenge on Danny Casas for taking his hair almost six months prior. In the main event Toscano took advantage of Casas being hurt in the previous match and quickly defeated him. As a result of the match Casas had his hair shaved off moments before he was taken from the ring on a stretcher.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead and who should follow. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo 2000. When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerrera de Titanes 2000, the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. On June 30, 2001 Cibernético's almost three-year-long reign as Campeon de Campeones was ended when Heavy Metal won the title from him. Cibernético regained the title less than two months later, becoming the only three time Campeon de Campeones {{in the history of the}} title. Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly stopped promoting the belt some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes. On January 20, 2002 Cibernético finally managed to defeat his longtime rival El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he would retain for almost 10 months before El Canek regained the title on November 15, 2002.|$|E

The New York Times commented that Perot's [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to do it just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|E
500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's... Todd was cool and he was a producer." [...] Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: [...] "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> handle the pace." [...] Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that [...] "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York".|$|E

Verne Gay of Newsday noted that this episode of 30 Rock was a [...] "spectacular piece of television, and comedy writing, and acting". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun called Tracy's plot [...] "very believable", and opined that [...] "any reservations I have had about this show being less than completely real are gone" [...] after watching this episode. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times deemed this a stellar episode, explaining that the Tracy, Liz, and Jack characters had storylines that allowed them [...] "to strut their comedic stuff". Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] {{was a very good}} episode. He noted that Jack's storyline was the [...] "simplest recipe for comedy: just turn on a camera and let Alec Baldwin be hilarious.

500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans.

(Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships."

He recalled being familiar with many of Macedonski's original theories on various subjects, including astronomy and the works of Camille Flammarion.

He also recorded that the theistic Macedonski answered [...] "positive science" [...] with [...] "the grin of skepticism". Nevertheless, according to Tradem, Alexandru Macedonski flirted with Naturalism during the early part of his career, and admired the works of Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola. His memoirs also provided detail on Macedonski's interest in visual arts, indicating that the older poet had always wished to become a painter, and that his determination had instead shaped the artistic career of his son Alexis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to quite possibly outnumbering {{the force of}} the Shah, and definitely possessing more horsemen in total and more men at almost every battle, the Mongols were benefited enormously by the fragility of the Khwarezmian empire. While often portrayed as a strong and unified state, most of the Shah's holdings were recent conquests only nominally sworn to him, {{to the point that the}} Shah didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust most of his troops. In the words of historian C.E. Bosworth: [...] " [...] highly unpopular and a focus for popular hatred; in none of the provinces they ruled did the Khwarazm Shahs ever succeed in creating a bond of interest between themselves and their subjects." [...] This resulted in him parsing them in garrisons to be commanded by local governors that acted more or less autonomously. There was no attempt to coordinate a grand strategy among the various provinces or unite a significant number of forces in one unified front against the invaders. Additionally, many of the areas that Muhammad charged his troops to defend had been devastated recently by the forces of the Shah himself. For example, in 1220 he passed through Nishapur and urged the citizens to repair the fortifications he had destroyed when conquering the city years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Sam Strike plays Jackson, born Jedidiah Sawyer, {{as one of}} {{the four}} inmates that escape the mental institution, before {{ultimately}} becoming the eponymous Leatherface after enduring tragedies that destroy his cognitive stability. Leatherface is a mentally disabled serial killer seen throughout the TCM franchise, known for wearing masks made of human skin, and using a chainsaw and mallet as his signature weapons. Strike joined the film after reading the script, which he opined was, for a horror film, very character-driven. He felt that there needed to be a contrast between {{the two sides of the}} character, to show how a somewhat kind person can become such a killer: [...] "It could happen to anybody. He had it in him because of his mother, but was at the mercy of his environment." [...] Strike integrated aspects from the original film into his performance out of respect, but wanted to give his own interpretation instead of imitating what came before. To make the character's transformation more believable, Strike intentionally tried to gain physical body weight before filming: [...] "I was trying to eat as much as I could to just feel physically capable. Chainsaws, in reality, are very heavy, especially ones that are manufactured back in the '50s and '60s. Leatherface looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take your head off with a slap; I wanted to be able to feel that way." [...] Strike believed that the character's bursts of rage throughout the film contributed to his final permanent state as a monster. He developed a [...] "battle cry" [...] for whenever Leatherface lost his temper. As someone who was taken from his biological family and put into foster care at an early age, Jedidiah Sawyer was written in the screenplay to have been adopted at one point by a family that wanted a little girl, forcing him to wear drag clothing as a child and foreshadowing his gender ambiguity in the 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This plot point was absent from the final cut of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while.
