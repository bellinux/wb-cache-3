25|$|Air Berlin <b>long-haul</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{featured}} {{business and}} economy class sections. At {{the beginning of}} 2012, Air Berlin started the renewal of its long-haul cabin, equipping both economy class and business class with new seats and a new in-flight entertainment system. Fully automatic seats that could tilt up to 170 degrees were provided in business class, along with an anti-thrombosis edition and an adjustable headrest, and more legroom and a narrower seat back in economy class. All seats have an 8.9-inch monitor with a touch screen and offer movies, series, music, audio books and games. In January 2013 the airline again presented a new business class which replaced the one introduced a year earlier. The new business class had single seats, offering travellers even more privacy. The new seats had a full-flat function, a massage function, and featured a 15-inch monitor.|$|E

25|$|Following another federal repayable funding {{commitment}} of one billion francs, {{each of the}} 26 <b>long-haul</b> <b>aircraft</b> (MD-11s and A330s) and 26 medium-haul aircraft (A321s, A320s and A319s) were able {{to be transferred to}} Crossair / Swiss {{at the end of the}} winter schedule of 2001/02. On Easter Monday, 1 April 2002, the last flight of Swissair, flight SR145 from São Paulo, landed in Zurich. A 71-year-long chapter of Swiss aviation history thus came to an end. Between 1931 and 2002, Swissair had transported more than 260 million passengers. The SwissairGroup (the name change from SAirGroup to SwissairGroup was announced in 2001 but never officially implemented) still existed as 'SAirGroup in Nachlassstundung' (German: Swissair in Administration) for several years until all assets were liquidated, including a large auction where many of the remaining Swissair assets, such as historic items, were auctioned. Today, Gategourmet continues as a subsidiary under the parent firm Gate Group.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{expanded}} operations {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean when regular charter service to New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport {{was started in}} June 2004. Permission was granted to the airline to convert this to regular scheduled service by the Israeli government and the FAA on May 1, 2006. This service was discontinued in September 2008, due to escalating fuel prices and the expectation of {{a drop in the}} number of passengers due to the weakness of the dollar at the time. After Israir was granted permission to operate scheduled the service on the lucrative New York-Tel Aviv route, it also entered talks with both Boeing and Airbus regarding the acquisition of new aircraft to its fleet and replacement of its existing jets. The company was said to be in talks with Airbus over the A350 model. It also signed a deal to acquire Airbus A320 aircraft. This was a significant milestone in Israeli aviation, as no airline had ever before purchased Airbus aircraft. In April 2008, the airline received an Airbus A330 for its New York flights to replace the Boeing 767 aircraft it had previously been wet-leasing. Israir however meanwhile no longer flies to New York and has since phased out all <b>long-haul</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40) was a Luftwaffe {{medium and}} heavy bomber wing of World War II, {{and the primary}} {{maritime}} patrol unit of any size within the World War II Luftwaffe. It is best remembered as the unit operating {{a majority of the}} four-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor maritime patrol bombers. The unit suffered from the poor serviceability and low production rates of the Fw 200 bombers, and from repeated diversion of its <b>long-haul</b> capability <b>aircraft</b> to undertake transport duties in various theatres, especially for the airlift operations to supply encircled forces in the Battle of Stalingrad. Later in the war, KG 40 became one of several Luftwaffe bomber wings to use the Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|R

50|$|The airport has {{a single}} runway {{designated}} 02/20, with a length of 2895 by 60 m, making it longer and wider than those at many other airports in Northern England. This stems from the airport's history as a former long-range nuclear bomber base (RAF Finningley), and makes the airport suitable for wide-bodied, <b>long-haul</b> or cargo-carrying <b>aircraft.</b> The runway is long enough that the airport was designated a Space Shuttle emergency landing site. There is significant room at the airport for further passenger and cargo capacity expansion in the future. As it stands, terminal capacity is around 2.5 million passengers annually.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a vehicle synthesis program, called TRANSYN, designed to perform automated preliminary design of <b>long-haul</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> is briefly described. The TRANSYN-TST program was used {{in a study of}} commercial transonic transports designed for introduction in the early 1980 s. The optimum engine cycles of all the study aircraft are within the current state-of-the-art, but fan noise suppression will be required to meet the noise requirements of FAR Part 36. It was found that full use of advanced composite materials in the wing and fuselage structure is neutrally cost effective when compared with aluminum for aircraft designed to cruise in the low transonic regime (Mach 0. 90 to 1. 0), but that such materials are very cost effective for aircraft designed to cruise in the high transonic regime (Mach 1. 0 to 1. 15). Finally, increasing speed results in reduced trip times with at most very slight increases in cost in the low transonic regime, but cruise speeds in the high transonic regime result in a significant economic penalty for the conventional configurations considered in this study...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone by AIRBUS In-Service Aircraft) {{successor}} programme IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) {{started to}} equip their <b>long-haul</b> passenger <b>aircraft</b> with the modified capacitive hygrometer Vaisala HUMICAP® of type H. The assurance {{of the data}} quality and {{the consistency of the}} data set during the transition from MOZAIC Capacitive Hygrometers to IAGOS Capacitive Hygrometers were evaluated within the CIRRUS-III and AIRTOSS-ICE field studies. During these performance tests, the capacitive hygrometers were operated aboard a Learjet 35 A aircraft together with a closed-cell Lyman-α fluorescence hygrometer, an open-path tunable diode laser (TDL) system and a closed-cell, direct TDL absorption hygrometer for water vapour measurement. For MOZAIC-typical operation conditions, the comparison of relative humidity (RH) data from the capacitive hygrometers and reference instruments yielded remarkably good agreement with an uncertainty of 5 % RH. The temperature dependence of the sensor’s response time was derived from the cross-correlation of capacitive hygrometer data and smoothed data from the fast-responding reference instruments. The resulting exponential moving average function could explain the major part of the observed deviations between the capacitive hygrometers and the reference instruments...|$|R

40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that, with sufficient technology development, future high-speed civil transport aircraft could be economically competitive with <b>long-haul</b> subsonic <b>aircraft.</b> However, uncertainty about atmospheric pollution, along with community noise and sonic boom, {{continues to be}} a major concern which is being addressed in the planned six-year High-Speed Research Program begun in 1990. Building on NASA's research in atmospheric science and emissions reduction, current analytical predictions indicate that an operating range may exist at altitudes below 20 km (i. e., corresponding to a cruise Mach number of approximately 2. 4) where the goal level of 5 gm equivalent NO 2 emissions/kg fuel will deplete {{less than one percent of}} column ozone. Because it will not be possible to directly measure the impact of an aircraft fleet on the atmosphere, the only means of assessment will be prediction. The process of establishing credibility for the predicted effects will likely be complex and involve continued model development and testing against climatological patterns. In particular, laboratory simulation of heterogeneous chemistry and other effects, and direct measurements of well understood tracers in the troposphere and stratosphere are being used to improve the current models...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{sponsored by}} NASA indicates that air transportation {{can play an}} important role in the economic progress of developing countries. By the turn of the century, the rapid economic growth now occurring in many developing countries should result in a major redistribution of the world's income. Some countries now classified as 'developing' will become 'developed' and are likely to become far more important to the world's civil aviation industry. Developing countries will be increasingly important buyers of conventional subsonic <b>long-haul</b> jet passenger <b>aircraft</b> but not to the point of significant influence on the design or technological content of future aircraft of this type. However, the technological content of more specialized aircraft may be influenced by developing country requirements and reflected in designs which fill a need concerning specialized missions, related to short-haul, low-density, rough runways, and natural resource development...|$|R
