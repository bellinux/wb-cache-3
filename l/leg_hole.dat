50|$|There is {{a village}} green on {{which are the}} stocks that were used for {{punishing}} petty offenders. It is claimed that these were especially built for a one-legged ex-soldier and his two drinking companions as there are only five <b>leg</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{baby walker}} is {{a device that}} can be used by infants who cannot walk on their own to move from one place to another. Modern baby walkers have a base made of hard plastic sitting on top of wheels and a {{suspended}} fabric seat with two <b>leg</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The village stocks can {{be viewed}} by the A338 roadside. They were {{originally}} at the road junction, but are now opposite the Bat and Ball Hotel. They were restored after being badly damaged by a lorry. The stocks have a whipping post and horizontals with four <b>leg</b> <b>holes.</b> A modern roof has been erected over them.|$|R
50|$|A baby jumper is {{a device}} {{that can be used}} by infants to {{exercise}} and play in. The original baby jumper consists of a hoop suspended by an elastic strap. More elaborate baby jumbers have a base made of hard plastic sitting in a frame and a suspended fabric seat with two <b>leg</b> <b>holes,</b> often with trays holding toys. The door jumpers lack the tray. There are also mobile play centers (baby walkers), which look very similar to baby jumpers, but which have wheels.|$|R
50|$|On playgrounds, several swings {{are often}} {{suspended}} from the same metal or wooden frame, known as a swing set, allowing more than one child to play at a time. Such swings {{come in a variety}} of sizes and shapes. For infants and toddlers, swings with <b>leg</b> <b>holes</b> support the child in an upright position while a parent or sibling pushes the child to get a swinging motion. Some swing sets include play items other than swings, such as a rope ladder or sliding pole.|$|R
5000|$|A jacket {{covers the}} torso and arms, {{with little to}} no {{coverage}} for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature <b>leg</b> <b>holes</b> similar to a woman's swimsuit. A third style, the beavertail or bodysuit, has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro fasteners. It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known of these {{stretchy}} latex pants were introduced by Playtex. Playtex baby pants stretched over the diaper much like rubber gloves are stretched over a hand. Undersized <b>leg</b> <b>holes</b> and waist opening allowed the stretchy latex rubber to seal against the skin to contain diaper wetness and therefore protect what ever the baby was placed upon. Ventilation was supposedly provided by two slots (holes) {{in the front of the}} pants up near the waist but they did little more than allow leakage onto the bed when baby slept on its stomach.|$|R
50|$|A teddy, {{also called}} a camiknicker, is a garment which covers the torso and crotch {{in the one}} garment. It is a similar style of garment to a {{one-piece}} swimsuit or bodysuit, but is typically looser and more sheer. The garment is put on by stepping into the <b>leg</b> <b>holes</b> and pulling the garment up to cover the torso. It may cover {{the whole of the}} torso or partially and may also cover the arms. They may open at the crotch for visits to the toilet, without the need to remove all clothing. As an undergarment, it combines the functions of a camisole and panties, and may be preferred to avoid a visible panty line. It is also found as lingerie.|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of C 1 to C 8 hydrocarbons in sediment samples from DSDP <b>Leg</b> 75, <b>Hole</b> 530 A, indicates that {{significant amounts of}} methane and ethane have migrated from organic-rich to organic-lean shales in close proximity. Most compounds larger than ethane are not migrating out of black shales, where they occur in high concentrations. These results lead to a general model for assessing migration.

40|$|The major {{biomarker}} {{compounds in}} surface (0. 95 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) and deep (579. 92 mbsf) sediment {{samples from the}} Benguela Current coastal upwelling system off Lüderitz, Namibia (<b>Leg</b> 175 <b>Hole</b> 1084 A), have been identified and quantified. Lipids of marine origin (especially long-chain alkenones) dominate the solvent-soluble extracts of both samples with minor constituents of terrestrially derived lipids. The paleoenvironmental significance of the more labile biomarker distributions (sterols) is limited by losses from depth-related diagenetic transformations.

The range {{of variation in}} their composition, together with the behavior of compatible trace elements (Co, Ni, Cr), indicate the well-known relative abundance of minerals that crystallize from these basaltic liquids: plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and spinel in decreasing abundance. The hygromagmaphile (or LILE or incompatible) elements are extremely depleted in light rare earths. Nevertheless, some units show flat and enriched REE patterns.

40|$|Late Eocene to Pleistocene planktonic foraminifers from <b>Leg</b> 120 <b>Holes</b> 747 A and 749 B on the Kerguelen Plateau were quantitatively analyzed. Microperforate tenuitellid forms {{dominate}} the Oligocene to middle Miocene, and 17 species (including the new species Tenuitella jamesi and Tenuitellinata selleyi) are recorded. A lineage zonation of tenuitellid foraminifers is proposed {{as an alternative}} scheme for refinement of the Oligocene-Miocene biostratigraphy in high latitudes. Progressive or abrupt alterations in morphological characters within this lineage, producing different morphotypes or species, coincided with prolonged or sudden changes in paleoclimate. These microperforate planktonic foraminifers thus appear to have potential as indicators of cold-water masses and temperature fluctuations in post-Eocene oceans...|$|R
40|$|LECO analysis, {{pyrolysis}} assay, and bitumen and {{elemental analysis}} {{were used to}} characterize the organic matter of 23 black shale samples from Deep Sea Drilling Project <b>Leg</b> 93, <b>Hole</b> 603 B, located in the western North Atlantic. The organic matter is dominantly gas-prone and/or refractory. Two cores within the Turonian and Cenomanian, however, contained significant quantities of well-preserved, hydrogen-enriched, organic matter. This material is thermally immature and represents a potential oil-prone source rock. These sediments {{do not appear to}} have been deposited within a stagnant, euxinic ocean as would be consistent with an "oceanic anoxic event.

40|$|The sulfur {{contents}} of 21 basalt samples from four DSDP <b>Leg</b> 82 <b>holes</b> were determined and the isotopic compositions of sulfur were measured on 15 of them. Most of the basalts are altered and have sulfur {{contents of}} about 100 ppm. Isotopic ratios for sulfate and total sulfur range from + 0. 7 to + 10. 5 per mil, indicating almost complete leaching of the igneous sulfide in low-sulfur samples by alteration. Total sulfur content of some samples ranges between 960 and 1170 ppm, somewhat higher than expected for tholeiitic basalts. The isotope ratios of total sulfur in these samples are slightly shifted to values {{heavier than the}} generally assumed mantle ratio of zero, and this shift is thought to result from a secondary source of sulfur...|$|R
40|$|The biostratigraphic {{distribution}} and abundance of lower Oligocene and Miocene to Pleistocene silicoflagellates are documented from Ocean Drilling Program <b>Leg</b> 183 <b>Holes</b> 1138 A and 1140 A, on the Kerguelen Plateau. The Distephanus speculum speculum forma pseudofibula plexus {{is found in}} the upper Miocene in Hole 1138 A, but other important biostratigraphic markers are not available. Diversity and abundance of silicoflagellates vary considerably in Hole 1138 A, with silicoflagellates more abundant in the Pliocene and Pleistocene and some intervals of the Miocene barren of silicoflagellates or containing only limited numbers of specimens. The silicoflagellates of Hole 1140 A include a new skeletal morphology, described here as Distephanus speculum speculum forma cylindrus. Silicoflagellates were generally abundant throughout the lower and middle Miocene in Hole 1140 A...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of continuous sedimentary sequences {{has been and}} is a high-priority goal of the Ocean Drilling Program, yet its success has not been determined. We test the stratigraphic continuity of continuously cored sequences from ODP <b>Leg</b> 111 <b>Holes</b> 677 A and 677 B and DSDP <b>Leg</b> 69 <b>Hole</b> 504. The two holes at Site 677 and Hole 504 are correlated using high-resolution biostratigraphy, tephra stratigraphy, and time series of opaline silica and calcium carbonate. The correlation coefficient between the time series is maximized through an inverse correlation procedure. Changes in slope of the mapping function that relates the two sections indicate gaps or changes in the accumulation rate between sections. We assume as a first approximation that the sedimentary sequences are identical in each hole, given their close proximity. Slope changes of the mapping functions therefore result from errors introduced by coring. This assumption is justified {{by the fact that}} most mapping function slope changes occur at core breaks. Having identified missing sections in one site, it is possible to fill these gaps with the appropriate section from the adjacent site, thereby improving continuity. This is possible only where the sediment gaps identified at core breaks in one hole do not correspond to core break levels in the other hole. Results show that in the upper 100 m of the stratigraphic column, 3. 1 % and 4. 6 % were unsampled in Holes 677 A and 677 B, respectively, and 15 % of the Pliocene portion of Hole 504 was not sampled by the hydraulic piston corer. This indicates that even in relatively calm seas, double or triple coring is required {{in order to ensure that}} gaps and doubly sampled intervals of the stratigraphic column which occur at core breaks are recognized and sampled at least once...|$|R

Allochthonous diatoms were transported to the equatorial Indian Ocean from inland locations and coastal waters, respectively. The pelagic diatom assemblage consists mainly of warm and/or tropical diatoms known from the Neogene to Holocene. A stratigraphic marker, Rhizosolenia praebergonii var. robusta, which indicates Pliocene-Pleistocene (2. 4 - 1. 55 Ma) age of the sediments, was present in the samples from Core 116 - 717 C- 27 X. Species composition of the whole assemblage is most similar to the tropical Indian Ocean Diatom Zone 6 of Schrader and supports an estimated age of 1. 8 - 2. 1 Ma for the sediments...|$|R
40|$|This {{preliminary}} report does not present {{the distribution of}} selected key planktonic species in each <b>Leg</b> 133 <b>hole,</b> but rather, extracts the best chronodatum levels in two sets of holes, which comprise the Queensland Trough and Townsville Trough transects.

40|$|Both {{dynamic and}} static {{recrystallization}} of serpentinite to soapstone {{have been reported}} from ultramafic massifs in the oceans. While the development of talceous schists is common in detachment faults that are loci of large time-integrated fluid fluxes, static replacement of serpentine by talc {{is more difficult to}} explain. We report on observations made in ODP drill core from <b>Leg</b> 209, <b>Hole</b> 1268, at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) 15 °N, where soapstone is abundant. Talc appears in blackwalls at the contact to small (< 10 m) gabbroic units, but the majority of soapstone is not formed diffusively at mafic/ultramafic contacts. Static replacement of serpentinite by talc starts along anastomosing vein networks and continues to pervasive steatitization, during which the serpentine hourglass texture is preserved.
