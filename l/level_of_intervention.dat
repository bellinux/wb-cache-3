The email-delivered <b>intervention</b> program consists <b>of</b> an implementation intention ‘planning task’ and between 3 and 15 short email messages over a 15 -day study period. The intervention program was developed using the Theory of Planned Behaviour and was designed to modify perceived behavioural control. One hundred and ten participants (mean age = 19. 21 years, 25. 6 % male) completed the feasibility and acceptability questionnaire at Day 15. This questionnaire contained items about all intervention components. High acceptability and feasibility scores were found for all intervention parts and at all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> intensity. There were few significant differences in the reported acceptability of items between key demographic sub-groups, and no differences in reported acceptability at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> intensity. These results suggest that this email-delivered intervention is an acceptable and feasible tool for promoting fruit and vegetable consumption for participants in the target population...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{regulatory}} aspects of exploiting Brazilian public airports under private regime. The proposition {{is that the}} essential difference between leased and permit grants is the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>intervention</b> by the Government, which then determines the legal regime to which the airport exploitation is predominantly subject to. The descriptive and exploratory methodology used is based on previous literature on airport exploitation. The results indicate that airports exploited predominantly under private regime, that is, those granted permits, are generally subject to a lighter regulatory intervention than those exploited under public regime, which are granted a lease, hence the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> necessary regulatory <b>intervention</b> is the main criterion for determining which type of grant shall {{be used for a}} certain airport. The conclusion also indicates that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>intervention</b> to which an airport is subject will depend on the value of use to the collectivity that its operations generate. The optimal granting policy is an ideal combination of types of grants directly related to the diversification of the airport services and the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>intervention</b> that they require...|$|R
40|$|The WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture remain deadlocked {{after four years}} of discussion, and efforts to find a solution at Cancún failed. Analysis shows that the recent draft Cancún text offers more flexibility than earlier proposals, and such flexibility most likely implies a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ambition overall.

50|$|In the RTI process, service {{delivery}} is typically {{divided into three}} levels (tiers) of support, with the intensity of interventions increasing with each level. Tier 1 is focused specifically within the core curriculum, with instruction and interventions targeting all students. Approximately 80% to 85% of the general student body {{should be able to}} meet grade level norms without additional assistance beyond the first tier. Students who consistently do not perform within the expected level of performance through Tier 1 instruction are then provided with additional supplementary interventions at Tier 2, which typically involves small group instruction. Approximately 3% to 6% of students will continue to have difficulties after Tier 2 interventions; these students will then receive Tier 3 intervention services, which is the most intense <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> (often one-on-one) provided in the regular education environment. As RTI is a regular education initiative, all three tiers of services are intended to be provided as supplements to, not replacements for, the regular education curriculum; there are some, however, who view Tier 3 as special education.|$|E
50|$|The use of Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) {{in schools}} is {{widespread}} (Sugai & Horner, 2002) {{in part because}} it is a professional skill in early special education programs (as opposed to Rogerian counseling). The program offers a primary, secondary, and tertiary <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> A basic tenet of the PBIS approach includes identifying students in one of three categories based on risk for behavior problems. Once identified, students receive services in one of three categories: primary, secondary, or tertiary. To help practitioners with differences in interventions used at each of the levels the professional literature refers to a three-tiered (levels) model (Stewart, Martella, Marchand-Martella, & Benner, 2005; Sugai, Sprague, Horner & Walker, 2000; Tobin & Sugai, 2005; Walker et al., 1996.) Interventions are specifically developed for each of these levels with the goal of reducing the risk for academic or social failure. These interventions may be behavioral and or academic interventions incorporating scientifically proven forms of instruction such as direct instruction. The interventions become more focused and complex as one examines the strategies used at each level.|$|E
50|$|A {{student with}} a {{disability}} is always considered for placement within the regular education classroom, and when needed supplementary aides and services {{to meet their needs}} are identified and provided. The members of the IEP team understand the importance of considering regular education as the first educational placement for all students. A student in need of specially designed instruction is supported by the multidisciplinary team and an Individualized Education Plan is developed at least one time annually, or more often as the team determines is needed. All eligible students are reevaluated every two or three years or more often if needed. A student's needs determine the type of service, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> and the percentage of time spent outside of the regular education classroom. Supplementary aids and services and related services may include: psychological services, occupational therapy, physical therapy services, special transportation, speech and language services, school health services, mental health services, assistive technology and devices, adaptive physical education, personal care assistants, and audiological services. Placement decisions are not based solely on the category or severity of a student's disability, the availability of space or the availability of special education or related services. Students in the west Jefferson Hills School District benefit from special education services being provided within the regular education classroom through a co-teaching or inclusion model. In addition, students are provided small group instruction as determined by their IEP. All eligible students are assigned a case manager who is responsible for communicating with parents, monitoring progress and ensuring support is provided in all settings. The majority of the time, students are instructed within a program that is based in the general education curriculum and provided within the regular education setting, with modifications and adaptations to meet the unique needs of each student. Approximately 76% of the students receiving special education services spend at least 80% or more of the school day within the regular education classroom.|$|E
