50|$|The French {{windows to}} the garden terrace were full height and oak framed, with small glazing panels.

The stair itself is of oak with high quality joinery as in all Prior's buildings. The twisted oak balustrade echos the form of the twisting chimneys outside. Oak panelling was used in the billiard room and included Prior's usual use of built in facilities. Ceiling treatments were generally simple, in white distemper. <b>Lighting</b> <b>fittings</b> were typical of the Arts and Craft Movement with a range of ceiling and wall <b>lighting</b> <b>fittings,</b> generally with luminaires suspended by chains with glass shades.|$|E

30|$|Switching off {{lights in}} {{uninhabited}} {{parts of the}} house, and in spaces where natural light can adequately provide the required illumination is a prospect for energy cut. This can be done either automatically or manually by switch. Provision of lighting switches at strategic points can aid manual switching. By utilizing diverse method of automatic controls such as motion detectors, occupancy sensors etc., <b>lighting</b> <b>fittings</b> can either be switched on or off automatically. Energy savings using such devices will prove significant. Programmable timers have the capability of saving up to about 10 – 30  % of lighting energy while occupancy sensors and photo sensors are capable of reducing energy consumption by 30 – 60 and 10 – 35  %, respectively [19].|$|E
