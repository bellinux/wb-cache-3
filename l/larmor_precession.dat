50|$|Ferrimagnetic {{materials}} have high resistivity and have anisotropic properties. The anisotropy is actually induced by an external applied field. When this applied field aligns with the magnetic dipoles it causes a net {{magnetic dipole moment}} and causes the magnetic dipoles to precess at a frequency controlled by the applied field, called <b>Larmor</b> or <b>precession</b> frequency. As a particular example, a microwave signal circularly polarized {{in the same direction}} as this precession strongly interacts with the magnetic dipole moments; when it is polarized in the opposite direction the interaction is very low. When the interaction is strong, the microwave signal can pass through the material. This directional property is used in the construction of microwave devices like isolators, circulators and gyrators. Ferrimagnetic materials are also used to produce optical isolators and circulators. Ferrimagnetic minerals in various rock types are used to study ancient geomagnetic properties of Earth and other planets. That field of study is known as paleomagnetism.|$|R
40|$|Spins {{transverse}} to the magnetization of a ferromagnet only survive over a short distance. We develop a drift-diffusion approach that captures {{the main features}} of transverse spin effects in systems with arbitrary spin textures (e. g., vortices and domain walls) and generalizes the Valet-Fert theory. In addition to the standard characteristic lengths (mean free path for majority and minority electrons, and spin diffusion length), the theory introduces two length scales, the transverse spin coherence length l(perpendicular to) and the (<b>Larmor)</b> spin <b>precession</b> length l(L). We show how l(L) and l(perpendicular to) can be extracted from ab initio calculations or measured with giant magnetoresistance experiments. In long (adiabatic) domain walls, we provide an analytic formula that expresses the so-called "nonadiabatic" (or fieldlike) torque in terms of these length scales. However, this nonadiabatic torque {{is no longer a}} simple material parameter but depends on the actual spin texture: in thin (< 10 nm) domain walls, we observe very significant deviations from the adiabatic limit.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{electron gas}} emerged at a LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface is an ideal system for “spin&# 8211;orbitronics” as the structure itself strongly couple the spin and orbital degree of freedom through the Rashba spin&# 8211;orbit interaction. One of core experiments toward this direction is the nonlocal spin transport measurement, which has remained elusive due to the low spin injection efficiency to this system. Here we bypass the problem by generating a spin current not through the spin injection from outside but instead through the inherent spin Hall effect and demonstrate the nonlocal spin transport. The analysis on the nonlocal spin voltage, confirmed by the signature of a <b>Larmor</b> spin <b>precession</b> and its length dependence, displays that both D’yakonov&# 8211;Perel’ and Elliott&# 8211;Yafet mechanisms involve in the spin relaxation at low temperature.

It is shown that these constraints can be formulated elegantly and consistently in the framework of dissipative Nambu mechanics. This has many consequences for both the variational principle and for topological aspects of hidden symmetries that control conserved quantities. We particularly study how the damping terms of dissipative Nambu mechanics affect the consistent interaction of magnetic systems with stochastic reservoirs and derive a master equation for the magnetization. The proposals are supported by numerical studies using symplectic integrators that preserve the topological structure of Nambu equations. These results are compared to computations performed by direct sampling of the stochastic equations and by using closure assumptions for the moment equations, deduced from the master equation.

50|$|A {{measurement}} of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation. There are two phases to the measurement: polarization and acquisition. First, the hydrogen atoms are aligned {{in the direction of}} a static magnetic field (B0). This polarization takes a characteristic time T1. Second, the hydrogen atoms are tipped by a short burst from an oscillating magnetic field that is designed so that they precess in resonance in a plane perpendicular to B0. The frequency of oscillation is the <b>Larmor</b> frequency. The <b>precession</b> of the hydrogen atoms induces a signal in the antenna. The decay of this signal with time is caused by transverse relaxation and is measured by the CPMG pulse sequence. The decay is the sum of different decay times, called T2.
