5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} a {{research}} study on synthetic lethality in cancer. Synthetic lethality appears when a mutation in a single gene {{has no effect on}} the function of a cell but a mutation in an additional gene leads to cell death. This study aimed to find novel methods of treating cancer through blocking the lethality of drugs. GeneCards was used when comparing data of a given target gene with all possible genes. In this process, the annotation sharing score was calculated using GeneDecks Partner Hunter (now called Genes <b>Like</b> <b>Me)</b> <b>to</b> give paralogy. Inactivation targets were be extracted after the microarray experiments of resistant and non-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines.|$|E

500|$|She {{eventually}} {{separated from}} her husband, divorcing in 1928, and {{had a number of}} affairs. Her lovers included reporter-turned-playwright Charles MacArthur and the publisher Seward Collins. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy, about which Parker is alleged to have remarked, [...] "how <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> put all my eggs into one bastard." [...] She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 speech, British Prime Minister Tony Blair {{referred}} to Grant's {{character in a}} speech, saying: [...] "I know there's a bit of us that would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off. But {{the difference between a}} good film and real life is that in real life there's the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post {{traumatic}} stress disorder, {{accusing them of}} [...] "weakness". According to Savage, [...] "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> save the country. You need men {{to stand up and}} say stop crying like a baby over everything... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military." ...|$|E

From {{this out}} I'm {{just going to}} do exactly as Tom would have <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, no matter how afraid I am of Louisa. And, oh, I am horribly afraid of her." ...|$|R
500|$|Reception of Super Columbine Massacre {{has been}} {{extremely}} negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Special effects makeup {{designer}} David White took {{head and}} body casts of actors, such as Bautista, {{to experiment with}} materials used to create the characters. White said, [...] "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> see the real deal there on set." [...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not. I don't {{understand}} the matter, and I'm not conscious of any mission of that sort. You're evidently disappointed," [...] Isabel added, {{looking at her}} cousin with rueful gentleness. [...] "You'd have <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make such a marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have, and yet.... But I don't accuse you, dearest. Yes, {{you have}} given me pleasure. One truly {{pleasant}} time was when we stood together in the summer-house {{on the evening of}} the garden-party, and you said you <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> love you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he wouldn't. He <b>likes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have friends. Ask him {{yourself}} {{when he comes}} back. The trouble has been that {{two or three of}} his men fell in love with me, and when half drunk got to fighting. You're not going to do that." ...|$|R
500|$|In April 1914, Sibelius mailed {{the score}} and parts to the United States, calling the piece [...] (this {{intermediate}} {{version of the}} tone poem is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Yale" [...] version). On 12 and 20April 1914, Parker wrote on behalf of Stoeckel, expanding upon the initial agreement: Sibelius's American patron now wished him to travel to and conduct a program of his music at the Norfolk festival; as compensation, Sibelius would receive $1,200, as well as an honorary doctorate of music from Yale University. Although he already had sent the manuscript to Norfolk, Sibelius was not satisfied with the score and immediately began to revise the piece, eventually opting for a complete overhaul ("Isn't it just <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> rework the tone poem—at the moment I am ablaze with it."). Although Sibelius was prone to revising his compositions, such effort was usually undertaken when preparing a piece for publication or after having heard it first performed in concert. With respect to the Yale version, it is possible the invitation to attend the music festival in person prompted Sibelius to [...] "reassess" [...] the tone poem with a more critical eye.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Durst {{was tapped}} to write songs for Britney Spears, and later {{said that he}} was in a {{relationship}} with her. Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that [...] "I just guess {{at the time it was}} taboo for a guy <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be associated with a gal like her." ...|$|E
2500|$|And so, girls, when fucking time comes… not {{the faintest}} whiff of it anywhere, right? From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can’t even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. At least they’d {{serve as a}} sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts… [...] So, then! Would you <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> find some {{mechanism}} by which we could end this war? ...|$|E
40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: what it is <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see rain is phenomenally different from what it is <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form what it is <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot {{be traced back to}} variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among what it is <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of what it is <b>like</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R
6000|$|Brissenden {{appeared}} to wonder where I was coming out, yet {{not as if}} he feared it. There was even a particular place, if I could but guess it, where he would have <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come. [...] "Oh, she's extremely charming. But of course she's strikingly odd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{know you}} would be generous and brave about that--about anything. But what--what if I could n't give up my career--my hopes of being useful in the way I have planned? You would n't have <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on practising medicine?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to Emerson's review, O'Reilly {{said that the}} mistakes, which he numbered less than her findings at just [...] "four minor misstatements" [...] and [...] "two typeset errors" [...] and had been corrected in subsequent printings. O'Reilly called the controversy [...] "a concerted effort by people who don’t <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> diminish the book," [...] said that Killing Lincoln was [...] "honest," [...] and wished all students would read it.|$|E
2500|$|Cherry, Tom Spezialy, and Michael Edelstein {{served as}} {{executive}} producers for show's {{the first two}} seasons. Spezialy, who {{also served as a}} staff writer, left his previous position as writer and executive producer for Dead <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> join the [...] Desperate Housewives crew. He had also worked as writer and co-executive producer on several shows, among them Ed, Jack and Jill, and Parker Lewis Can't Lose, while Edelstein had been the executive producer of Threat Matrix and Hope & Faith.|$|E
2500|$|John Shelby Spong once accused Williams {{of being}} a [...] "neo-medievalist", preaching orthodoxy {{to the people in}} the pew but knowing in private that it is not true. In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine Williams responded: [...] "I am genuinely a lot more conservative than he would <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be. Take the Resurrection. I think he has said that of course I know what all the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore when I talk about the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb. But I don't. I don't know how to persuade him, but I really don't." ...|$|E

Sir Richard <b>likes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have a {{house party}} about this time of year, and gives me a free hand as to whom I should invite; all he asks is {{that it should be}} a peaceable party, with no friction or unpleasantness.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} rather strict about it, {{to tell the}} truth," [...] he said, {{lowering}} his voice, to Mrs. Duke. [...] "She never <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lose my cap at school. And when a man's been taught to be tidy and neat it sticks to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Something wrong I have done, and I {{want the}} clue. Was it self-will in {{choosing}} discipline contrary to your mother's judgment? Yet {{she could not}} know all. I thought it her kindness in not <b>liking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lose the pleasure. Besides, one must act for oneself, and this was only my own personal amusement.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Criticism {{has also}} been placed upon media outlets themselves, {{especially}} CNN. During {{the course of the}} delinquent verdict on March 17, 2013, CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was [...] "Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...when that sentence came down, [...] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...He said to him, 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.'" [...] Candy Crowley and Paul Callan were also criticized for their lack of focus on the victim and their sympathy for the rapists.|$|E
2500|$|Candy Crowley, Poppy Harlow and Paul Callan were {{criticized for}} portraying the two convicted rapists in the Steubenville High School rape case sympathetically and for placing very little {{focus on the}} victim on March 17, 2013.

2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{be in touch with}} my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
