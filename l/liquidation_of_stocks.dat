40|$|Using a new daily dataset for all stocks {{traded on}} the New York Stock Exchange, we study the {{evolution}} of information asymmetry during runs on financial institutions and the subsequent liquidity freeze of October 1907 - one of the severest financial crises of the 20 th century. We find that increased informational risk and resulting runs on financial institutions led to a freeze in short-term money markets, which forced <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> positions, and drained liquidity from the stock market: spreads increased from 0. 5 % to 3 % during the crisis episode. This liquidity freeze was primarily driven by fears of informed trading and was most intense for the mining sector. In addition to wider spreads and tight money markets, freezing liquidity manifests itself in fading trading volume and increased price sensitivity to changes in trading volume. Importantly, short-term liquidity measures {{did not have a}} long-lasting soothing effect on trading volume, but only on prices. We go on to show that rising illiquidity is associated with lower asset prices. Thus, our findings demonstrate how opaque markets can easily transmit an idiosyncratic rumor into a long-lasting, market-wide crisis. They demonstrate the usefulness of illiquidity measures to alert market participants to pendings market runs...|$|R

There is an ambiguous interpretation of current legal regulations about the <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> legal entities, liquidator itself and particularly terms of reference of company authorities in liquidation. There are also a lot of arguably legal question about this relation that is answered in this thesis. The purpose of this thesis is not a just definition of liquidator or valuation of problematic areas according to liquidator's position. The thesis is also targeted on the activity of liquidator inside and outside the company related to solving reciprocal relation between liquidator and authorities of the company. The thesis is using critical analysis method of existing law regulations and contemporary legislation, judgments, articles to solve controversial questions which have not been removed during recodification of civil law which united civil and commercial adaptation <b>of</b> <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> the company.

Using conventional event study methodology, no significant price changes are found following the delisting events, consistent with the voluntary nature of the delistings and the public information nature of the delisting reasons cited, i. e., small number of shareholders and low trading volume for the dually-listed stocks in the host market. Nonetheless, stock prices, on average, do seem to drop gradually over time, in line with possible <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> the to-be-delisted <b>stocks</b> around the events. ...|$|R
500|$|Although calm {{was largely}} {{restored}} in New York by Saturday, November 2, yet another crisis loomed. One of the exchange's largest brokerage firms, Moore & Schley, was heavily {{in debt and}} in danger of collapse. The firm had borrowed heavily, using shares of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TC) as collateral. With {{the value of the}} thinly traded stock under pressure, many banks would likely call the loans of Moore & Schley on Monday and force an en masse <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> the firm's <b>stock.</b> If that occurred it would send [...] TC shares plummeting, devastating Moore and Schley and triggering further panic in the market.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{risk-adjusted}} optimal timing to liquidate an option at the prevailing market price. In addition to maximizing the expected discounted return from option sale, we incorporate a path-dependent risk penalty based on shortfall or quadratic {{variation of the}} option price up to the liquidation time. We establish {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to immediately liquidate or hold the option position through expiration. Furthermore, we study the variational inequality associated with the optimal stopping problem, and prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. A series of analytical and numerical results are provided to illustrate the non-trivial optimal liquidation strategies under geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. We examine the combined effects of price dynamics and risk penalty on the sell and delay regions for various options. In addition, we obtain an explicit closed-form solution for the <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>stock</b> with quadratic penalty under the GBM model. Comment: 26 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
