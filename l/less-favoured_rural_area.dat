First, we briefly introduced the less favoured areas in Romania and Austria, with their constraints and characteristics. Secondly, we focused on the local development strategies of two less-favoured communities from these countries.

40|$|In <b>less-favoured</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Europe, the {{implementation}} of agri- environmental policies has encouraged land managers to reconcile pastoral stakes (producing feeding resources for livestock) and environmental ones (preserving biodiversity) in "concerted approaches". Previous works {{have shown that the}} effectiveness of such concerted approaches depends on cognitive synchronisation processes between the various stakeholders involved, and thus their collective ability to share knowledge. We present here an interdisciplinary research project (combining cognitive management science and ecology) to investigate the combination of heterogeneous knowledge from two different fields (agriculture and environment, respectively), By observing and participating in various land use management projects, especially in the Pyrenean pastoral areas, we will analyze how shared knowledge (especially to produce operational indicators on vegetation) is issued from formalising and combining different knowledge sources (know-how and knowing, formal and informal, empirical and scientific, etc.). As a first step, we built a typology to specify different knowledge-sharing situations...|$|R
40|$|Roughly 40 {{percent of}} the world’s poor live in South Asia, where poverty is {{basically}} a rural problem. Therefore, a significant gain in rural poverty reduction in this sub-region will be crucial to reach the international poverty reduction target. Based on the analysis and experience of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), this paper argues that to be successful, poverty reduction policies in South Asia must focus on the <b>less-favoured</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and on most disadvantaged sections of the rural poor (mainly women, the landless and indigenous peoples). In order to overcome disadvantages arising from remoteness, lack of social services, insecure and unproductive jobs, and discrimination as women or ethnic minorities, the rural poor need legally secure access to productive assets (mainly land, forests and water); sustainable or regenerating agricultural technology; access to markets; opportunities to participate in decentralized resource management; and access to financial services. ...|$|R

40|$|The Romanian rural {{economy is}} mainly an {{agricultural}} economy, as {{the share of}} agricultural economy is 60 % compared to 14 % in European Union. Most farmers practise part-time agriculture, insufficiently spending the working time on agricultural activities. In total Romanian <b>rural</b> <b>area,</b> the non-agricultural economy (SMEs in industry, services, rural tourism) has a low share, while the rural tourism, except for certain mountain zones and the Danube Delta is poorly developed. In such conditions, the paper contains an inventory {{of the most important}} methods for increasing the available time used in non-agricultural activities, as alternatives for part-time agriculture, which may become an important income source for family farms. The work relies on data processed according to the European Commission Statistics (Eurostat) and the national statistics, in order to reveal the labour force employment in agriculture. The investments in the non-agricultural and food economy, while contributing to gross value added increase through the processing of agricultural and non-agricultural raw materials from local resources, has another great advantage, by creating new jobs and by using and maintaining the local (rural) labour, revitalization of rural localities, mainly those in the <b>less-favoured</b> and remote <b>rural</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

However, the mapping of the phenomenon in countries as Italy and Spain suggest that industrial districts are also present in <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The objective of this contribution is the identification, mapping and characterization of industrial districts located in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> as well as to evaluate the extent in which industrial districts in predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> have contributed to the dynamism of these areas. The analysis analyzes the importance of industrial districts for rural development and provides some recommendations regarding policy strategies. Specifically, the study illustrates some relevant results. First, industrial districts are present in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of Italy and Spain although their importance is higher in Spain. Second, industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are geographically concentrated in a few <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Third, patterns of specialization of industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> do not differ from their patterns in other <b>areas.</b> Fourth, predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts grow between two and three times faster than the rest of <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Fifth, a significant share of the growth of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts is explained by the more dynamic behaviour of these districts. Sixth, the results do not vary when transferring the unit of analysis from industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> to industrial districts with characteristics of predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The existence of industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and their positive economic impact suggest that they have an important potential for development in those concrete <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> where they are present.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{proposed}} in answering {{to the question}} of “What types of partisipation do farmers give in developing <b>Rurals</b> <b>Areas</b> in Regency of Konawe”. This study was conducted in the <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of farmers who have joined in farmer groups, included outlying <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and swasembada <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in the Regency of Konawe. Technique of choosing samples was carried out by ”cluster purposive sampling”, i. e., firstly, population is grouped based on regions/rural areas, then 5 respondents are chosen purposively from every farmer (member of farmer group) who have been choosen from 10 <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, 50 samples of respondents are chosen (farmers who are members of farmer group). Data collection was undertaken by three methods, they are: (1) indepth observation, (2) indepth interview, and (3) focus group discussion (FGD). Questions on the implementation of <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> development in list of questionnaire forms are formulated into three stages of categories; they are full participation (PP) with score 3, partly/moderate participation (PS) with score 2, and less participation with score 1. The result shows that type of farmers participations mostly are categorized into partly/moderate participation, that is 72 percent, and the rest, respectively, are 10. 66 percent for full participation and 17, 34 percent for less participation. Types of participations in developing <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Regency of Konawe were carried out through three models of participation approach, i. e., farmer participation in developing means and infrastructure of <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> participation in strengthening sosio-economical <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> and participation in improving output of <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> farming. In conclusion, opportunity, competence, and willingness of farmers to take part in developing <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are very low because of the barrier of social system from elite groups in <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as it is mostly influenced by the dependence of government program realization, as well as social mobilization which is most familiar in rural communities.

30|$|A further {{category}} includes location variables, such as dummies for RDP zoning. This zoning {{was performed}} using inhabitant density per municipality {{and the level}} of income. The area of Tuscany was classified into five categories (see Tuscany Region 2007 for a definition of the criteria used). Municipalities located inside urban areas belong to the first category, (poli_urb). The second category (rur_int) contains municipalities located in areas whose population density is lower than 300 inhabitants per square kilometre but with very intensive production. The three remaining zones correspond to <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> characterised by increasing socio-economic concerns, namely <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in transition (rur_trans), declining <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> (rur_decl), and <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with development problems (rur_probsv). To identify these additional three categories, variables concerning the share of agricultural labour in the total labour force with respect to the EU 25 average value, were considered in order to identify a declining <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> (rur_decl). Finally <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in transition and <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with development problems were identified using criteria of urban density less than 150 inhabitants. An additional criterion to distinguish between these two was the amount of tourism in the municipality. Thus municipalities close to urban areas or with tourist attractions (for example in coastal areas) were classified as <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in transition (rur_trans), while others were classified as declining <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> (rur_decl).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{determining}} the typology of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> {{on the basis}} of internationally established methodological approaches. The attempt to define the <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Slovenia is made {{on the basis of}} two selected methodological approaches. The first analysis employed the OECD methodology of classification of urban-rural areas. In order to adapt this methodology to Slovenian territory, another, indicator-based analysis was conducted, where by the indicators were selected according to a previously created typology of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and according to Slovene legal bases. After the review and analysis of the indicators, individual types of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> were defined. The classification of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> was carried out in two steps. Firstly, three types of areas were determined: typical <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> and areas of urban character. In the second step, areas were divided into demographically restricted areas, structure-restricted areas, moderately structure-restricted areas and predominantly developed areas. The comparison of these two approaches to defining <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> showed that the urban-rural classification is more suitable for Slovenian conditions and that the differences between the two approaches are minimal. In both cases, the majority of areas are classified as intermediate and transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> On the national level, both classifications show similar results. All urban areas are located close to the main highway cross with its centre in Ljubljana, the capital of the country. <b>Rural</b> <b>areas</b> as well as intermediate and transitional <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are scattered over the rest of the country’s territory without any specific pattern. Based on the comparison of the two classifications, we found out that it is impossible to define homogeneous areas on the basis of only one indicator and that a combination of several indicators is necessary...|$|R
