50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But digital ground current must not pass through the analog grounding system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue circuits. Phase lock loop circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{consistent}} {{problem that}} plagued the spacecraft {{during the early}} portion of its mission was that roll error signal transients would occur frequently and on occasion would cause loss of the Canopus star lock. The first attempt at a midcourse maneuver was aborted by a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock</b> shortly after the gyros began spinup. Canopus lock was lost six times within a period of {{less than three weeks}} after launch and each time a sequence of radio commands would be required to reacquire the star. After a study of the problem, the investigators concluded that the behavior was due to small dust particles that were being released from the spacecraft by some means and were drifting through the star sensor field-of-view. Sunlight scattered from the particles then appeared as illumination equivalent to that from a bright star. This would cause a roll error transient as the object passed through the field-of-view while the sensor was locked onto Canopus. When the object was bright enough that it exceeded the high gate limits at eight times the Canopus intensity, the spacecraft would automatically disacquire Canopus and initiate a roll search for a new star. Finally, a radio command was sent on December 17, 1964, that removed the high gate limit. There was no further loss of Canopus lock, although roll transients occurred 38 more times before encounter with Mars.|$|E

30|$|At auroral and polar latitudes, phase {{scintillation}} occurs rather than intensity scintillation, {{for example in}} the presence of particle precipitation, which induces ionisation between the E and F regions, and polar cap patches, which are typically propagating anti-sunward and extend to about 600  km in altitude. Due to the field-aligned nature of these structures and because of the fast plasma drift velocities combined with the typical geometries, intensity scintillation is not easily observed by ground-based GNSS receivers, while fluctuations on the signal phase are more easily detected (Rino and Matthews 1980). At auroral and polar latitudes, therefore, fading does not tend to occur on ground-based GNSS receivers. However, when the phase fluctuations become very large (i.e. σ _ϕ > 1 rad), <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock</b> can be induced.|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} by [23], the C/N 0 estimator {{is often used}} as a delay lock indicator. More specifically, the C/N 0 is estimated from the average post-correlation power, i.e. the C/N 0 is directly proportional to the correlation value that is in turn {{an indicator of the}} delay error. If a large delay error is committed then the correlation value and the C/N 0 are significantly reduced. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock</b> on the delay is thus reflected in randomly varying C/N 0 estimates.

40|$|Abstract: Integer {{ambiguity}} resolution at {{a single}} station can be preformed if the fractional-cycle biases are separated from the ambiguity estimates in precise point positioning (PPP). Despite the improved positioning accuracy by such integer resolutions, the convergence to an ambiguity-fixed solution normally requires {{at least a few}} tens of minutes. More importantly, such convergences can repeatedly occur on the occasion <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> tracking <b>locks</b> for many satellites if an open sky-view is not constantly available, consequently totally destroying the practicability of real-time PPP. In this study, in case of such re-convergences, we develop a method in which ionospheric delays are precisely predicted to significantly accelerate integer ambiguity resolutions. The effectiveness of this method consists in two aspects: First, wide-lane ambiguities can be rapidly resolved using the ionosphere-corrected wide-lane measurements, instead of the noisy Melbourne-Wübbena combination measurements; second, narrow-lane ambiguity resolution can be accelerated under the tight constraints derived from the ionosphere-corrected unambiguous wide-lane measurements. In the tests at 90 static stations suffering from simulated total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tracking <b>locks,</b> 93. 3 % and 95. 0 % of re-convergences to wide-lane and narrow-lane ambiguity resolutions can be achieved within 5 s, respectively, even though the time latency for the predicted ionospheric delays is up to 180 s.

To achieve highly accurate angular estimates, the precise GNSS carrier phase observables must be employed.

This contribution presents a GNSS carrier phase-based attitude determination method that determines the integer ambiguities and attitude in an integral manner, thereby fully exploiting the known body geometry of the multi-antennae configuration. It is shown that this integral approach aids the ambiguity resolution process tremendously and strongly improves the capacity of fixing the correct set of integer ambiguities. In this contribution, the challenging scenario of single-epoch, single-frequency attitude determination is addressed.

40|$|Abstract—Ionospheric scintillations {{are known}} to affect both the {{magnitude}} and the phase of the incoming GNSS signal. These phase variations are typically synchronized with a deep fade of the signal level, {{that could lead to}} the occurrence of cycle slips (phase jumps), errors in the data demodulation and ultimately <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock.</b> These effects have an impact not only on accuracy, but also availability, continuity and integrity. This particular aspect is of critical importance since ionospheric scintillations have been identified as one of the causes for integrity faults that need to be detected in safety critical applications. At receiver level, this can be tackled by the use of robust tracking techniques. In particular, the impact on carrier phase tracking is very important as it is more prone to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>lock,</b> and it is often used to smooth the code measurements, carrier aiding or even Doppler/user dynamics estimation. Moreover, it is through the impact on phase estimation that the data demodulation capability can be assessed, as well as different applications such as ionospheric characterization.
