40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent {{audit of the}} utility distribution meters in a petrochemical plant. These meters measure the steam, condensate, natural gas, water, nitrogen and air flows to the different process units within the plant. This audit started {{as an attempt to}} resolve discrepancies between the 650 PSIG steam distribution and <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> Theoretically the sum of the 650 PSIG steam flows to the units should have matched the total of the steam supplied to the plant. However, in this plant the monthly totals of the distribution were consistently 15 % - 25 % lower than the <b>supply</b> <b>meter</b> totals. The plant is billed {{on the basis of the}} <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> Therefore, these discrepancies represented a significant utility cost, approximately $ 150, 000 a year, that was arbitrarily allocated among the different units. The plant commissioned an audit of the 650 PSIG distribution and <b>supply</b> <b>meters.</b> The purpose of this audit was to: 1. Certify that there were no users not monitored by the existing distribution meters. 2. Verify the operability and accuracy of the meters. Hopefully, the results of the audit would allow the plant to account for at least 90 % of the steam supplied. This accounting was necessary for equitable distribution of utility costs and accurate determination of unit production costs. The project was eventually expanded to include all utility streams. The audit of the following utilities was funded and implemented due to their relatively high unit costs: 650 PSIG steam, 200 PSIG steam, natural gas, and nitrogen. The audit of the other utilities is planned but a schedule has not been established...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringA thermal {{management}} system for high heat flux is in great demand as the device sizes become smaller. A {{failure of the}} optimal {{thermal management}} leads to poor performance, large degradation, and/or complete system breakdown. The optimal thermal management system requires both a low thermal resistance [order of 0. 01 K/(W/cm 2) ] and high heat flux cooling capability [order of 1 kW/cm 2]. A kinetics of a phase change, i. e., liquid-vapor, provides a good potential to remove high heat flux in evaporators due to a significant latent heat. However, the challenges are the limited <b>liquid</b> <b>supply</b> to the high heat flux surface due to the viscous-capillary limit and a large thermal resistance due to low effective thermal conductivity of the evaporator wick. Here, the optimal evaporator wick for the enhanced <b>liquid</b> <b>supply</b> system is studied using the monolayer and liquid artery wick, to simultaneously reduce the thermal resistance and enhance the heat flux. An innovative liquid artery (thick) wick with monolayer (thin) wick has been demonstrated previously, qCHF ~ 600 W/cm 2 with AhRk,e < 0. 05 K/(W/cm 2), where the monolayer wick limits the <b>liquid</b> <b>supply</b> to the heated surface and heat transport. Further improvements require the optimal designs of the monolayer wick for desired permeability, porosity, saturation, and capillary meniscus. Geometric optimizations are performed using both the thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium models including developed close form solutions. For 60 μm particle with the distance between particles 1. 12 times the particle diameter, qCHF is obtained around 87 to 90 degree of the angle to the liquid contact, leading to the qCHF ~ 1 kW/cm 2. The capillary meniscus recess is also discussed as the liquid morphologies of the monolayer wick drastically change near the particle neck. The effects of the particle size and distance among the particles on the heat flux and thermal resistance are also discussed...|$|R

As the <b>liquid</b> <b>supply</b> rate increases beyond the rate of heat transfer by thermal conduction, a decreasing fraction of the liquid can vaporize.
