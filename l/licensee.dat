It is the only licensed premises in Carrick and has been operated as a hotel for the entire of its history.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the lessons learned}} from the nine pilot site visits that were performed to review early implementation of the maintenance rule using the draft NRC Maintenance Inspection Procedure. <b>Licensees</b> followed NUMARC 93 - 01, ``Industry Guideline for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants. `` In general, the <b>licensees</b> were thorough in determining which structures, systems, and components (SSCS) were within the scope of the maintenance rule at each site. The use of an expert panel was an appropriate and practical method of determining which SSCs are risk significant. When setting goals, all <b>licensees</b> considered safety but many <b>licensees</b> did not consider operating experience throughout the industry. Although required to do so, <b>licensees</b> were not monitoring at the system or train level the performance or condition for some systems used in standby service but not significant to risk. Most <b>licensees</b> had not established adequate monitoring of structures under the rule. <b>Licensees</b> established reasonable plans for doing periodic evaluations, balancing unavailability and reliability, and assessing the effect of taking equipment out of service for maintenance.

Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|Source Tracking System (NSTS) {{by their}} <b>licensees</b> {{and to provide}} {{reference}} information to aid in this effort. Background: In December 2008, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) initiated the process of credentialing potential NSTS users {{in order for them}} to access the system and report their source transactions online. Since the process began, the NRC has approved access to over 900 individuals representing over 600 <b>licensees.</b> The credentialing process is contractually required in order to obtain the necessary Level 4 security certificate and requires a rigorous and time consuming identity proofing process. Although the process is lengthy and technically challenging, the NRC strongly encourages <b>licensees</b> to use the online system as it is the most effective, efficient, and most accurate method to report their source transactions. While the regulations allows for various methods to report source transactions, many <b>licensees</b> have opted to report their transactions via fax, which has proved to create a number of issues.

5|$|The {{date that}} the {{building}} was first constructed is uncertain, with best estimates putting the build date during the Georgian era around the late 17th century as a timber-framed house; this {{is determined by the}} chamfered beams and the rectangular lobby entrance with the front door centrally-located, opening to back-to-back fireplaces with main rooms to the left and right, known as a 'baffle-entry' layout. It transitioned into use as a public house by 1754, which is a common origin of country pubs. It was mentioned in the Melville's Directory of 1858, with Joseph Charlton as the <b>licensee.</b> In 1895 William Sayer, a former landlord of the pub, was killed in a collapse at a nearby chalk mine. It appears on historical maps from 1867, 1897 and various others since, and was labelled as the Royal Oak Public House on all but the first. A number of brickworks were located adjacent to the pub in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and companies licensed to operate nuclear power reactors (or <b>licensees)</b> apply probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) to natural hazards at operating U. S. nuclear reactors to a limited extent. When the 104 operating reactors were originally licensed before 1997, NRC required <b>licensees</b> to assess natural hazards using deterministic analysis, which—informed by historical experience, test results, and expert judgment—considers {{a specific set of}} potential accidents and how the consequences of those accidents can be prevented and mitigated. Subsequent to most of these initial licenses being issued, NRC, through policy statements and other documents, has endorsed PRA—a systematic method for assessing what can go wrong, its likelihood, and its consequences, resulting in quantitative estimates of risk—as a means to enhance and extend traditional deterministic analysis. In 1991, NRC requested that <b>licensees</b> voluntarily examine their reactors’ vulnerability to natural hazards and suggested PRA as one of several possible methods for <b>licensees</b> to use in their examinations. However, most <b>licensees</b> opted to use other methods. According to NRC officials and nuclear power industry representatives—and reflected in data GAO obtained from five <b>licensees</b> that together operate 25 reactors—few <b>licensees</b> are likely to have developed or updated since the 1990 s PRAs that address natural hazards. NRC would have to conduct an analysis {{to determine whether or not}} to require <b>licensees</b> to develop PRAs that address natural hazards. According to agency officials, NRC has not conducted such an analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the distinction between}} thin and thick contracts to the investigation of licensing-in as a mechanism for technological learning.

Drawing on a sample of 133 <b>licensees</b> and {{an equal number of}} matched non <b>licensees,</b> we present empirical evidence that thick contracts propel the licensees’ likelihood of introducing new inventions. It is also found that thick contracts act as a substitute for licensees’ absorptive capacity. <b>Licensees</b> that are more familiar with the licensed technology are in less need of assistance from the licensors to assimilate and integrate the knowledge. However, this substitution effect is neutralized once the hurdle of invention has been overcome, meaning that the <b>licensees</b> have succeeded to ignite the invention process, suggesting the exploitation of the learning curve, triggered by their mutual understanding...|$|R
