5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's <b>library</b> {{was started}} {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The <b>library</b> grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the <b>library</b> in the early years. The <b>library</b> was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University <b>Library,</b> which by 1901 was a free, general <b>library</b> with both circulating and reference collections. That year the <b>library</b> collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{complicated}} to precisely define circulating <b>libraries</b> and specifically what separates them from {{other types of}} <b>libraries.</b> In the time period of circulating <b>libraries,</b> there were other <b>libraries,</b> such as subscription <b>libraries,</b> that operated {{in a similar fashion}} but were not the same. However, when both types of <b>libraries</b> were commonplace, the terms circulating <b>libraries</b> and subscription <b>libraries</b> “were completely interchangeable." [...] It was logical that they were considered to be the same since both <b>libraries</b> circulated books and charged a subscription fee. The <b>libraries</b> differed in their intent. Circulating libraries’ intent was financial gain, and subscription <b>libraries</b> intended to obtain literary and scholarly works to share with others.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 18th century, <b>libraries</b> were {{becoming}} increasingly public and were more frequently lending <b>libraries.</b> The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial <b>libraries</b> to lending <b>libraries.</b> Before this time, public <b>libraries</b> were parochial in nature and <b>libraries</b> frequently chained their books to desks. <b>Libraries</b> also were not uniformly open to the public.|$|R

5|$|In 1914, the YWCA of Salem was {{organized}} by the same Salem Women's Club. Located in downtown on Cottage Street Northeast, the YWCA moved in 1954 to the lot adjoining the <b>library.</b> By the 1960s, the small <b>library</b> had a collection in excess of 100,000 volumes, but needed a larger facility. A public campaign {{to build a new}} <b>library</b> began in 1968, with the <b>library</b> {{to be part of a}} larger government center that included a city hall and fire station. In 1971, the YWCA purchased the adjacent Carnegie <b>library</b> building for $150,000, and on July 6, 1972, the Salem Public <b>Library</b> vacated the Carnegie building and moved to Salem’s new Civic Center located west of the old <b>library.</b> Located next to the YWCA's existing home, the old <b>library</b> was turned into the organization's youth center.

40|$|Combinatorial <b>libraries</b> {{continue}} to {{play a key role in}} drug discovery. To increase structural diversity, several experimental methods have been developed. However, limited efforts have been performed so far to quantify the diversity of the broadly used diversity-oriented synthetic (DOS) <b>libraries.</b> Herein we report a comprehensive characterization of 15 bis-diazacyclic combinatorial <b>libraries</b> obtained through <b>libraries</b> from <b>libraries,</b> which is a DOS approach. Using MACCS keys, radial and different pharmacophoric fingerprints as well as six molecular properties, it was demonstrated the increased structural and property diversity of the <b>libraries</b> from <b>libraries</b> over the individual <b>libraries.</b> Comparison of the <b>libraries</b> to existing drugs, NCI Diversity and the Molecular <b>Libraries</b> Small Molecule Repository revealed the structural uniqueness of the combinatorial <b>libraries</b> (mean similarity < 0. 5 for any fingerprint representation). In particular, bis-cyclic thiourea <b>libraries</b> were the most structurally dissimilar to drugs retaining drug-like character in property space. This study represents the first comprehensive quantification of the diversity of <b>libraries</b> from <b>libraries</b> providing a solid quantitative approach to compare and contrast the diversity of DOS <b>libraries</b> with existing drugs or any other compound collection...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of <b>libraries</b> and associated subjects such as the book trade in Halifax and Huddersfield and their environs as defined by Halifax parish and Almondbury, Huddersfield, Kirkburton and Kirkheaton parishes. Chronologically it covers a period of over three centuries from the mid-sixteenth century to {{the coming of the}} public <b>libraries</b> in Halifax in 1882 and in Huddersfield in 1898. The Introduction outlines reasons for undertaking this study and includes a literature review. It is followed by six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the economic, religious and educational background to the area to 1830. Chapter 2 on writing, the book trade and <b>libraries</b> from the mid-sixteenth century to the mid-eighteenth century covers {{the development of}} bookselling and printing, Church of England and nonconformist <b>libraries</b> and school <b>libraries.</b> Chapter 3 on the book trade and <b>libraries</b> from the mid-eighteenth century to 1830 comprises sections on bookselling and printing, reading and private collections, school <b>libraries,</b> book clubs, subscription <b>libraries,</b> newsrooms, commercial circulating <b>libraries</b> and <b>libraries</b> of churches, chapels and religious organisations. Chapter 4 continues with the economic, religious and educational background for the second part of this study 1830 -c. 90. Chapter 5 on secular <b>libraries</b> from 1830 to the coming of the public <b>libraries</b> includes bookselling and printing, reading and private collections, school <b>libraries,</b> subscription <b>libraries,</b> literary and philosophical society <b>libraries</b> and other special <b>libraries,</b> mechanics' institute <b>libraries,</b> factory <b>libraries,</b> commercial circulating <b>libraries,</b> newsrooms and co-operative society <b>libraries.</b> Chapter 6 on <b>libraries</b> attached to churches, chapels and religious organisations for the same period comprises sections on <b>libraries</b> of the Church of England, nonconformist chapels, the Society of Friends and Sunday schools. An Epilogue describes the introduction of public <b>libraries</b> in Halifax and Huddersfield, but their subsequent history is excluded. The thesis ends with a Conclusion.

The <b>library</b> was predated by a freeholders' <b>library</b> in the 1860s, which eventually {{gave way to a}} reading room that was organized and funded by a women's' group in 1901. With a grant for $15,000, among other funds, a new <b>library</b> for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a Carnegie <b>library.</b> The building, located at 2026 N.W.

Notable as the first major branch of the Seattle public <b>library</b> system, after Seattle annexed the City of Ballard into itself in 1907, and for employing one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, the Ballard Carnegie <b>Library</b> was in service until 1963, when a newer and more modern facility replaced it.
