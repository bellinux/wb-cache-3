40|$|Deciding whether two {{fingerprint}} marks {{originate from}} the same source requires examination and comparison of their features. Many cognitive factors {{play a major role}} in such information processing. In this paper we examined the consistency (both between- and within-experts) in the analysis of <b>latent</b> <b>marks,</b> and whether the presence of a 'target' comparison print affects this analysis. Our findings showed that the context of a comparison print affected analysis of the latent mark, possibly influencing allocation of attention, visual search, and threshold for determining a 'signal'. We also found that even without the context of the comparison print there was still a lack of consistency in analysing <b>latent</b> <b>marks.</b> Not only was this reflected by inconsistency between different experts, but the same experts at different times were inconsistent with their own analysis. However, the characterization of these inconsistencies depends on the standard and definition of what constitutes inconsistent. Furthermore, these effects were not uniform; the lack of consistency varied across fingerprints and experts. We propose solutions to mediate variability in the analysis of friction ridge skin...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of forensic photographs often requires the calibration {{of the resolution}} of the image so that accurate measurements can be taken of crime-scene exhibits or <b>latent</b> <b>marks.</b> In the case of <b>latent</b> <b>marks,</b> such as fingerprints, image calibration to a given dots-per-inch is a necessary step for image segmentation, preprocessing, extraction of feature minutiae and subsequent fingerprint matching. To enable scaling, such photographs are taken with forensic rulers in the frame so that image pixel distances can be converted to standard measurement units (metric or imperial). In forensic bureaus, this is commonly achieved by manual selection of two or more points on the ruler within the image, and entering the units of the measure distance. The process can be laborious and inaccurate, especially when the ruler graduations are indistinct because of poor contrast, noise or insufficient resolution. Here the authors present a fully automated method for detecting and estimating the direction and graduation spacing of rulers in forensic photographs. The method detects the location of the ruler in the image and then uses spectral analysis to estimate the direction and wavelength of the ruler graduations. The authors detail the steps of the algorithm and demonstrate the accuracy of the estimation on both a calibrated set of test images and a wide collection of good and poor quality crime-scene images. The method is shown to be fast and accurate and has wider application in other imaging disciplines, such as radiography, archaeology and surveying...|$|E
40|$|There {{appears to}} be a limited but growing body of {{research}} on the sequential analysis/treatment of multiple types of evidence.

This study aims to contribute to a strategy for maximising evidence recovery and efficiency for the detection of <b>latent</b> <b>marks</b> and saliva.

30|$|The IIIT-D latent {{fingerprint}} database {{was introduced by}} Sankaran et al. [19]. It consists of 1046 images of which 1025 contain fingermarks. These marks have been captured from each finger of 15 subjects under semi-controlled conditions. The <b>latent</b> <b>marks</b> were dusted using black powder and captured with a high-quality camera (Canon EOS 500 D) at a resolution of 4752 × 3168 px. The authors captured the marks {{over the course of}} multiple sessions on two different backgrounds (card and tile); the fingers producing the marks showed different levels of “dryness, wetness and moisture”. We cropped the images manually in order to contain only the fingermarks. After cropping, we rescaled the images to 500 ppi to ensure Verifinger would recognise them before we separated them into different test databases according to the background used: T^C_IIIT-D (card, 383 images) and T^T_IIIT-D (tile, 642 images).|$|E

This study sought to determine the use of gamma irradiation as an effective biological decontaminant and its effect on the recovery of latent fingermarks from both porous and nonporous items. Test items were contaminated with viable spores marked with latent prints and then decontaminated using a cobalt 60 gamma irradiator. Fingermark detection was the focus with standard methods including 1, 2 -indanedione, ninhydrin, diazafluoren- 9 -one, and physical developer used during this study. DNA recovery using 20 % Chelex extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was also explored. Gamma irradiation proved effective as a bacterial decontaminant with D-values ranging from 458 to 500 Gy for nonporous items and 797 – 808 Gy for porous ones.

40|$|Abstract—The {{existing}} {{high resolution}} palmprint matching algorithms essentially follow the minutiae-based fingerprint matching strategy {{and focus on}} full-to-full/partial-to-full palmprint comparison. These algorithms would face problems when they are applied to forensic palmprint recognition where <b>latent</b> <b>marks</b> have much smaller area than full palmprints. Therefore, towards forensic scenarios, we propose a novel matching strategy based on regional fusion for high resolution palmprint recognition using regions segmented by major creases features. The matching strategy includes two stages: 1) region-to-region palmprint comparison; 2) regional fusion at score level. We first studied regional discriminability of a high resolution palmprint under the concept of three regions, i. e., interdigital, hypothenar and thenar, {{which is the most}} significant difference between palmprits and fingerprints. Then we implemented regional fusion based on logistic regression at score level using region-to-region comparison scores obtained by a commercial SDK, MegaMatcher 4. 0. Significant improvement of recognition accuracy is achieved by regional fusion on a public high resolution palmprint database THUPALMLAB. The EER of logistic regression based regional fusion is 0. 25 %, while the EER of full-to-full palmprint comparison is 1 %. Keywords-High resolution palmprints; regional fusion. I...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the removal of distracting {{background}} patterns from forensic evidence so that the evidence is rendered more visible. An example {{is the image of}} a finger print on a non-periodic background. The method involves registering the image with a control image of the background pattern that we seek to remove. A statistical comparison of the registered images identifies the <b>latent</b> <b>mark.</b> The registration of the images involves both a geometric and a photometric component. The geometric registration is invariant to perspective distortion and the photometric registration invariant to affine colour-space transformations. The algorithm is based on a robust Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Both the registration and the comparison algorithms are automatic. The paper briefly explains these algorithms. The method applies in situations where periodic background removal (e. g. Fourier techniques) would not be successful. The method has proven effective in extracting latent fingermark [...] ...|$|R

40|$|After over a century, {{fingerprints}} {{are still}} one of the most powerful means of biometric identification. The conventional forensic workflow for suspect identification consists of (i) recovering <b>latent</b> <b>marks</b> from crime scenes using the appropriate enhancement technique and (ii) obtaining an image of the mark to compare either against known suspect prints and/or to search in a Fingerprint Database. The suspect is identified through matching the ridge pattern and local characteristics of the ridge pattern (minutiae). However successful, there are a number of scenarios in which this process may fail; they include the recovery of partial, distorted or smudged marks, poor quality of the image resulting from inadequacy of the enhancement technique applied, extensive scarring/abrasion of the fingertips or absence of suspect's fingerprint records in the database. In all of these instances it would be very desirable to have a technology able to provide additional information from a fingermark exploiting its endogenous and exogenous chemical content. This opportunity could potentially provide new investigative leads, especially when the fingermark comparison and match process fails. We have demonstrated that Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry and Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) can provide multiple images of the same fingermark in one analysis simultaneous with additional intelligence. Here, a review on the pioneering use and development of MALDI MSI for the analysis of latent fingermarks is presented along with the latest achievements on the forensic intelligence retrievabl...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is centred {{on the notion}} of landscape as a construct of marginal and multiple dialogues. It is a project that originates from a rediscovered family album of photographs of the Latin American landscape {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century. In particular those that centre on the Paraná River in Argentina, a place where myth, recent history of the Desaparecidos (those ‘disappeared’ by the military junta 1976 - 1983) and memory collide. These early analogue photographs of the river have sparked a series of creative interventions that explore the interstices between photography and printmaking, fragmenting the initial image in order to create new hybrid photographic prints using photo-etching and photo-transfer processes. The return of the material to the flat surface of the digital is of critical concern, as the ‘uncanny’ surface is turned into a haptic object more in keeping with printmaking practices and early pictorial photographs. This leads to questions about their affective resonance, as touch and ‘noise’ return to the surface of the print as a resistance and response to discourses of acceleration and forgetting. The theoretical and practical methodology is cyclical, and the layers of discourse appear both in the printed outcomes and in the multiple voices I use to discuss the project in writing. In the ruined surface of the analogue image, therefore, a new ruination occurs, as I develop my photographic plates in situ, in the waters of the river itself. In the encounter with the landscape, the forensic traces of Argentina’s political disappeared, now part of an on-going forensic anthropological investigation, create <b>latent</b> <b>marks</b> on the surface of the photographic plates. These invisible fragments serve to embed disruptive historical narratives into the print outcomes, as the river acts as the site of convergence for these multiple histories. These geographical and metaphorical bodies of water, distorted, disappeared and ‘ruined’ both by a history of dictatorship cover ups and the failings of memory, are able to reappear in this research, as latent and liminal imageobjects in an open-ended encounter with the multiple narratives of the river...|$|E

40|$|Fingerprints are a {{worldwide}} well known tool {{for law enforcement}} agencies to reach the individualization of people convicted of a crime. Moreover, all major countries have huge fingerprint databases and efficient automated systems (AFIS) to perform electronic screening of fingerprints marks recovered by crime scene investigation. Fingerprints are permanent and even if, from a scientific point of view, {{they could not be}} considered unique, friction ridge is highly selective and allows a discrimination between different individuals with a very high proficiency. Up to now, the most common techniques for enhancing latent fingerprints from articles collected in the crime scene are based on chemical-physical processes, or optical detection techniques, based on absorption, photoluminescence, diffused reflection or ultraviolet imaging, with appropriate band-pass and/or narrow-band filtering. Chemical-physical processes have shown really good performances, but they are destructive with respect to the <b>latent</b> finger <b>mark</b> deposit and in most cases these methods partially affect subsequent DNA analysis. On the other side, optical detection processes have the advantage of being non-destructive of the fingerprint. As a result, these techniques allow later performing of DNA analysis and/or the further application of conventional fingerprint development procedures. The majority of the optical techniques, {{with the possible exception of}} the ultraviolet inspection, allow further biological analysis. And as the aforementioned methods have the advantage of being non alterative with the respect of the fingerprint deposit, subsequent application of chemical and/or physical methods is not precluded. Moreover, some recent studies are investigating the X-ray fluorescence of fingerprints, and some others are attempting to discriminate the IR spectrum of the finger mark deposit from the IR spectrum of the surface. It is easy to understand how crucial is to develop a robust technique of optical analysis, able to reach a high-resolution imaging of finger marks, requiring no chemical conventional or non-conventional pre-process and producing no modification either on the finger perspiration deposit or on the background surface. The proper image of the fingerprint, obtained from the item surface, could allow us to perform a complete fingerprint analysis, which potentially leads us to the individualization of the perpetrator. Moreover, fingerprint imaging could exactly point out the particular region of the whole surface where we can surely find the DNA of the donor, with a higher probability of successful analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{seasonal}} variation in carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy fluxes in a broad-leafed semi-arid savanna in Southern Africa using the eddy covariance technique. The open woodland studied consisted of an overstorey dominated by Colophospermum mopane with a sparse understorey of grasses and herbs. Measurements presented here cover a 19 -month period {{from the end}} of the rainy season in March 1999 to the end of the dry season September 2000. During the wet season, sensible and latent heat fluxes showed a linear dependence on incoming solar radiation (I) with a Bowen ratio (beta) typically just below unity. Although beta was typically around 1 at low incoming solar radiation (150 W m(- 2)) during the dry season, it increased dramatically with I, typically being as high as 4 or 5 around solar noon. Thus, under these water-limited conditions, almost all available energy was dissipated as sensible, rather than <b>latent</b> heat. <b>Marked</b> spikes of CO 2 release occurred at the onset of the rainfall season after isolated rainfall events and respiration dominated the balance well into the rainfall season. During this time, the ecosystem was a constant source of CO 2 with an average flux of 3 - 5 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1) to the atmosphere during both day and night. But later in the wet season, for example, in March 2000 under optimal soil moisture conditions, with maximum leaf canopy development (leaf area index 0. 9 - 1. 3), the peak ecosystem CO 2 influx was as much as 10 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1). The net ecosystem maximum photosynthesis at this time was estimated at 14 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1), with the woodland ecosystem a significant sink for CO 2. During the dry season, just before leaf fall in August, maximum day- and night-time net ecosystem fluxes were typically - 3 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1) and 1 - 2 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1), respectively, with the ecosystem still being a marginal sink. Over the course of 12 months (March 1999 -March 2000), the woodland was more or less carbon neutral, with a net uptake estimated at only about 1 mol C m(- 2) yr(- 1).

The ongoing terrorism gave a wake-up call to the establishment and untiring efforts were made for the establishing and proper functioning of the forensic laboratory to help criminal investigations (Petherick et al., 2009). Since 2001, authorities have been revamping forensic science infrastructure across the country to aid crime investigation. The National Forensic Science Agency (NFSA) was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) as an autonomous body in 2002 having departments of crime scene Investigation, trace chemistry, questioned documents and digital forensics (National Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). Its objective was to help establish other forensic science laboratories across the country and to provide teaching and training facilities throughout Pakistan, which is still not achieved. In Punjab province, Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) Act was passed on October 2007 for the establishment of the Forensic Science Agency which ultimately lead to the establishment of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency on 2012 having fourteen departments under one roof. The departments include audio video analysis, computer forensic unit, crime and death scene, DNA and serology, forensic photography, narcotics, toxicology, trace evidence, polygraph, firearm and tool <b>marks,</b> <b>latent</b> fingerprints, pathology and questioned documents (Punjab Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). In Sindh province, Sindh Forensic Science Agency act was passed on August, 2017 but so far no laboratory has been established. DNA testing facility available in Jamshoro, Sindh which provides research as well as forensic DNA testing. Besides this, government of Sindh is making efforts for establishment of Forensic DNA testing laboratory in Karachi University. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police has established Forensic Science Laboratory and Institute of Forensic Science in Peshawar on December, 2017 to provide preliminary forensic facilities and {{to bridge the gap between}} forensic awareness and criminal investigation practices. In Balochistan province of Punjab, an act was passed for the establishment of Balochistan Forensic Science Agency on August, 2015 but no forensic facility has yet been established. At present, NFSA and PFSA are providing many important investigation leads in various hideous crimes. The advent of DNA data base recently at PFSA has proved a major breakthrough in solving crimes through DNA profile comparison, not only exonerating the innocent, but also in catching the real culprit (Punjab Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). Now general public and judiciary of Pakistan are relying heavily on Forensic evidences in trial cases and making decisions.
