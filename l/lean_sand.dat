It is regarded by climbing historians as a historical 'snapshot' of the pioneering explorations of 'the first gritstone tigers'. It also disseminated information, and allowed {{the next generation of}} climbers to develop newer and harder routes. For example, it was in the hands of Piggot, Wood and Wilding in 1920 when they made the first ascents of <b>Lean</b> Man's Climb, <b>Sand</b> Buttress and Lone Tree Gully at Black Rocks.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{viability}} of oil sands aquatic reclamation techniques, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were stocked into three experimental ponds. Pond substrates consisted of either oil sands fine tailings or clay and <b>lean</b> oil <b>sands</b> deposited by the mining operations. Yellow perch were stocked immediately postspawning and subsamples were sacrificed at 5 and 11 months to measure indicators of energy storage and utilization. These indicators included survival, age, spawning periodicity, condition factor, gonad size, fecundity, and liver size. Indicators generally showed patterns consistent with improved energy storage and utilization in the experimental pond yellow perch as compared with yellow perch in the lake from which the stocked fish originated. This was evidenced by increased gonad size, condition factor, and Liver size and the disappearance of spawning periodicity. The patterns observed in experimental ponds suggest improved resource availability and (or) reduced intra- and interspecific competition. Yellow perch physiological indicators were also compared with those measured at several remote natural lakes in the area. Fisheries parameters measured in yellow perch from the experimental ponds generally fell {{within the range of}} those found in natural lakes...|$|R
40|$|Surface mining in the Athabasca {{oil sands}} region of Northern Alberta, Canada, {{results in the}} {{disturbance}} of significant areas of boreal forest landscape. The Aurora Soil Capping Study is a reclamation research project that aims to find the optimal soil capping (cover) material and thickness to re-establish a boreal forest ecosystem above a <b>lean</b> oil <b>sands</b> (LOS) disposal area at Syncrude's Aurora North mine. The objectives of this laboratory and field-based study are to (1) characterize the in-situ hydrocarbon composition of the LOS material, (2) {{determine the effect of}} temperature on rates of gas flux and the biodegradation potential of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) as a result of microbial activity and (3) determine the potential for PHC to leach into the groundwater system. The results of the laboratory-study show that temperature has a significant effect on the rate of PHC degradation as indicated by the linear relationship observed between temperature and CO 2 gas flux rates. The respiratory results from the laboratory-based study were consistent and relatively comparable with data from the field study, which indicates that the column study could be useful in estimating in situ PHC degradation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1860 a {{hurricane}} swept {{the coast and}} destroyed some lighthouses, but not the Biloxi Lighthouse. Keeper Reynolds reported that she kept the light burning through the storm and [...] "faithfully performed the duties of Light Keeper in storm and sunshine attending it. I ascended the Tower at and after the last destructive storm when man stood appalled at the danger I encountered." [...] During a storm in 1860, {{a portion of the}} sand under the lighthouse eroded away, causing the structure to <b>lean.</b> Later more <b>sand</b> was removed from the opposite side to correct this. Local authorities ordered that the light be extinguished on June 18, 1861. The light was repaired and returned to service by November 15, 1866. At that time the tower was reported to have been painted with coal tar to protect it from rust, not, as has been reported, to mourn the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.|$|R
40|$|Naphthenic acids {{are known}} to be the most {{prevalent}} group of organic compounds in oil sands tailings-associated waters. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were exposed for four months to oil sands-influenced waters in two experimental systems located on an oil sands lease 30 km north of Fort McMurray Alberta: the Demonstration Pond, containing oil sands tailings capped with natural surface water, and the South Bison Pond, integrating <b>lean</b> oil <b>sands.</b> Yellow perch were also sampled from three lakes: Mildred Lake that receives water from the Athabasca River, Sucker Lake, at the edge of oil sands extraction activity, and Kimowin Lake, a distant reference site. Naphthenic acids were measured in perch muscle tissue using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bile metabolites were measured by GC-MS techniques and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection at phenanthrene wavelengths. A method was developed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to evaluate naphthenic acids in bile. Tissue analysis did not show a pattern of naphthenic acids accumulation in muscle tissue consistent with known concentrations in exposed waters. Bile fluorescence and LC-HRMS methods were capable of statistically distinguishing samples originating from oil sands-influenced waters versus reference lakes. Although the GC-MS and HPLC fluorescence methods were correlated, there were no significant correlations of these methods and the LC-HRMS method. In yellow perch, naphthenic acids from oil sands sources do not concentrate in tissue at a measurable amount and are excreted through a biliary route. LC-HRMS was shown to be a highly sensitive, selective and promising technique as an indicator of exposure of biota to oil sands-derived naphthenic acids...|$|R
40|$|The {{microporosity}} {{structure of}} soil provides important information {{in understanding the}} shear strength, compressibility, water-retention ability, and hydraulic conductivity of soils. It is a soil characteristic that depends on sample preparation method and wetting-drying history. A comprehensive study of the microporosity structure of a <b>lean</b> clay with <b>sand</b> was conducted in this research to investigate variations of the microporosity structure during compaction, saturation, and drying processes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the microporosity structure of soil sample surfaces. Mercury intrusion porosimetry {{was used to measure}} the microporosity structure quantitatively by showing the relationship between cumulative pore volumes and pore radius. The experimental results show that a dual-porosity structure (i. e., inter-aggregate pores and intra-aggregate pores) forms during the compaction process. The interaggregate pores are compressible and the associated volume is closely related to the final void ratio of the compacted sample. Changes to interaggregate pores is dominant during compaction, but changes to intra-aggregate pores is dominant during saturation and drying. Based on the experimental results, a dual-porosity structure model was developed by relating the pore-size distribution to the void ratio. Consequently, the pore-size distribution at any void ratio can be predicted...|$|R
40|$|Large above-grade {{overburden}} landforms {{comprised of}} low-grade <b>lean</b> oil <b>sands</b> (LOS) are amassed during the surface mining of oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada. Reclamation soil covers consisting of locally-salvaged soils are subsequently placed above the LOS landforms in single and multi-layered configurations. The soil covers {{are intended to}} 1) provide sufficient pore-gas O 2 to facilitate the growth of native boreal forest vegetation and to 2) oxidize methane (CH 4) produced in the anaerobic zones of the LOS before being exhausted to the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Prior to covering the LOS with soil covers, rates of CO 2 efflux {{from the surface of}} the LOS to the atmosphere ranged from 0. 1 - 7. 1 kg/m 2 /a. Pore-gas concentrations within the uncovered LOS ranged from 0 - 18 % for oxygen (O 2), 3 - 21 % for carbon dioxide (CO 2), and 0 - 12 % for CH 4. Following placement of soil covers, peak rates of CO 2 efflux were 2. 3 kg/m 2 /a {{from the surface of the}} soil covers to the atmosphere and 1. 8 kg/m 2 /a from the LOS into the soil covers. Peak rates of O 2 influx from the atmosphere through the soil covers was 18 kg/m 2 /a. Pore-gasses within the overlying soil covers and uppermost LOS were typically below the threshold that poses a risk to the survivability of reclamation vegetation, > 10 % O 2 and 16 %. Rates of CH 4 oxidation were quantified in batch soil column experiments for the soil cover materials and LOS in single and multi-layered configurations. Oxidation rates were sensitive to variations in temperature, moisture content, and bulk density. The results of the column experiments indicate that CH 4 generated deeper than 2 m within the LOS landform will be partially oxidized in both the soil covers and uppermost LOS horizon. Statistical analyses and finite difference numerical modelling were conducted to guide mine operators regarding practical issues involving the construction of LOS landforms, design of soil cover systems, and management of reclamation sites. Based on these exercises, it appears that the characteristics of the LOS landform are more important to pore-gas dynamics than the design of the soil cover systems...|$|R
40|$|The Aurora Soil Capping study, {{located in}} {{northern}} Alberta, was constructed to evaluate reclamation practices on <b>lean</b> oil <b>sands</b> dumps. The challenges relating to its success includes determining the appropriate soil cover design(s) for the coarse textured reclamation soil, while utilizing available salvaged natural soils, {{some of which}} contain residual bitumen {{in the form of}} aggregate oil sand material (AOSM). Limited research on this material raises key questions as to the impact it will play on transport and retention processes, along with potential contamination from hydrocarbon leaching. The research conducted sought to answer these questions. This thesis describes laboratory studies conducted on four soils; the upper organic LFH layer, Bm, BC and subsoil material while varying the amount of AOSM and implementing layering schemes. Material characterization through organic carbon and particle size analysis as well as hydrophobicity studies on AOSM through contact angle analysis were performed. A tension table and pressure plates, along with columns equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry probes, were used for water retention studies. Hydraulic conductivity was measured through constant head methods. To address hydrocarbon leaching concerns, chloride tracer studies were performed and the column outflow was analyzed using Gas Chromatography to detect the hydrocarbon type and concentration. Results from water retention and hydraulic conductivity studies indicated that although the AOSM was hydrophobic, its placement at varying concentrations and forms did not create consistent significant differences in the amount of moisture retained or transported. Results from the column studies showed that under steady state and transient conditions AOSM could result in decreasing infiltration rates and increasing chloride retention. The integration of soil layers further slowed the infiltration rate and delayed chloride transport. Under saturated conditions the presence of higher concentrations of AOSM appeared to increase the rate of water movement. Although these differences were minimal, further studies are required to explore this behavior. Overall, it can be concluded that with appropriate material placement, the addition of layering schemes and hydrocarbon material, the potential exists to increase soil water content in the upper layers of the soil, thereby increasing soil water storage for plant use...|$|R
40|$|A {{cover with}} {{capillary}} barrier effects (CCBEs) is a promising final cover for controlling water infiltration into a waste containment system. A CCBE {{consisting of a}} layer of fine soil and a layer of coarse soil relies on the particle size contrast of the two soils. Although CCBEs have been successfully used in dry climate, their performance under high precipitation intensities and high evaporation conditions (e. g., in South China) is still unclear. This paper aims to evaluate {{the performance of the}} CCBE in high-precipitation areas and propose appropriate combinations of local soils for constructing a CCBE in South China. Several combinations of <b>lean</b> clay, clayed <b>sand,</b> and silty sand with gravel are examined using saturated/unsaturated seepage analysis. Two contrasting conditions, i. e., a drizzle lasting {{for a long time and}} an intense storm lasting for a short time, are applied to the covers. The covers perform well when subject to prolonged small rainfall at an initial maximum suction of 150 kPa. When subject to a short-time heavy rainfall, breakthrough occurs in the cover consisting of clayed sand overlying silty sand with gravel. Of the three covers, a CCBE consisting of lean clay overlying silty sand with gravel performs well under both prolonged light rainfall and short time heavy rainfall conditions. This CCBE has the longest period of time before breakthrough and the least amount of percolated water under prolonged heavy rainfall. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} the smallest {{details of that}} afternoon. We landed on a bit of white beach. It was backed by a low cliff wooded on the brow, draped in creepers to the very foot. Below us the plain of the sea, of a serene and intense blue, stretched with a slight upward tilt to the thread-like horizon drawn {{at the height of}} our eyes. Great waves of glitter blew lightly along the pitted dark surface, as swift as feathers chased by the breeze. A chain of islands sat broken and massive facing the wide estuary, displayed in a sheet of pale glassy water reflecting faithfully the contour of the shore. High in the colourless sunshine a solitary bird, all black, hovered, dropping and soaring above the same spot with a slight rocking motion of the wings. A ragged, sooty bunch of flimsy mat hovels was perched over its own inverted image upon a crooked multitude of high piles the colour of ebony. A tiny black canoe put off from amongst them with two tiny men, all black, who toiled exceedingly, striking down at the pale water: and the canoe seemed to slide painfully on a mirror. This bunch of miserable hovels was the fishing village that boasted of the white lord's especial protection, and the two men crossing over were the old headman and his son-in-law. They landed and walked up to us on the white <b>sand,</b> <b>lean,</b> dark-brown as if dried in smoke, with ashy patches on the skin of their naked shoulders and breasts. Their heads were bound in dirty but carefully folded headkerchiefs, and the old man began at once to state a complaint, voluble, stretching a lank arm, screwing up at Jim his old bleared eyes confidently. The Rajah's people would not leave them alone; there had been some trouble about a lot of turtles' eggs his people had collected on the islets there--and leaning at arm's-length upon his paddle, he pointed with a brown skinny hand over the sea. Jim listened for a time without looking up, and at last told him gently to wait. He would hear him by-and-by. They withdrew obediently to some little distance, and sat on their heels, with their paddles lying before them on the sand; the silvery gleams in their eyes followed our movements patiently; and the immensity of the outspread sea, the stillness of the coast, passing north and south beyond the limits of my vision, made up one colossal Presence watching us four dwarfs isolated on a strip of glistening sand.|$|R
