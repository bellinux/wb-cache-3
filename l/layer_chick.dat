40|$|Abstract: The Participatory Livestock Development Project (PLDP) {{has been}} {{implemented}} in Bangladesh for the alleviation of poverty through livestock production, employment, income generation and intake of nutrition in rural people. The management and disease problems with cost-benefit {{analysis of the}} <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> rearer package programme of the PLDP have been evaluated in randomly selected 10 <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> rearing units (n= 3100 chicks) from day-old chicks up to 60 days to marketing of Muktagacha areas {{in the district of}} Mymensingh during the period from August to December 2002. It appears from {{the results of this study}} that 12. 87 % chicks died within 60 days of age inspite of chick reared in intensive management system and provided vaccines against common infectious diseases. The diagnosed diseases associated with mortality of chicks included infectious bursal disease (37. 6 %), coccidiosis (13. 28 %), chronic respiratory disease (13. 28 %) and other conditions (35. 84 %). The highest mortality rate (37. 6 %) in layer chicks, caused by infectious bursal disease (IBD), which were double vaccinated with Nobilis ® Gumboro D- 78 vaccines (Intervet) that indicates vaccination failure against IBD which deserve further investigation. Cost-benefit analysis of the outcome of the 10 <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> rearing units varied, and it was found loss in one unit (- 3. 17 %) and the highest profit of 45. 66 % with an average profit of 27. 33 %. However, profit was recorded in all the <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> rearing units except one unit due to outbreak of IBD which could be due to vaccination failure. Therefore, it may be concluded from the results of this study that the ‘layer chick rearer package programme ’ could be economically prospective for the alleviation of poverty of rural people if the major infectious diseases of poultry are controlled in Bangladesh...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} determine the effects of feeding high dietary fiber on the performance, cecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration and cecal microbial ecology of broiler and layer chicks. All diets were formulated to meet or exceed NRC (1994) standards for starter chicks with the lower fiber diet based on corn-soybean meal (SBM) and the higher fiber diet formulated using corn-SBM-dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and wheat bran. The higher fiber diet contained 60. 0 g/kg of both DDGS and wheat bran from 1 - 12 d and 80. 0 g/kg of both DDGS and wheat bran from 13 - 21 d. The experiment utilized a completely randomized design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments consisting of two dietary concentrations of fiber (lower and higher fiber) and two chicken lines (broiler and layer) fed from 1 to 21 d. The Ross 308 broiler chicks and Hy-line W 36 male chicks were housed in battery cages in an environmentally controlled room with ad libitum access to feed and water. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed efficiency (FE) were calculated over the 1 - 12 and 1 - 21 d feeding periods. Excreta samples were collected at the end of the experiment to determine nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) and Neutral Detergent fiber (aNDF) digestibility. Cecal samples were collected at the end of the experiment to determine SCFA concentration and microbial ecology. The results indicate that the higher dietary fiber diet significantly reduced broiler ADG for the 1 - 12 d and 1 - 21 d periods, but had no effect on <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> ADG resulting in a significant interaction (P 2 ̆ 6 le 0. 01). Neutral detergent fiber digestibility was higher in layer chicks in comparison to broiler chicks regardless of the diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), and higher dietary fiber concentration resulted in increased ileal (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and total track (P 3 ̆c 0. 02) aNDF disappearance, across both lines. Although aNDF disappearance was altered between line and diet, AMEn was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 41), suggesting that dietary energy was not limiting growth performance. Cecal short chain fatty acid analysis showed an increase in the concentration of acetic acid (P= 0. 02) and propionic acid (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in broiler chicks in comparison to layer chicks and increasing dietary fiber resulted in a significant reduction of butyric acid (P= 0. 03). There was variation in the cecal microbial communities as a result of chick line and diet modification. These results suggest that high fiber feed ingredients are suitable substitutes for supplementation in <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> starter diets but not in broiler chicks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Adequate {{environmental}} temperature control {{is essential for}} incubation efficiency. Layer breeder eggs (n= 360) were weighed and distributed in a completely randomized experimental design with two treatments, consisting of two incubation temperatures (T 1 = 37. 5 °C, control; and T 2 = 39. 0 °C, hot), with two incubators per temperature, and 90 eggs per incubator, totaling 360 eggs. Hatchability, embryo mortality, and chick cloacal and body surface temperatures were not affected by incubation temperature. Eggs incubated at the hot temperature presented greater egg mass loss and higher eggshell conductance than those incubated at the control temperature. <b>Layer</b> <b>chicks</b> derived from eggs incubated at control temperature showed greater absolute weight, yolk-free egg mass, and heavier hearts than those from eggs submitted to heat stress during incubation. The control group presented lower base excess and ionized calcium blood levels.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on the epidemiology and vector role of ticks in layer chicken in Faisalabad district of Punjab(Pakistan) For epidemiological studies, prevalence of ticks on layer chicken was determined by selecting eighteen layer farms oat random: 5, 5, 3, 3 and 2 layer farms from tehsil Faisalabad, Jarawala, Sammudri, Tandianwala and chak Jhumra, respectively. Different species of ticks were collected and identified from layers. Tick infestation in layers was correlated with different factors like temperature, humidity, variety of layers, age species of ticks and the used of acraicides. The vector role of fowl ticks in the transmission of diseases was explored. For this purpose, ticks were examined natural infection with spirochaetes, bacteria and rickettsia. The vector status of different species of ticks naturally infected with spirochaetosis was confirmed through experimental transmission in healthy birds. The vector role of Argas persicus and Argas vespertilionis in the transmission of spirochaetosis in layer chicken was confirmed through isolation of Borrelia anserine form naturally infected ticks. The rate of Borrelia anserine infection in Argas persicus and Argas vespertilionis was 72. 7 and 55 percent respectively. Borrelia anserine infection in fowl ticks on different varieties of <b>layer</b> <b>chick</b> was also recorded and found to be 54, 66 and 84 per cent in the Indigenous, Babcock and White Leg Horn layers, respectively. The transmission of spriochatetosis by fowl ticks was assessed by experimental transmission in the layer chicken.

Two experiments were carried out; using two hundred fifty broiler chicks (Lohmann) in the first experiment and two hundred fifty <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> (Bowan} in the second one. Ten recently hatched chicks were immediately selected from each strain at random, individually weighed and then killed. The yolk sac was removed from the abdominal cavity and then weighed. The remaining 240 chicks from both groups were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental groups as follows: (A) provided with water but no feed, (B) provided with feed but no water, (C) provided with neither feed nor water and (D) provided with both feed and water. Water and feed deprivation continued for 48 h posthatch. Thereafter, all the groups were provided with normal feed and water. Body weight and yolk sac weight were measured for successive 6 days. Statistical analysis was carried out using general linear model procedure of Statistical analysis system. The obtained data indicated that, there was strain difference between broiler and <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> in yolk sac weight at hatch.

For this purpose, livers were collected from <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> (n= 25), older layers (n= 25), broilers (n= 300), and livers (n= 25) and stool (n= 25) samples from broiler breeders, representing the major poultry regions of the state. FAdV DNA was demonstrated using a previously described PCR protocol for amplifying part of the hexon gene encoding sequence. FAdV was found in <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> (36 %), widespread (100 %) in older layers, and with regional differences in broilers (24 - 86 %). Although all broiler breeder stools were negative, FAdV DNA was detected in livers (16 %, 4 / 25) of stool-negative birds. In order to obtain additional information on the circulation of the infection, livers of subsistence chickens collected from one poultry intensive region, were evaluated (n = 12), with FAdV being detected in all samples. FAdV was found in young and old layers, broilers, broiler breeders and free-range chickens, and results suggest the circulation of FAdV among different types of chickens. The detection in older layer chickens may indicate an extended risk of horizontal transmission in regions of Minas Gerais with mixed activity of egg and meat type chickens and poor biosecurity strategies. The infection in breeders may indicate vertical transmission and the continuous production of infected progenies.

The distribution of orexinergic cell bodies and fibers within the hypothalamus of broiler chicks was identified using immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and orexin-B. Furthermore, the differences in the hypothalamic orexin mRNA concentrations during the day-night cycle and in feed and food restricted conditions were tested in broiler and <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> using RT-PCR. Orexin-ir neurons were showed in a hypothalamic paraventricular population that expands to the stratum cellulare externum. Orexin-ir fibers were seen in the all hypothalamus mainly located in periventicular and basal position. They were distributed between the immunopositive cells bath also intermingled between the immunonegative cells belonging to the n. magnocellularis preopticus, the n. supraopticus ventralis, the n. preopticus periventricularis, the nucleus suprachiasmaticus, the regio lateralis hypothalamus and surrounding the anterior commissure, the pallial commissure and throughout the infundibular region in the n. inferior hypothalami and n. infundibuli. In particular, orexins in the suprachiasmatic nucleus suggest that these peptides may have a role in the suprachiasmatic neuronal activity as demonstrated in other mammalian and non-mammalian species. For the first time orexin-ir fibers were seen in the anterior and posterior median eminence of chick. Here, they are located both in the zona interna and zona externa where they are close apposed to vessels of the portal vasculature. This suggests that orexins may be released in the portal circulation and may have influence on biosynthesis or the secretion of anterior lobe hormones as well as in mammals. No influence of day-night cycle on the expression of hypothalamic orexin mRNA was observed. Quantification of hypothalamic orexin-mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR shown <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> tended to express higher orexin mRNA compared to broiler chicks so, the gene related to orexin neuropeptides is impacted by the genetic selection practices and may play a role in breed-specific body weight setpoint regulation in the chicken The demonstration of increased hypothalamic orexin gene expression after food restriction in broiler probably reflect the involvement of orexins in mechanisms of adaptation to fluctuations in food availability to which the animals are submitted in their natural environment. In summary, our anatomical and physiological results have furthered our understanding of orexin circuit in the neuroendocrine regulation in the hypothalamo-hypophysial tract and in the control of several autonomic functions and behavior. Our findings don’t support the involvement of orexins neither in sleep/wake cycle nor in food intake directly but rather in the linking energy balance and arousal...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{administration}} of calf thymus extract (CTE) with protein concentration of 1. 8 mg/ml was studied using {{two groups of}} day old <b>layer</b> <b>chicks.</b> Both the groups were vaccinated with ‘F’ and ‘R 2 B’ strains of New Castle Disease Virus (NDV) vaccines on 7 th day and 8 th week respectively. One group was administered with 1. 8 mg of thymic proteins intraperitoneally, one week prior and one week after each vaccination. The other group remained as vaccinated control group. Humoral and cell mediated responses were evaluated 15 days after each vaccination. Intraperitoneal administration of calf thymus extract markedly and significantly increased the antibody titres against NDV, serum globulin level, and percentage of lymphocytes in the blood. In addition thymus extract resulted in definite and significant cellular immunopotentiation...|$|R
40|$|In young chicks, L-carnitine supplementation {{during the}} starter stage {{may lead to}} faster {{utilization}} of yolk sac content and hence improvement of juvenile performance. To evaluate possible dose effects of L-carnitine supplementation in drinking water on juvenile layer-type chick performance, a total of 684 Hisex Brown <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> were studied. The chicks were divided into three groups of 228 chicks each, namely 1) control group (Cont), 2) chicks with supplementation of 30 mg of L-carnitine per liter of drinking water (LC 30) and 3) chicks with supplementation of 60 mg of L-carnitine per liter of drinking water (LC 60). Within each group, chicks {{were divided into two}} replications of 114 each and were reared up to 14 d of age. Sample of chicks used to collect blood and to weigh yolk sac at 1, 7 and 14 d of age. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} the {{unexpected}} {{discovery of a}} new virus in samples from chicken and turkey flocks with clinical disorders such as tenosynovitis, enteric problems, or runting and/or stunting-like problems. Since 1987, several virus isolation attempts on samples from these flocks resulted in the same, macroscopic characteristic lesions in embryonated SPF eggs, being mortality with bright red discoloration of legs and wing-tips, a swollen dark-red liver and oedema. Initial work showed characteristics of a non-enveloped RNA virus. Further work, which is described in this paper, showed that the isolated strains formed {{a new group of}} avian nephritis viruses (ANV), which is genetically and antigenically distinct from known avian astroviruses (AAstVs). Inoculation of a representative strain (isolate 19) of this new group of ANV, provisionally named avian nephritis virus- 3 (ANV- 3), in SPF <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> resulted in diarrhea, runting and stunting and even mortality...|$|R
40|$|Provision of feed in the {{immediate}} posthatch period may influence interaction between intestinal microbiota and immune system, and consequently immunological development of the chick. This study addressed ileal immune development in response to early feeding in 2 chicken breeds selected for different production traits: broilers and <b>layers.</b> <b>Chicks</b> of both breeds either received feed and water immediately posthatch or were subjected to a 72 -h feed and water delay. Ileal cytokine and immunoglobulin mRNA expression levels were determined at different time points. Effects of early feeding were limited, but breeds differed strikingly regarding cytokine and immunoglobulin expression levels. Cytokine expression levels in broilers were low compared with layers and showed a transient drop in the second to third week of life. In contrast, broilers showed considerably higher expression levels of IgA, IgM, and IgY. These findings indicate that the 2 breeds use different immune strategies, {{at least on the}} ileal level...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 63 day-old {{straight}} run <b>Layer</b> <b>chicks</b> up to 45 weeks of age on 3 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets D 1 (6 % PC+ 0 % SWP), D 2 (0 % PC+ 6 % SWP), and D 3 (0 % PC+ 8 % SWP) were fed {{to observe the}} effect of dietary SWP on growth and egg production performance. This study revealed that profitability, growth and egg production performance of RIR pure line were significantly (P< 0. 01) higher in D 2 dietary treatment groups as compared to D 1 and D 3 treatment. No significant difference (P< 0. 05) in livability was found which {{could be attributed to}} the dietary SWP levels. Feed cost/kg was gradually declined on increasing dietary levels of SWP. The efficiency by the birds receiving SWP were better as compared to the control. The result of this study demonstrated that cheaper SWP could be an excellent substitute of costly protein concentrate in formulating diets for layers leading to increase profitability...|$|R
40|$|The Animal welfare {{science is}} mostly focused on {{evaluating}} {{and improving the}} quality of life of animals that actually exist. This leaves out a range of ethically relevant issues regarding the quantity of life – in terms of number of animals living and the longevity of each animal. In many cases quantity and quality are related, and often there is a tension between the two. In this chapter, we develop a discussion around four practical cases presenting quality-quantity dilemmas: a) the issue of dairy cow longevity, b) the early slaughter of male dairy calves, c) the killing of newly-hatched male <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> and d) the conflict between reduction and refinement in animal research. The practical, economic and animal welfare aspects characterizing each case are presented together with relevant stakeholders’ perspective. We discuss the cases in light of the most relevant currents of thought in animal ethics, highlighting the main values at stake and which possible solutions may be sought according to each perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the histo-morphological changes resulting from different fasting periods before {{the collection of}} tissue samples in different segments of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) of 7 -d-old male chicks of a broiler and a layer strain. A completely randomized experimental design in in a 2 x 7 factorial arrangement, being two strains with different growth rates (Ross 308 and HyLine® W 36) and seven fasting periods (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours), with six replicates, totaling 84 birds. The comparison of the morphometrics of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of broiler and <b>layer</b> <b>chicks</b> demonstrated faster digestive tract development in broilers relative to layers. The fasting period caused morphological changes in the liver and small and large intestines in both strains. Therefore, it must be highlighted that in studies involving organ weights and intestinal morphometrics, birds must not be submitted to fasting before tissue collection...|$|R
