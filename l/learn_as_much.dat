5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things}} that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

500|$|Cooney's study, titled [...] "Television for Preschool Education", {{spelled out}} how {{television}} {{could be used}} to help young children, especially from low-income families, prepare for school. [...] The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. [...] At the same time, they wanted to make the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as children with more educational opportunities. [...] This was the show's primary criterion for success.|$|E

500|$|Rigbey {{also wanted}} to make sure that {{everyone}} liked the character, and eventually nineteen year old, agricultural student Ruth Pritchard was created. Actress (later presenter) Felicity Finch was cast as Ruth. Finch had not listened to The Archers prior to her audition in 1987 and she tried to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as she could about the history of the show before she came to the studio. Smethurst thought the decision to cast a Geordie was [...] "odd" [...] and wrote that it harked back to the days when the show would cast lots of Scottish and Irish actors, irritating the audience. Finch's first scenes as Ruth were broadcast on 15 July 1987.|$|E

In February 2013, in an interview with Marca, Jesé spoke out against his lack of senior game, stating that he was confident he was doing well enough to be granted an opportunity and, while he tried to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could from Mourinho, he was a manager who surrounded himself with players who had already made their name. Club chairman Florentino Pérez and B-side coach Alberto Toril both defended Jesé for his comments, although the latter advised that he should learn to control his emotions.|$|E
500|$|Georgene L. Troseth and {{her colleagues}} at Vanderbilt University studied how {{toddlers}} use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references. Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about {{how to find a}} toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like Blue's Clues, which although was [...] "on the right track" [...] due {{to the way in which}} the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from Blue's Clues to solve new problems. Her research suggested that Blue's Clues engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction. A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to Blue's Clues to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.|$|E
500|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. [...] Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic L'armonia della religione colla civiltà, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, [...] "blesse the servant who baptised him," [...] and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: [...] "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope." ...|$|E

500|$|Walt Disney {{strongly}} encouraged Costa to {{work closely}} with Davis while he animated Aurora so that she could <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible about her character and familiarize herself with [...] "all aspects of her." [...] Drawing Aurora to resemble her voice actress, Davis incorporated Costa's habit of gesturing with her hands while speaking and singing into the character's design, and defended the singer's performance when it was incorrectly referred to a voice-over by a fan, explaining that Costa's voice was [...] "the ocean of sound upon which we animated." [...] Davis and Costa eventually became close friends. Actress and dancer Helene Stanley served as the live-action model for Aurora, providing visual reference for the animators. The performer was recruited due to the high degree of realism required to animate Aurora. Stanley's costume was designed by costume designer Alice Estes at the behest of Davis, then a student of the animator at Chouinard Art Institute. To compliment the [...] "tapestry pattern" [...] of the film's backgrounds, Estes agreed to design the dress to [...] "move like [...] was animated." [...] Estes and Davis eventually got married. Meanwhile, British actress Audrey Hepburn served as Oreb's inspiration for Aurora's body type, from whom they borrowed the princess' [...] "elegant, slender features". The studio disagreed about whether Aurora's gown should be pink or blue, a conflict that was written into the film {{in the form of an}} argument between Flora and Merryweather. Aurora has a total of only 18 minutes of screen time.|$|E

But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy."
