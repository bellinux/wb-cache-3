5|$|In Autumn 2013, the Ustinov {{presented}} The Spanish Golden Age Season, {{three new}} translations of rarely seen plays. These included the tragedy Punishment without Revenge, and the romantic comedies Don Gil of the Green Breeches and A Lady of <b>Little</b> <b>Sense,</b> which ran in repertory with {{a cast of}} ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013. It was later transferred to the Arcola Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and construction time. Their hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished. They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out, {{but a number of}} years elapsed before that process was completed as <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> of urgency remained.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, Lafontaine {{ordered a}} retreat and Guderian finally got heavy {{artillery}} from the Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment. The 88mm dual role artillery guns and the heavier Panzer III and IVs reached {{the area of}} the battle. By this time, the French 7th Tank Battalion had been wiped out and the 213th Infantry Regiment had been devastated. Only 10 French tanks, out of 40, remained. In the two pitched battles the 7th Tank Battalion fought that day they lost 10 from 13. Delays on the right flank meant the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion did not reach their starting line until 10:45, by which time the battle on the left wing had been lost and further attacks on the right would have made <b>little</b> <b>sense.</b> The 1st Panzer Division's victory parade was held in Chemery at 12:00, but it was cut short when the Luftwaffe bombed the square by mistake inflicting a few casualties.|$|E

5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The generic {{flexible}} space {{structure is}} a flexible beam {{controlled by a}} single actuator at one end. The actuator is attempting to control the rotation and/or lateral translation of the entire flexible system from rest to rest, requiring a combination of position control and active bending vibration damping. A new control strategy is presented for this problem. It is based on viewing the actuators motion as simultaneously launching and absorbing mechanical waves {{into and out of}} the system. It requires <b>little</b> <b>sensing,</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of the flexible system dynamics, and makes small demands on the actuator dynamics. It is generic and easily handles an arbitrary number of system components of arbitrary inertias and stiffnesses. It leads to a controller that can get the entire system to stop dead exactly at target, with little vibration in transit...|$|R

25|$|However, {{evidence}} of Shakespeare's authorship {{has also been}} found within the play. For example, Samuel Johnson argued that the play was more competently written than King John, Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV and Henry V, and, therefore, not attributing it to Shakespeare based on quality made <b>little</b> <b>sense.</b> A similar point is made by Lawrence V. Ryan, who suggests that the play fits so well into Shakespeare's overall style, with an intricate integration of form and content, that it was most likely written by him alone.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{recommended}} to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years makes <b>little</b> <b>sense,</b> {{stating that the}} tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging, and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages.

25|$|Williams had {{neglected}} to tell Mansell that Prost had signed for 1993 at {{only the second}} race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt {{would be similar to}} their days together at Ferrari. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was just as intense as the one he had with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna's effort). Williams decided that there was <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand. With the original offer revoked, and with the premiere teams already committed to their incumbent drivers, Mansell decided to move on. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done; Mansell retired from F1.|$|E

25|$|John Burley's origins are obscure, {{not least}} because his name was not uncommon. Burley is a toponymic surname signifing a meadow or {{clearing}} by a fortified place and is found fairly widely across the Midlands and the North of England. He has been portrayed as a nephew of Simon de Burley, an influential courtier executed by the Merciless Parliament {{at the behest of}} the Lords Appellant. However, this makes <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> in view of John Burley's political position and apparent social origins. He seems to have been a son of a John Burley of Wistanstow in southern Shropshire and a nephew of John Burnell of Westbury, Shropshire. The lawyer John Burley is known from a quitclaim deed of 1397 to have had at that time three brothers: Nicholas, portioner of the church of Westbury, James and Edmund. There seems to have been pattern of having a lawyer and a cleric in each generation.|$|E
25|$|Meyer and Mooyer, who {{published}} {{the contents of}} the manuscript in 1833, comment that the copier and compiler seemed to have organized his materials haphazardly and all-too freely (even carelessly) adapted spelling to his own taste; a sixteenth-century editor corrected many errors in the manuscript's margins. Still, many lines appear to be missing and others make <b>little</b> <b>sense.</b> The manuscript was long thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the city library of Bremen. How it got there from Switzerland is unknown. A page is retained in the fragment of a collection c. 1380, written on paper in the Alsace and edited by Robert Priebsch; the fragment was in the collection of August Closs, which was bequeathed to the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies. Modern scholars of the poem cite it from Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen's Hundert altdeutsche Erzählungen (1850; republished 1961); a new edition was announced as part of a project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Edition und Kommentierung der deutschen Versnovellistik des 13. und 14. Jahrhunderts.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{itself was}} {{essential}} {{in the kind}} of operations the German Army and its allies were going to fight. In the Inter-War period, the Luftwaffe developed its communications, aircraft, training programs, and to an extent its logistics to support mobile operations. Its primary mission was not direct close air support, but operational-level interdiction. This entailed attacking enemy logistics, communications, and air bases. Air raids on Soviet war-making potential were forbidden by Hitler. It made <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> to destroy industry that would soon be in Axis hands; the OKW did not believe the Soviets could transport the industry to the Ural Mountains. Counter-air operations were considered most important. In order for the German Army and Luftwaffe bombers to operate effectively in their roles, the first task of the Axis was to eliminate the Soviet air force and deny the enemy the means to interfere with their operations. Once these operations had been carried out, close air support could be rendered to the army. This had always been a core tenet of Luftwaffe doctrine. Once the A-A line had been reached, the Luftwaffe was to destroy the surviving factories in the Urals.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{additional}} {{examples of the}} decree being issued during the later years of the Republic. The Oxford Classical Dictionary gives four more examples of the SCU: In 62 BC against Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos and Caesar, in 48 BC against Marcus Caelius Rufus, in 47 BC against Publius Cornelius Dolabella and in 40 BC against Salvidienus Rufus. Plaumann names the SCU of 47 BC as an exceptional case, since its addressee was Mark Antony, Caesar's magister equitum. Plaumann also writes about two SCUs in 88 BC, against public disturbances which were eventually resolved by Sulla. Another SCU could have been issued in 87 BC, when the consul Gnaeus Octavius acted against his colleague Lucius Cornelius Cinna. In 43 BC, after the assassination of Julius Caesar {{and the beginning of}} hostilities between Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, a total of four SCUs {{can be found in the}} sources, of which authors like Gerhard Plaumann, whose study on the subject is still considered canonical, can make <b>little</b> <b>sense.</b> The SCU against Salvidienus Rufus in 40 BC seems to have been a matter of pure obeisance towards the triumviri. It appears that the Principate with its higher political stability rendered the use of an emergency decree such as the senatus consultum ultimum obsolete.|$|E
25|$|KTVT {{was one of}} the few long-tenured major market independents {{that did}} not align with the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company in the run-up to the network's launch in October 1986. It, however, was {{eliminated}} from contention in becoming a Fox station from the start, as network parent News Corporation had purchased KRLD-TV (the former KNBN-TV, which would become KDAF) as part of its merger with Metromedia in May 1985, six months prior to the Rupert Murdoch-owned media company's announcement of the formation of the Fox network. KDAF and the other five former Metromedia stations served as the nuclei for the new network as the original members of the Fox Television Stations, its group of owned-and-operated stations. However, even without the presence of KDAF, KTVT would have likely passed on the Fox affiliation in any event. Most of the smaller markets that were within KTVT's vast cable footprint had enough commercial television stations to allow Fox to maintain an exclusive affiliation, meaning that it would have made <b>little</b> <b>sense</b> to have the station relay the network's programming to multiple markets located beyond the reach of its broadcast signal. In the late 1980s, the station relocated its operations to its current facility at 5233 Bridge Street, as a construction project that would widen the West Freeway into a four-lane highway forced KTVT to move from its original studios, which were torn down to make way for the additional freeway lanes.|$|E
