5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Later on September9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification {{gradually}} {{took place}} as the storm {{moved away from the}} Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September10. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September11. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140km/h (85mph) to 215km/h (135mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E

40|$|A tiltable, {{recirculating}} flume, 18 metres {{long and}} 76 cm. wide {{was used to}} investigate bedforms and structures near the transition between dunes and a plane bed for a moderately sorted, coarse sand. At Froude numbers ranging from about 0. 4 to 1. 0, three dune types developed: (1) asymmetrical (triangular) dunes, (2) convex (symmetrical) dunes and (3) humpback (whaleback) dunes. Asymmetrical dunes had gentle, long stoss sides and steep, short <b>lee</b> <b>sides</b> and contained cross-stratification with a maximum dip mostly about 30 degrees to 35 degrees. Flow separation and avalanching were strongly developed to the lee of these dunes. Convex dunes formed when the bed was thin and had longitudinal profiles that were convex-upward with stoss and <b>lee</b> <b>sides</b> of equal steepness. Internal cross-beds were likewise convex and formed from draping of sediment over the <b>lee</b> <b>sides</b> rather than from avalanching. Humpback dunes were the most distinctive bedforms in that on each dune profile the point of maximum elevation was offset {{from the top of}} the foreset (avalanche) slope. Immediately downstream from this maximum point, low-angle topset bedding merged uninterruptedly into steep foreset beds and these into bottomsets, producing sigmoidal bedding inside each dune. Although foreset slopes were much shorter in humpback dunes than in asymmetrical, their streepness remained mostly about 30 degrees to 35 degrees right up to the change to a plane bed at a Froude number of about 1. 1. For one other run a plane bed also formed but at a Froude number of about 1. 7, a rather high value for a plane bed just beyond the dune bed phase. This second plane bed may be that which occurs at Froude numbers larger than those for in-phase waves...|$|R
25|$|Other proa {{designers}} {{blur the}} lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally be more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place {{the bulk of the}} passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> to provide a greater righting moment.|$|E

[...] Around 2:00 pm, when Rodney felt certain that the ships seen were not the vanguard of a larger fleet, he issued commands for a general chase. [...] Rodney's instructions to his fleet were to chase at their best speed, and engage the Spanish ships from the rear as they came upon them. [...] They were also instructed to sail to the <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> to interfere with Spanish attempts to gain {{the safety of a}} harbour, a tactic that also prevented the Spanish ships from opening their lowest gun ports.

500|$|The {{high winds}} and heavy seas {{prevented}} {{the launching of}} any lifeboats and Davidson {{had decided not to}} abandon ship just yet in the faint hope that some passengers and crewmen might be able to swim ashore once the ship got closer. About a half hour after the collision, the British destroyer [...] appeared after searching for the convoy during the night. Despite Davidson's order to stand clear, Mounseys captain, Lieutenant Francis Craven, positioned his ship on Otrantos <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> to allow the men aboard the liner to jump aboard. Several times the two ships struck and the destroyer's hull was holed, her bridge smashed, two of three boiler rooms flooded, and many hull frames were broken by the force of the impacts. Nonetheless Craven kept his small ship close and was able to rescue 300 American troops, 266 officers and crewmen from Otranto, one YMCA morale officer and 30 French fishermen, although many more men had been washed from the decks or crushed between the two ships. Despite the weight of the rescued men and the damage sustained during the rescue, Mounsey was able to reach Belfast safely although she was too badly damaged to return to her own home port against the storm.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{non-traditional}} variant, {{first seen}} among Western yacht racers, the [...] "Atlantic proa" [...] has an ama {{which is always}} to the <b>lee</b> <b>side</b> to provide buoyancy for stability, rather than ballast as in a traditional proa.
