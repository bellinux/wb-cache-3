50|$|Although {{the strike}} call was province-wide, {{it was only}} in the city that it took general strike proportions. Numerous other strikes took place in the city that year, and the general strike was as much a show of <b>labour</b> <b>strength</b> as much as it was a {{political}} protest over Goodwin's death. War-time inflation reduced real income profoundly. Other factors such as the Bolshevik Revolution the previous year and the realization that capital profited immensely from the First World War while workers were cannon fodder fuelled the belief that labour deserved more than what employers were voluntarily willing to give. Although only one day in duration, the 1918 strike was thus an important marker in the Canadian labour revolt that peaked with the Winnipeg General Strike the following year. A 1919 Vancouver strike in sympathy with Winnipeg would be the longest general strike in Canadian history.|$|E
5000|$|Strauss’ victory, {{together}} {{with a number of}} other Liberal gains from the Conservatives which followed in the rest of 1927 and into 1928 led the Liberals to hope for a political revival, which it was believed would reap dividends at the next general election which was due by 1929. However, many Liberal analysts - including David Lloyd George - were cautious, worrying that a combination of three-cornered contests and growing <b>Labour</b> <b>strength</b> in industrial areas would weigh seriously against them under the first-past-the-post electoral system. Strauss himself spoke for those who had faith that revival had come. He felt the doomsayers had got it all wrong and shared a widespread Liberal hope that the electorate, disillusioned by the government of Stanley Baldwin yet unwilling to turn to the socialist ideas of Labour would rally to the Liberal cause. He wrote to one sceptic saying,”I cannot allow you to cast any doubt on the reality of the Liberal revival.” [...] The outcome of the 1929 general election saw the fears of the doubters realised however with only a limited increase in Liberal representation in the House of Commons and in Southwark North Strauss was unable to hold off a renewed challenge by Isaacs who took the seat by a majority of 432.|$|E

Eddisbury consists of mainly rural villages and small towns which are favourable to the Conservative party; <b>Labour's</b> only <b>strength</b> is in the constituency's largest town, Winsford, which currently has the seat's only local councillors. Labour fell from second to third place in the 2010 general election — the Conservative candidate held the seat with a majority of over 13,000 and a Liberal Democrat moved into second place.

50|$|Roderick {{proved to}} be an assiduous and active {{constituency}} member, campaigning to prevent further rail closures and the proposed creation of a reservoir which would entail the flooding of the Senni Valley. He also supported cheaper petrol for rural areas and was a pioneer of free public transport. <b>Labour's</b> main <b>strength</b> in the constituency lay in the industrial townships in its southern extremities, including Roderick's home village of Ystradgynlais. However, the party's hold on the constituency since 1945 also depended upon support in the rural areas and this became increasingly unstable in the 1970s. Roderick's majority fell to 2,277 at the General Election of February 1974 and only recovered to 3.012 in October when the party did much better nationally.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{temporal}} variation in partisan effects on social spending growth in OECD countries {{over the period}} 1971 – 2002. We argue that partisan effects are jointly conditioned by globalization and the mobilizational capacity of organized labour. We present three main empirical findings. First, we show that partisan effects increased from the mid- 1970 s to the late 1980 s and then dis- appeared in the 1990 s. Second, we show that partisan effects rose with globaliza- tion in the 1970 s and early 1980 s, a period characterized by rising <b>labour</b> <b>strength</b> in many OECD countries, {{but this is not}} true for the post- 1990 period, characterized by declining <b>labour</b> <b>strength.</b> Third, we show that globalization was associated with declining partisan effects in countries that experienced union decline in the 1980 s and 1990 s, but it was associated with rising partisan effects in countries in which unions remained strong...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} current {{strength}} of labour unions in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia and elaborates {{on the main}} factors {{that have led to}} the current situation. The first part of the paper includes an in-depth literature review of the current state-of-the-art in assessing the <b>labour</b> <b>strength</b> across Europe, with special emphasis on post-communist countries. The second part of the paper provides the assessment of labour union strength in the surveyed countries. The authors argue that there are significant differences in the roles of labour movements. Serbia and Slovenia quite differ, with extremely weak and extremely strong labour movements, respectively, while Croatia is located in between. Kosović and Copîl also elaborate on the causes of such weaknesses. They identify four main factors: communist legacy, nationalistic elites, economic crisis and foreign influence, and the lack of trust among citizens, and conclude {{that it is impossible to}} explain such a complex issue as <b>labour</b> <b>strength</b> by observing any of these factors separately. However, taken together, they all provide a quality explanation of the current union strength in the observed countries...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{speculation}} about the impact on family life of contemporary patterns of work has prompted considerable and concerted social research activity in which the workplace and household have figured prominently. This article extends these studies to examine employment in prototypical new sectors of the economy, namely call centres and software, {{which at the time}} of the study were enjoying spectacular growth. Employees in both sectors reported spillover from work to home, though the extent, nature and intensity of spillover varied significantly between the sectors. The study identified the different and hitherto unexplored ways in which employees in these different sectors attempt to cope with complex articulations between home and work, and the varying resources which they bring to bear in doing so. Contemporary work settings indicate little change from more established sectors in that gender, status and <b>labour</b> market <b>strength</b> are important factors in offering work boundary discretion...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an account of}} the recent introduction of a minimum wage in Hong Kong in 2011. Traditional welfare state theories had their origins in rich democracies. We refine the theoretical arguments in accordance with the semi-democratic nature of Hong Kong. We argue that the legislation was initiated reluctantly by the business-friendly government under unfavourable economic conditions. Any subsequent concessions to labour were not attributable to <b>labour</b> <b>strength</b> or political oppositions, which were very weak. Instead, multiple miscalculations by the politically dominant business side allowed the labour movement to gain limited grounds throughout the struggle. We also apply our arguments to the case of Singapore, illustrating how welfare state theories can be adapted to less democratic systems. © 2014 © 2014 Journal of Contemporary Asia.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ex post facto study was to {{determine}} explanatory variables for sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) yield among small, medium and large scale-growers at Ubombo Sugar, Swaziland. The target population of the census study was all small-medium-and large-scale-growers, milling their cane at the Big Bend Mill. Data were collected using valid and reliable questionnaires. The findings indicated that large-scale farmers obtained significantly higher yields than small and medium scale-growers. However, sucrose percentage was higher with small-scale than medium and large scale-growers. Production inputs and farming services were available, accessible, and affordable to all groups of sugarcane growers. Sugarcane growers were within the recommended delays in implementing the crucial planting and post harvest operations for sugarcane; and the man-days used per activity per hectare were within recommended practice. Explanatory variables for sugarcane yield were found to be distance between the farm and the mill; hand application of fertilizer man-days per hectare; and <b>labour</b> <b>strength.</b> Distance between the farm and the mill had a significantly negative influence on sugarcane yield. The research failed to reject the research hypothesis that good management and adequate production inputs increases sugarcane yield. The main conclusion was that, those farmers who were furthest from the mill should consider replacing sugarcane with other viable business ventures...|$|E
