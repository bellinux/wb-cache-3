40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{frequency}} of leadership transitions and their {{significant impact on}} team and organizational performance, little research has examined why and how teams develop an identification with a new leader or their subsequent receptiveness to the new leader’s change initiatives. Drawing from the contrast and congruence effects and the theoretical perspectives of leader identification, this study empirically tests a model in which the congruence of new leaders’ and their teams’ proactive personalities foster new leader identification, {{as well as the}} team’s behavioral responses to the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda.</b> This effect is strongest when the new leader’s proactive personality is higher than that of the former leader’s proactive personality (positive contrast). Our findings of a four-wave “before-and-after” transition survey of 155 hotel employees and 51 new leaders, achieved through polynomial regression analyses, proved very insightful. Essentially, we found that the congruence between a new leader’s and his/her team’s proactive personalities and the positive contrast between a former leader’s and the new leader’s proactive personalities enhanced new leader identification and the team’s shared identification with the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda,</b> and, thereby led the team to exhibit more behavioral engagement with, and voice behavior about, the new <b>leader’s</b> change <b>agenda...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The growing personalization of elections and the increased focus of media campaign coverage on party leaders is well-established in political science research. However, despite its importance for understanding these developments, intermedia party <b>leader</b> <b>agenda</b> setting has received little academic attention. Using extensive news media content data from the 2015 UK General Election, this paper examines the dynamics of intermedia agenda setting, assessing whether, and to what extent, the volume and tone of leaders’ media coverage flows between different platforms and outlets. Our analysis provides evidence of reciprocal influence between television, newspapers and radio. Their interactions, however, are complex and contingent on the characteristics and identity of both party leaders and media outlets. Altogether, our findings reveal no systematic convergence on the salience and tone of leaders’ news coverage, and cast doubts {{on the ability of}} the media to act as an independent force in personalizing electoral campaigns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study {{was to understand the}} client and occupational therapist experiences of a mental health group. A secondary aim was to explore the extent to which this group seemed to have reflected a client-centred approach. The topic emerged from personal and professional issues related to the therapist as teacher and to inconsistencies in practice with the profession's client-centred philosophy. This philosophy, the study's frame of reference, was established in terms of themes related to the client-therapist relationship and to client values. Typical practice was illustrated through an extensive literature review. Structured didacticexperiential methods aiming toward skill development were predominant. The interpretive sciences and, to a lesser extent, the critical sciences directed the methodology. An ongoing support group at a community mental health clinic was selected as the focus of the study; the occupational therapist leader and three members became the key participants. A series of conversational interviews, the. core method of data collection, was supplemented by observation, document review, further interviews, and fieldnotes. Transcriptions of conversations were returned to participants for verification and for further reflection Analysis primarily consisted of coding and organizing data according to emerging themes. The participants' experiences of group, presented as narrative stories within a group session vignette, were also returned to participants. There was a common understanding of the group's structure and the importance of having "air time" within the group; however, differences in perceptions of such things as the importance of the group in members' lives were noted. All members valued the therapeutic aspects of group, the role of group as weekly activity and, to a lesser extent, the learning that came from group. The researcher's perspective provided a critique of the group experience from a client-centred perspective. Some areas of consistency with client-centred practice were noted (e. g., therapist attitudes); however the group seemed to function far from a client-centred ideal. Members held little authority in a -relationship dominated by the <b>leaders,</b> and <b>leader</b> <b>agendas</b> rather than member values controlled the session. Possible reasons for this discrepancy ranging from past health care encounters through to co-leader discord emerged.

40|$|Revised for the American Political Science Review. September 2007. Abstract. Party activists wish to (i) {{advocate}} {{the best policy}} while (ii) unifying behind a party line. Activists learn about policy and the party line by listening to leaders. A leader’s influence increases with her judgement on policy (sense of direction) and her ability to convey ideas (clarity of communication). A leader with perfect clarity enjoys greater influence than one with a perfect sense of direction. When activists choose how much attention to pay to leaders they listen only to the most coherent communicators. However, attention-seeking leaders sometimes obfuscate their messages, but less so when activists emphasize party unity. Political scientists and commentators agree that good leadership is important, indeed fun-damental, to the successful performance of organizations. We have learned how <b>leaders</b> manipulate the <b>agenda</b> (Riker, 1996), serve as agents of their parties (Fiorina and Shepsle, 1989), and choose policies that enhance their survival (Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siver-son, and Morrow, 2003), but {{do not yet have}} answers to fundamental questions.

It also considers the role played by their political and institutional leaders in their retention.

40|$|Abstract This {{commentary}} {{describes how}} the Brazilian Ministry of Health's (MoH) research support policy fulfilled the National Agenda of Priorities in Health Research (NAPHR). In 2003, the MoH started a democratic process {{in order to establish}} a priority agenda in health research involving investigators, health managers and community <b>leaders.</b> The <b>Agenda</b> was launched in 2004 and is guiding budget allocations in an attempt to reduce the gap between scientific knowledge and health practice and activities, aiming to contribute to improving Brazilian quality of life. Many strategies were developed, for instance: Cooperation Agreements between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology; the decentralization of research support at state levels with the participation of local Health Secretariats and Science and Technology Institutions; Health Technology Assessment; innovation in neglected diseases; research networks and multicenter studies in adult, women's and children's health; cardiovascular risk in adolescents; clinical research and stem cell therapy. The budget allocated by the Ministry of Health and partners was expressive: US$ 419 million to support almost 3, 600 projects. The three sub-agenda with the higher proportion of resources were "industrial health complex", "clinical research" and "communicable diseases", which are considered strategic for innovation and national development. The Southeast region conducted 40. 5 % of all projects and detained 59. 7 % of the resources, attributable to the concentration of the most traditional health research institutes and universities in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The second most granted region was the Northeast, which reflects the result of a governmental policy to integrate and modernize this densely populated area and the poorest region in the country. Although Brazil began the design and implementation of the NAPHR in 2003, it has done so in accordance with the 'good practice principles' recently published: inclusive process, information gathering, careful planning and funding policy, transparency and internal evaluation (an external independent evaluation is underway). The effort in guiding the health research policy has achieved and legitimated an unprecedented developmental spurt to support strategic health research. We believe this experience is valuable and applicable to other countries, but different settings and local political circumstances will determine the best course of action to follow. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} contribute {{to our understanding of}} the role played by parties in the consolidation of democracy in the context of military tutelage and anti-system challenges. It finds that the conceptualization of parties under internal and external pressures in competitive party systems can be a useful framework to understand the constraints faced by parties in new democracies contemplating legal and constitutional reforms as a way to deepen democracy. The dual party framework focuses on the significance of the institutional (identity and party unity) and rational concerns of parties (electoral success) during democratization, at the same time that it integrates the role of the military in mediating the interplay between the internal and external challenges for parties. On the basis of the insights derived from the political party literature and democratization studies, the thesis identifies the formation of political identity as the major internal challenge for parties as they attempt to institutionalize themselves in the context of revitalized electoral competition. A politically autonomous military constitutes the principle external challenge for parties particularly in the presence of "anti-system" actors. The study then traces the formation and development of political identities by the three major Turkish parties that held power between 1983 and 1995. In particular, it analyzes how these pressures unfolded for party leaders as they confronted a controversial dilemma of reconciling democratization with the maintenance of stability due to the ethnic separatist threat, and to a lesser extent, religious fundamentalism. The study demonstrates that while the Turkish party <b>leaders</b> used democratization <b>agendas</b> as an image building' strategy in the formation of their parties' political identities, their capacity to formulate and implement clear, coherent and consistent democratization reform strategies was hampered by the problems they faced in meeting...|$|R
40|$|The Democrats are {{in control}} of the House of Representatives {{for the first time in}} 12 years, {{following}} their capture of 30 Republican-held House seats in the 2006 elections. In addition, the 100 th Congress includes 52 new members— 39 Democrats and 13 Republicans—and three Democrats who return to Capitol Hill after two years of involuntary sabbatical. The large freshman class, coupled with a change in party control undoubtedly will have a significant influence on the policymaking process, could reshape the caucus, and may well bring long lasting institutional change (e. g., see Polsby 2004; Rohde 1991; Sinclair 1989). Moreover, the large freshman class could field many of the next generation of party <b>leaders,</b> committee chairs, <b>agenda</b> setters, and dominating personalities. An examination of the career paths and personal characteristics of these new members may offer us some insight into the changes and continuities that we may observe in the 110 th Congress and beyond. 1 New Members: Democratic Holds The 12 new Democrats elected in districts previously held by a Democrat (or by Bernie Sanders) come to Capitol Hill with considerable experience in electoral politics, and many have had careers as accomplished legislators.

Consideration {{has been given to}} a range of potentially competing demands including the relationship between what Paul Luker describes as the 'core mission and values of HE' and what Caruana and Hanstock describe as 'marketisation discourse'. The Global University: The Role of Senior Manager is written by higher education institution senior managers, for HEI senior managers. Supported by HEFCE Leadership, Governance and Management Funding, 'The Global University: {{the role of}} senior managers' is a companion publication to 'The Global University: the role of the curriculum'. Many of the contributors are regarded as critical champions of internationalisation in the UK as well as thoughtful strategists in the process of affecting sustainable university-wide change. To provide further food for thought, in addition to the UK contributions, a case study on university-wide approaches to the development of global citizens at the University of British Columbia and a perspective on the barriers affecting the process of internationalisation in Latin American Universities have also been included. Contributors address key concepts from a variety of perspectives and what will quickly become apparent is that the terms are not always translated in quite the same way (a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing) but in spite of this, collectively, considerable insight for moving the agenda forward is provided. At the very least, the publication will serve to inspire debate on what should constitute the vision, mission and values of a global university, within the context of global society. Given the global footprint of universities and the ability of our graduates to influence change in global society, the publication maintains that universities cannot ignore their corporate and social responsibilities: senior managers have a critical role to play as <b>leaders</b> of this <b>agenda</b> and of change that results in positive benefits for a wider stakeholder group. ...|$|R

While political leaders acknowledge: “good policy, good votes” in social policy design and administration, {{the direction of}} redistributive targeting carries electoral implications, creating incentives to politicize distribution. This study utilizes a comparative framework to develop a theoretical model to explain targeted social policy choice in Latin American countries. It presents a systematic account of how programs are developed and politicized, and shows how they are a function of elements of horizontal accountability that affect how <b>leaders</b> pursue their <b>agenda.</b> To assess this theory, the project utilizes a mixed-method approach to examine cases in Brazil and Venezuela. To show the variation between programmatic and parochial social programs it examines expenditure patterns, program oversight, and tests of political and demographic determinants on program distribution to examine how programs with different levels of oversight are targeted. It then examines the effect of partisan powers {{on the design of}} programs, showing how horizontal accountability affects integration of reform elements that provide oversight and moderation of program design. To understand the electoral payoff of different targeted programs, it examines survey data to test effects of program participation on incumbent electoral support. This investigation reveals that leaders politicize targeted social programs by choosing distributional strategies, but are constrained in doing so by elements of horizontal accountability such as political competition and the institutionalization of the party system. The effects of these elements are shown in the cases and analysis of program distribution. Both programmatic and parochial distributive strategies have electoral effects, but the degree of effect varies. The quality of program outcomes varies too by distributive strategy. Better programs are the product of political interactions that affect the degree to which leaders can redistribute in a parochial manner. Evidence from Brazil and Venezuela shows variation in the politics, their outputs, the electoral effects, and program outcomes. The relationship of “good policy, good votes” is determined by “good politics” showing the effect of political institutions that constrain leaders from seeking “bad policy” and votes that follow...|$|R
