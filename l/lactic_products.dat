The carbohydrate fraction of soy is rich with the oligosaccharides causing an intestinal meteorism. Therefore topical issue about replacement of soy with perspective leguminous culture – the lupine, deprived of the shortcomings inherent in soy. The structure and physical and chemical properties of subcheese serum is presented. The method of calculation of the average sizes of particles of raw materials of a sphere having a geometrical form, the cylinder and an unlimited plate is received. Results of research of kinetics of extraction from a lupine are given at various geometrical form of raw materials.
