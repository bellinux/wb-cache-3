Its purpose {{is to provide a}} methodology of "how to integrate the capabilities between supplier and manufacturer, and to apply different strategies under the needs of quality improvements". This study is undertaken to specify the interaction and mutual movement among the three groups in the supply chain "Supplier-Manufacturer-Customer" and to integrate the results of four factors: incoming inspection, performance of <b>line</b> <b>reject,</b> service quality of supplier, and product reliability. It will attempt to transform these factors into measurable, quantitative, JIT (Just-In-Time) parameters, that are utilized in planning and establishing a rating system of supplier's performance focused on satisfying customers, both internal and external, which leads to the best value for money in acquiring materials and services...|$|E

50|$|The Italian Line {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Raffaello in April 1975, after the Italian Government {{announced that it would}} not further subsidize the ship (by 1975, it was paying 100 million lire per day, or about $151,500 at the then current exchange rate, to keep it sailing). Initially laid up in Genoa and later in La Spezia near the scrapyard, the Raffaello and the Michelangelo were inspected by several potential buyers such as Norwegian Cruise Line, Costa Amatori, Chandris Group, and Home Lines. The last even made a serious offer to buy the ships, despite large rebuilding costs, but the Italia <b>Line</b> <b>rejected</b> the offer.|$|R

60|$|In Mr. Wordsworth's {{criticism}} of Gray's Sonnet, the reader's sympathy with his praise or blame {{of the different}} parts is taken for granted rather perhaps too easily. He has not, at least, attempted to win or compel it by argumentative analysis. In my conception at least, the <b>lines</b> <b>rejected</b> as of no value do, {{with the exception of}} the two first, differ as much and as little from the language of common life, as those which he has printed in italics as possessing genuine excellence. Of the five lines thus honourably distinguished, two of them differ from prose even more widely, than the lines which either precede or follow, in the position of the words.|$|R

50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on {{a single pair of}} wires. A twisted pair <b>line</b> <b>rejects</b> electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|R

5000|$|With {{verdicts}} upon Nekrasov's legacy invariably {{depending upon}} the political views of reviewers, the objective evaluation of Nekrasov's poetry became difficult. As D.S. Mirsky noted in 1925, [...] "Despite his enormous popularity among the radicals and of a tribute given {{to him as a}} poet by enemies like Grigoryiev and Dostoyevsky, Nekrasov can hardly be said to have had his due during his lifetime. Even his admirers admired the matter of his poetry rather than its manner, and many of them believed that Nekrasov was a great poet only because matter mattered more than form and in spite of his having written inartistically. After Nekrasov's death his poetry continued to be judged along the party <b>lines,</b> <b>rejected</b> en bloc by the right wing and praised in spite of its inadequate form by the left. Only in relatively recent times has he come into his own, and his great originality and newness being fully appreciated." ...|$|R

50|$|A line {{connecting}} Goole to {{the rail}} network via Selby (Brayton) was put before parliament in 1845 ("Brayton and Goole Railway"), proposed by George Hudson and the York and North Midland Railway (Y&NMR); the <b>line</b> was <b>rejected</b> and another rival scheme, the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (later part of the L&YR) was accepted by parliament in the same year, becoming Goole's first rail link.|$|R
5000|$|A reject {{belt that}} {{provides}} a method of removing an out-of-tolerance package from the conveyor <b>line.</b> The <b>reject</b> can vary by application.

50|$|He saw {{the burning}} at Norwich, on 14 January 1589, of Francis Ket as an Arian. Burton {{testified to the}} {{apparent}} godliness of Ket's life and conversation, but is certain of his damnation. He also reports on the executions of Matthew Hamont (died 1579), John Lewes (died 1583) and Peter Cole (died 1587), all likewise burned. Burton took a Puritan <b>line</b> in <b>rejecting</b> ceremonies, but was firm against the Brownist separatists.|$|R
50|$|The first {{design for}} the new {{residential}} quarter {{was developed by the}} modernist and Bauhaus architect, Franz Ehrlich, in August 1950.

The same happened to the plan presented by the architects Kurt Junghanns and Otto Geiler. The plan that was ultimately realized was developed by Kurt Walter Leucht.|$|R
5000|$|The Court of Appeal upheld {{that the}} {{alteration}} in the sales agreement was merely an inquiry, {{and not a}} counter offer, making the original contract still enforceable against the vendor. Cooke J stated [...] "The <b>line</b> between <b>rejecting</b> an offer and merely inquiring as to a possible variation can be a fine one, but the basic test is the effect on a reasonable person in the shoes of the offerer".|$|R
40|$|Magnetic field {{lines are}} quantum objects {{carrying}} one quantum &Phi; 0 = 2 &pi;h/e of magnetic flux and have finite radius &lambda;m. Here {{we argue that}} they possess a very specific dynamical interaction. Parallel field <b>lines</b> <b>reject</b> each other. When confined to a certain area they form two-dimensional lattices of hexagonal structure. We estimate the filling factor of such an area. Anti-parallel field lines, on the other hand, attract each other. We identify the physical mechanism as being due to {{the action of the}} gauge potential field, which we determine quantum mechanically for two parallel and two anti-parallel field lines. The distortion of the quantum electrodynamic vacuum causes a cloud of virtual pairs. We calculate the virtual pair production rate from quantum electrodynamics and estimate the virtual pair cloud density, pair current and Lorentz force density acting on the field lines via the pair cloud. These properties of field line dynamics become important in collisionless reconnection, consistently explaining why and how reconnection can spontaneously set on in the field-free centre of a current sheet below the electron-inertial scale...|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} term, the Court would use Quantity of Books to bolster its holding against a state film-licensing system in Freedman v. Maryland, {{as one of}} several in which it had held that only an adversary hearing prior to {{restraint}} sufficed to protect First Amendment rights. Two years later, the Southern District of New York relied on the case to hold a federal seizure of obscene materials from a New York City bookstore unconstitutional, since it too had been insufficiently reviewed in advance. The next year, by contrast, Maryland district judge Roszel Cathcart Thomsen, hearing a bench trial of an man accused of transporting obscene materials across state <b>lines,</b> <b>rejected</b> his argument that the search of his vehicle which produced the two movies at issue had been unconstitutional under Quantity of Books. Thomsen distinguished the two cases with two factors: the Maryland one had involved materials stored in a vehicle rather than a warehouse, and, in it, the defendant was seeking merely to suppress them as evidence rather than contesting a forfeiture.|$|R
