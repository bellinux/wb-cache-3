Branch decompositions and branchwidth were introduced in 1991 by Robertson and Seymour and {{were used in the}} proof of Graph Minors Theorem (GMT), a well known conjecture (Wagner's conjecture) in graph theory. The notions of branchwidth and branch decompositions have been proved to be useful for solving many NP-hard problems that have applications in fields such as graph theory, network design, sensor networks and biology. Branch decompositions have been utilized for problems such as the traveling salesman problem by Cook and Seymour, general minor containment and the branchwidth problem by Hicks by means of the relevant branch decomposition-based algorithms. Branch decomposition-based algorithms are fixed parameter tractable algorithms obtained by combining dynamic programming techniques with branch decompositions. The running time and space of these algorithms strongly depend on the width of the utilized branch decomposition. Thus, finding optimal or close to optimal branch decompositions is very important for the efficiency of the branch decomposition-based algorithms. Motivated by the vastness of the fields of application, we aim to increase the efficiency of the branch decomposition-based algorithms by investigating effective techniques to find optimal branch decompositions. We present three integer programming models for the branchwidth problem. Two similar formulations are based on the relationship of branchwidth problem with a special case of the Steiner tree packing problem. The third formulation is based on the notion of <b>laminar</b> <b>separations.</b> We utilize upper and lower bounds obtained by heuristic algorithms, reduction techniques and cutting planes to increase the efficiency of our models.

The method is applied to an underwater cylinder in crossflow at two subcrit ica l regimes (Re = 72 000 and 144 000). TSP maps are decomposed in a time-averaged, a phase-averaged, and a random component. The asymptotic form of the energy equation at the wall provides an Euler-Lagrange equation set that is solved numerically to gain the relative skin friction time- and phase-averaged fields from the TSP surface temperature maps. The comparison of the time averaged relative skin-friction profiles with the literature data shows an excellent agreement on the whole laminar boundary layer up to t he <b>laminar</b> <b>separation</b> line.

The specific influence of different forcing amplitudes and disturbance modes on {{the size and shape}} of the <b>laminar</b> <b>separation</b> bubble are illustrated.

It is shown that an appropriate selection of the forcing frequency together with a suitable location and length of the disturbance strip for exciting sinusoidal disturbance waves can be found with the help of linear stability theory.

40|$|In {{predicting}} the aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils operating at low Reynolds numbers, {{it is often}} important {{to account for the}} effects of <b>laminar</b> (transitional) <b>separation</b> bubbles. Previous approaches to the modelling of this viscous phenomenon range from fast but sometimes unreliable empirical correlations for the length of the bubble and the associated increase in momentum thickness, to more accurate but significantly slower displacement-thickness iteration methods employing inverse boundary-layer formulations in the separated regions. Since the penalty in computational time associated with the more general methods is unacceptable for airfoil design applications, use of an accurate yet computationally efficient model is highly desirable. To this end, a semi-empirical bubble model was developed and incorporated into the Eppler and Somers airfoil design and analysis program.

A NACA 0012 airfoil was sinusoidally pitched at quarter chord, and the oscillation amplitude was between ± 6 °. Surface-mounted probes and smoke-wire visualization were used for the examination of the boundary layers. The free-stream velocities were 1. 98, 2. 83, and 4. 03 m/s, and the corresponding chord Reynolds numbers were Rec= 2. 3 × 104, 3. 3 × 104, and 4. 8 × 104, respectively. In each case, the frequency of the airfoil oscillation was adjusted to fix the reduced frequency of 0. 1. It was observed in the presented low Reynolds number range that for a pitching airfoil, the separation bubble is formed within the stall angle as reattachment occurs. Also, unsteady <b>laminar</b> <b>separation</b> was observed at a saddle point, which is composed by the wall, external flow, and two vortices that is independent of reverse flow.
