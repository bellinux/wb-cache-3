40|$|Batteries used in Implantable cardiac pacemakers-present unique {{challenges}} to their developers and manufacturers {{in terms of}} high levels of safety and reliability. In addition, the batteries must have longevity to avoid frequent replacements. Technological advances in leads/electrodes have reduced energy requirements by two orders of magnitude. Microelectronics advances sharply reduce internal current drain concurrently decreasing size and increasing functionality, reliability, and longevity. It is reported that about 600, 000 pacemakers are implanted each year worldwide and {{the total number of}} people with various types of implanted pacemaker has already crossed 3 million. A cardiac pacemaker uses half of its battery power for cardiac stimulation and the other half for housekeeping tasks such as monitoring and data logging. The first implanted cardiac pacemaker used nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery, later on zinc-mercury battery was developed and used which lasted for over 2 years. <b>Lithium</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>battery</b> invented and used by Wilson Greatbatch and his team in 1972 made the real impact to implantable cardiac pacemakers. This battery lasts for about 10 years and even today is the power source for many manufacturers of cardiac pacemakers.

30|$|Drilling mud gas {{monitoring}} and sampling at IODP Site C 0002 {{at the southern}} rim of the Kumano forearc basin revealed the overall dominance of microbial methane to depths down to 1700  mbsf (Hammerschmidt et al. 2014) with increasing contribution of thermogenic gas at greater depth. Estimated formation temperatures at 1700  mbsf, based on long-term temperature monitoring at C 0002 (Sugihara et al. 2014), fall between 65 and 70  °C, depending on the assumed thermal conductivity. Although this temperature range marks also the beginning of thermogenic gas generation (Whiticar 1994), the low TOC content at depths below 1700  mbsf at Site C 0002 (Tobin et al., 2015) makes significant in situ generation of hydrocarbons by thermal degradation of organic matter little likely. Indeed, we favour migration of thermogenic gas from deeper sources and mixing with shallow bacterial hydrocarbon gas. Evidence for migration of deeper fluids in the Nankai Trough subduction zone is also provided by <b>lithium,</b> <b>iodine</b> and boron isotopes studies (Nishio et al. 2015, Tomaru and Fehn 2014, Hüpers et al. 2016). Unusual light 7 Li/ 6 Li ratios in fluids recovered from a Kumano mud volcano (Nishio et al. 2015) {{are in line with}} estimated temperatures of up to 310  °C, indicating a deep lithium-bearing fluid source. Iodine ages of pore water samples from C 0002 at depths as deep as 984  mbsf are significantly older than ages of the host sediments, iodine must thus have been transported from deeper formations older than 25  Ma (Tomaru and Fehn 2014). Boron concentration and isotope data from silt and sand layers (Hüpers et al. 2016) of the underthrust section of the downgoing plate at Nankai favour fluid flow in seaward direction from depths equivalent to the temperature range of 60  °C to 150  °C.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey {{recently}} updated a geochemical database {{consisting of}} data for approximately 160, 000 produced waters samples, primarily from petroleum and geothermal reservoirs. Using major and trace elements from conventional and unconventional well types from the database, this thesis provides a comprehensive, national evaluation for mineral commodity potential in produced waters. Produced waters contain virtually every naturally occurring element and can range in salinity to {{several times that}} of seawater. Despite the typical outlook to view produced waters as a waste, they have potential for natural resource development. ^ This thesis provides, for each mineral commodity found in the produced waters database, maps showing the distribution of concentration, economic values of mineral commodities, and statistical analysis, for the contiguous United States. The maps identify areas of interest for both resource potential and show the largest priority for future mineral exploration; {{as well as to}} identify data gaps and needs for future exploration. Identified constituents in concentrations at some locations exceed disposal costs and hold the greatest potential for profit: cesium, bromine, <b>lithium</b> carbonate, <b>iodine,</b> <b>lithium</b> chloride, magnesium, potash, soda ash, rubidium formate, and rubidium chloride. From these commodities, further data exploration would be required for rubidium formate, rubidium chloride and cesium. To maximize potential for development of produced waters is grouping minerals commodities to increase revenues. Either through selective or grouped removal for commodities, produced waters have potential for economic development. It may be possible to no longer consider produced waters as a waste product and a new viable resource. ...|$|R

The following effects were noted with lithium treatment: (a) thyroid weight increased concomitant with a slowing of thyroidal iodine release; (b) the ability to concentrate iodide was increased only after goiters were established; (c) on the LID, 131 I uptake was elevated throughout all phases of treatment, even when the release rate was normal; (d) iodine organification was unaffected but the proportion of 131 I present as iodothyronines was decreased; (e) the thyroidal 127 I content was increased; (f) despite these changes, the serum PBI remained normal as did the thyroxine turnover rate; and (g) thyrotropin (TSH) levels in serum were the same as controls except for a slight elevation early in the course of treatment; TSH levels did not correlate with goitrogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of hyperthyroidism is targeted at reducing {{the production of}} thyroid hormones by inhibiting their synthesis or suppressing their release, {{as well as by}} controlling their influence on peripheral tissue (conservative therapy, medical treatment).

50|$|In {{the cell}} as {{developed}} for cardiac pacemaker application, the anode is lithium and the cathode a proprietary composition of iodine and poly-2-vinyl pyridine, {{neither of which}} is electrically conductive. However, after processing by mixing and heating to ~ 150 °C for 72 hours the components react {{with each other to}} form an electrically conductive viscous liquid which, while still molten, is poured into the cell where it cools to form a solid. When the liquid contacts the lithium anode it creates a monomolecular layer of semiconducting crystalline lithium iodide. As the cell is discharged by the current load of the pacemaker, the reaction between the <b>lithium</b> anode and <b>iodine</b> cathode forms a growing barrier of lithium iodide, which being resistive causes the terminal voltage of the cell to decrease approximately as an inverse function of the volume of the barrier. Pacemaker designers use this characteristic to permit detection of incipient 'end of life' of the pacemaker's lithium cell.|$|R

DSSCs based on biopolymer gel electrolyte systems offer the perspective of competitive conversion efficiencies with a very low-cost fabrication. In this paper, a new starch-based biopolymer gel electrolyte system is prepared by mixing <b>lithium</b> iodide and <b>iodine</b> with bare and citric acid cross-linked potato starches with glycerol as the plasticizing agent. The effect of the preparation methods on the starch cross-linking degree {{as well as the}} photoconversion efficiency of the resulting DSSC cells is carefully analyzed. Fourier transform spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the morphology and conformational changes of starch in the electrolytes. The conductivity of the biopolymer electrolytes was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. DSSC based on the starch-gel polymer electrolytes were characterized by photovoltaic measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results clearly show that the cross-linking increases the recombination resistance and open circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC, and thereby the photoconversion efficiency of the cell. In particular, electrolytes containing 1. 4 g bare and cross-linked starches showed ionic conductivities of σ = 1. 61, 0. 59, 0. 38, and 0. 35 S cm− 1, and the corresponding DSSCs showed efficiencies of 1. 2, 1. 4, 0. 93, and 1. 11 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the levels of 39 toxic metals and essential minerals in hair samples of children with autism spectrum disorders and their mothers compared to controls. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry was used to analyze the elemental content of the hair of children with autism spectrum disorders (n= 51), a subset of their mothers (n= 29), neurotypical children (n= 40), and a subset of their mothers (n= 25). All participants were recruited from Arizona. Iodine levels were 45 % lower in the children with autism (p= 0. 005). Autistic children with pica had a 38 % lower level of chromium (p= 0. 002). Autistic children with low muscle tone had very low levels of potassium (– 66 %, p= 0. 01) and high zinc (31 %, p= 0. 01). The mothers of young children with autism had especially low levels of lithium (56 % lower, p= 0. 005), and the young chil-dren (ages 3 – 6 yr) with autism also had low lithium (– 30 %, p= 0. 04). Low iodine levels are consistent with previous reports of abnormal thyroid function, which likely affected development of speech and cognitive skills. Low lithium in the mothers likely caused low levels of lithium in the young children, which could have affected their neurological and immunological development.

30|$|Crystallinity and phase {{analysis}} of the films were carried out using X-ray diffraction method (Rigaku Rint 2000 series). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and structural studies {{have been carried out}} using transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM- 2100). Transmission spectra have been recorded using UV–VIS–NIR spectrophotometer (Jasco V- 570). <b>Lithium</b> iodide, <b>iodine</b> and acetonitrile purchased from Sigma-Aldrich have been used as received for the preparation of electrolyte. The redox electrolyte with [I_ 3 ^ -]/[I−] 1 : 9 was prepared by dissolving 0.5  M LiI and 0.05  M I 2 in acetonitrile solvent. Since LiI is extremely hygroscopic, electrolytes were prepared in a dry room maintained at dew point of 60  °C. The counter electrode was prepared by using platinum chloride as follows: the H 2 PtCl 6 solution in isopropanol (2  mg/ml) was deposited onto the ITO glass by spin coating method. TiO 2 electrode annealed at 500  °C was immersed in the extracted dye solution at room temperature for 24  h in the dark, since the grape dye extract is not stable under prolonged illumination of light. The electrode was then rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess dye present in the electrode and then the electrode was dried. The counter electrode was placed {{on the top of the}} TiO 2 electrode, such that the conductive side of the counter electrode facing the TiO 2 film with a spacer separating the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clamped firmly together using a binder clip. Now the prepared liquid electrolyte solution was injected into the space between the clamped electrodes. The electrolyte enters into the cell by capillary action. This resulted in the formation of sandwich type cell. Natural dye-sensitized TiO 2 -based solar cells have been fabricated with area of 0.25  cm 2, and it was found that the cell efficiency was independent of cell area in this range as reported by Yamazaki et al. [17]. The J–V characteristics of the cell were recorded using a Keithley 4200 -SCS meter.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{incorporation}} of aluminum nitride (AlN) in the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) of a quasi-solid-state {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC) were studied in terms of performance of the cell. The electrolyte, consisting of <b>lithium</b> iodide (LiI), <b>iodine</b> (I 2), and 4 -tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3 -methoxypropionitrile (MPN), was solidified with poly(vinyidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP). The 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 5 wt% of AlN {{were added to the}} electrolyte for this study. XRD analysis showed a reduction of crystallinity in the polymer PVDF-HFP for all the additions of AlN. The DSSC fabricated with a GPE containing 0. 1 wt% AlN showed a short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of 12. 92 ± 0. 54 mA/cm 2 and 5. 27 ± 0. 23 %, respectively, at 100 mW/cm 2 illumination, in contrast to the corresponding values of 11. 52 ± 0. 21 mA/cm 2 and 4. 75 ± 0. 08 % for a cell without AlN. The increases both in JSC and in η of the promoted DSSC are attributed to the higher apparent diffusion coefficient of I- in its electrolyte (3. 52 × 10 - 6 cm 2 /s), compared to that in the electrolyte without AlN of a DSSC (2. 97 × 10 - 6 cm 2 /s). At-rest stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSC with 0. 1 wt% of AlN was found to decrease hardly by 5 % and 7 % at room temperature and at 40 °C, respectively, after 1000 h duration. The DSSC with a liquid electrolyte showed a decrease of about 40 % at room temperature, while it virtually lost its performance in about 150 h at 40 °C. Explanations are further substantiated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and by porosity measurements. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
