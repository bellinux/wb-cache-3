The chair comprises a collapsible structure having a seat, a back rest, a pair of armrests {{and a pair of}} substantially planar <b>leg</b> <b>rests.</b> The <b>leg</b> <b>rests</b> are spaced apart from each other to enable a patient 2 ̆ 7 s legs to be supported thereon in an abducted position suitable for an OB/GYN examination, and define therebetween an examination/demonstration space in which an OB/GYN caregiver can conduct an OB/GYN examination or procedure. Additionally, the seat has support structure which enables a slidable basin to be integrally connected with the seat. The chair has a seat which is relatively short in comparison to typical chairs designed as furniture pieces. Thus, the patient 2 ̆ 7 s perineum would be disposed substantially above {{the front end of the}} chair, and the back rest would provide the patient with lumbar and upper torso support. This feature, coupled with the spaced apart <b>leg</b> <b>rests</b> upon which the patient 2 ̆ 7 s feet and/or <b>legs</b> <b>rest,</b> with the patient 2 ̆ 7 s legs in an abducted position, provides convenient, comfortable and substantially unobstructed access by an OB/GYN caregiver to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s perineum, for conducting an examination or procedure (e. g. a vaginal ultrasound) ...|$|R

It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the middle seat for 25% more each, can use it as a flat sleeping surface. Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same basic facilities as a standard Pacific Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the <b>leg</b> <b>rests</b> are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.|$|R

50|$|Reclining or tilt-in-space wheelchairs have seating {{surfaces}} {{which can}} be tilted to various angles. The original concept was developed by an orthotist, Hugh Barclay, who worked with disabled children and observed that postural deformities such as scoliosis could be supported or partially corrected by allowing the wheelchair user to relax in a tilted position. The feature is also of value to users {{who are unable to}} sit upright for extended periods for pain or other reasons. Various designs are now available and wheelchairs with the feature may either tilt the seat-back and legrests in relation to the seat, or may tilt the entire back, seat and <b>leg</b> <b>rest</b> as one, depending on the need of the user.|$|E

In Chola sculptures as in the Valuvur and Darasuram images, the right <b>leg</b> often <b>rests</b> on the elephant's head and left leg is bent and raised above the right thigh (utkutikasana posture). In both configurations, the description in iconographical treatises where the left <b>leg</b> <b>rests</b> on the elephant's head is ignored.|$|R

50|$|During 1926-29 {{and after}} 1948 the Golden State was an extra-fare train, {{supposedly}} {{to account for}} the costs of the luxury service and the reservation system for chair car seating. In later years the extra fare became something of a joke as service deteriorated badly. Extra fare for Pullman accommodation Los Angeles to Chicago was $10 in 1948, adding perhaps 10% to the total fare. The $3.50 extra fare for chair car passengers had the advantage of individual reserved seats and modern, <b>leg</b> <b>rest,</b> air-conditioned coaches. If you did not want to pay the extra fare, the slower secondary trains (see below) were available. The additional costs in a non-computer era for coach seat reservations were substantial; however, a nationwide reservation system for Pullman (sleeping car) passengers had existed for many decades.|$|E

The public opening took place at noon on 28 June 2012. TfL {{reported}} that the total cost of the project was about £60 million, of which £45 million went towards construction. It estimates that the service can carry 2,500 people per hour.There are 36 passenger gondolas, of which 34 are in use at any one time, with a maximum capacity of 10 passengers each.

5000|$|One {{example of}} a {{computer}} system {{that can be used}} as a computer-aided ergonomics system is [...] that consider the human body as a dynamic multi-rigid-body system. The human model is a public domain model contains most of the bones, muscles and joints that are present in the human body. The model in total have more than 1000 muscle elements, and many muscle elements have been modeled with the most detailed muscle model theory described by Hill, A.V. in 1938. The muscle model contains information as physiological cross-sectional area, length, penation angle, ratio of red and white fibers and so on. The AnyBody modeling system is capable of modeling almost any human voluntary movement or static situation. One {{example of a}} model, could be a seated model, where the human body is placed in a chair, that have a seat, backrest, headrest, <b>leg</b> <b>rest,</b> footrest, and armrest. The model can then calculate the forces acting between the human body and the chair, as well as for example the forces between any given spinal vertebra. This could be used for finding the optimal seated posture for a person, who suffers from lower back pain, assuming that greater load on a vertebra result in greater pain.|$|E
