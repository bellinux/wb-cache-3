In this approach, three different scales are defined: the microscopic, at single crystal (single lamella) scale; the mesoscopic, at {{the scale of}} a single lamellar colony and the macroscopic, at the <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregate</b> level. This formulation is compared with the two-site VPSC model and both are applied {{to the prediction of}} the plastic anisotropy of an as-cast sample of a lamellar γ-TiAl based alloy (Ti– 48 at%Al– 2 at%Cr) tested under compression. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{eutectoid}} transformation {{may be defined}} as a solid-state diffusion-controlled decomposition process of a high-temperature phase into a two-phase <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregate</b> behind a migrating boundary on cooling below the eutectoid temperature. in substitutional solid solutions, the eutectoid reaction involves diffusion of the solute atoms either through the matrix or along the boundaries or ledges. the effect of Ag on the non-isothermal kinetics of the reverse eutectoid reaction in the Cu- 9 mass%Al, Cu- 10 mass%Al, and Cu- 11 mass%Al alloys were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). the activation energy for this reaction was obtained using the Kissinger and Ozawa methods. the results indicated that Ag additions to Cu-Al alloys interfere on the reverse eutectoid reaction, increasing the activation energy values for the Cu- 9 mass%Al and Cu- 10 mass%Al alloys and decreasing these values for the Cu- 11 mass%Al alloy for additions up to 6 mass%Ag. the changes in the activation energy were attributed to changes in the reaction solute and in Ag solubility due to the increase in Al content.

40|$|Synthetic rhamnolipids, {{derived from}} a natural diacylated glycolipid, RL- 2, 2 (14), {{produced}} by Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) plantarii, were analyzed biophysically. Changes in the chemical structures comprised variations in the length, the stereochemistry and numbers of the lipid chains, numbers of rhamnoses, and the occurrence of charged or neutral groups. As relevant biophysical parameters, the gel (beta) to liquid crystalline (alpha) phase behavior of the acyl chains of the rhamnoses, their three-dimensional supramolecular aggregate structure, {{and the ability of}} the compounds to intercalate into phospholipid liposomes in the absence and presence of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were monitored. Their biological activities were examined as the ability to induce cytokines in human mononuclear cells and to induce chemiluminescence in monocytes. Depending on the particular chemical structures, the physicochemical parameters as well as the biological test systems show large variations. This relates to the acyl chain fluidity, aggregate structure, and intercalation ability, as well as the bioactivity. Most importantly, the data extend our conformational concept of endotoxicity, based on the intercalation of naturally originating amphiphilic virulence factors into membranes from immune cells. This 'endotoxin conformation', produced by amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophilic charged backbone and apolar hydrophobic moiety, and adopting inverted cubic aggregate structures, causes high mechanical stress in target immune cells on integral proteins, eventually leading to cell activation. Furthermore, biologically inactive rhamnolipids with <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregate</b> structures antagonize the endotoxin-induced activity in a way similar to lipid A-derived antagonists...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAggregates and solubilized trimers of LHCII were {{characterized}} by circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and compared with thylakoid membranes in order to evaluate the native state of LHCII in vivo.

Thylakoid membranes or LHCII aggregates solubilized with detergent exhibited CD spectra similar to the isolated trimers. Solubilization of LHCII was accompanied by profound changes in the linear dichroism and increase in fluorescence lifetime. These data support the notion that <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> of LHCII retain the native organization of LHCII in the thylakoid membranes.

40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} alloys {{based on}} the phase gamma-TiAl are a promising class of materials for high temperature structural applications. In this thesis, their micromechanical behavior was investigated through the combination of experimental and computational techniques. First, an advanced characterization technique for gamma-TiAl based microstructures is presented. Through the use of high accuracy measurement parameters and an enhanced indexing algorithm, the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method was improved to reliably resolve the gamma-TiAl order domains. This makes available {{for the first time}} the automatic acquisition of large and detailed microstructural maps of the domain-resolved crystal orientation and phase distribution in this material. The improved orientation mapping technique was used to study the orientation dependent nanoindentation of the gamma-TiAl phase. Single crystals of gamma-TiAl cannot be grown in the near-stoichiometric compositions that are present inside two-phase gamma/alpha 2 -microstructures with attractive mechanical properties. Because of this limitation, an approach was developed to study the single crystal constitutive behavior of gamma-TiAl by nanoindentation experiments in single phase regions of these gamma/alpha 2 -microstructures. The indented crystallographic orientations were characterized by the order domain resolved orientation mapping technique. Atomic force microscopy was employed to measure the evolving material pile-up around the impressions. A 3 D elasto-viscoplastic crystal plasticity formulation was extended to incorporate the deformation behavior of gamma-TiAl. Deformation systems were implemented for dislocation glide on four ordinary dislocation systems and eight superdislocation systems. Additionally, four true twinning systems were implemented as uni-directional deformation systems. The crystal plasticity model is coupled with the finite element method. Thereby, it was possible to perform simulations of single crystal indentation. Experiments and simulations were combined to study the orientation dependent indentation pile-up. A convention was defined to unambiguously relate any indentation axis to a crystallographic orientation. The characteristic pile-up topographies around indents were simulated throughout the unit triangle of gamma-TiAl and represented graphically in the newly introduced inverse pole figure of pile-up patterns. The spatially resolved simulation of the activation of competing deformation mechanisms during indentation, enabled an assessment of their relative strengths. Through this approach, easy activation of ordinary dislocation glide in stoichiometric gamma-TiAl was confirmed independently from dislocation observation by transmission electron microscopy. On the length-scale of multi-grain aggregates, two kinds of microstructures were investigated. The lamellar microstructure was analyzed in terms of kinematic constraints perpendicular to densely spaced lamellar boundaries which lead to pronounced plastic anisotropy. A homogenized crystal plasticity model is presented that quantitatively captures the micromechanics of the lamellar two-phase microstructure. Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of refined microstructures was modeled. The assumption of a lower degree of kinematic constraints for these microstructures resulted in less plastic anisotropy on the single grain scale. Also lower compatibility stresses evolved during the simulated deformation of a 64 -grain aggregate with refined microstructure in comparison to a fully <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregate.</b> On the macroscopic length scale, the simulations could explain the pre-yielding of lamellar microstructures...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} has been to explore the native monorhamnolipid (mRL) mixture produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, as well as newly- synthesized monorhamnolipid diastereomers (R,R) -Rha-C 10 -C 10, (R,S) -Rha-C 10 -C 10, (S,S) -Rha-C 10 -C 10 and (S,R) -Rha-C 10 -C 10, to understand their aggregation and phase behavior in aqueous solution. This work {{is in response to}} the consideration that biosurfactants offer a "greener" alternative to conventional surfactants. Relationships between chemical structure of the diastereomers and surface activity were studied using surface tension measurements. It was found that the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) values are lower for deprotonated (R,S) -Rha-C 10 -C 10 and higher for protonated (R,S) -Rha-C 10 -C 10 compared to the other diastereomers or the native mRL mixture. Furthermore, the 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 diastereomeric mixture has the overall lowest cross-sectional area for deprotonated rhamnolipids. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to study the hydrodynamic radii (Rh) of the mRL aggregates and the four diastereomers in aqueous solution. In all five surfactants studied, each observed at pH 8. 0 and 4. 0, three aggregate populations were observed. For all deprotonated rhamnolipids the micelle, at a hydrodynamic radius of ~ 2 nm, was found to be in the highest abundance where the two lower abundant other population take on a <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregate</b> structure. Data to support this were collected using fluorescence probing techniques. For the surfactants in the protonated state, pH 4. 0, it was found that all form primarily lamellar structures, also confirmed using fluorescence probing. The average aggregation numbers (Nagg) of the micelles for the deprotonated native mRL mixture and the four diastereomers were studied using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements. Somewhat unexpectedly, the Nagg values were observed to be a strong function of the rhamnolipid concentration for all systems. At low concentrations, pre-micellar aggregates with aggregation numbers too small for micelles were observed. A critical concentration is identified at which a critical aggregation number is defined; this is proposed to be the smallest fully-formed micelle in solution with values of ~ 25 - 30 molecules/micelle for the native mRL mixture and all four diastereomers. Thus, the aggregation properties of the native mRL mixture and the four diastereomers are generally similar at this critical concentration. However, the increase in aggregation number above this critical point varies for all the surfactants, where the (R,R) -Rha-C 10 -C 10 diastereomer has the greatest increase in monomers with concentration and the (S,S) and (R,S) diastereomers have the lowest. The increased observed aggregation number is consistent with the computational work showing increased growth with concentration for the deprotonated rhamnolipid micelles. Furthermore, these computations have confirmed the ability of protonated rhamnolipids to form lamellar structures in solution. Fluorescence probing work was also used to study rhamnolipid phase behavior as a function of varying solution conditions, such as ionic strength, solution pH, surfactant concentration, and temperature. Steady-state fluorescence methods are utilized to probe the surfactant microenvironment using the polarity-sensitive dyes prodan and laurdan. By dissolving the dye within the rhamnolipid aggregates and observing their solvatochromic behavior, all surfactants studied are known to form more micellar aggregates at high pH and low surfactant concentration, whereas elongation of the micelle is observed at low pH and moderate to high surfactant concentration...|$|E

These tails are poorly miscible and likely to micro-segregate if the surfactant molecules assemble. <b>Lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> appear at CB-B 2 ES concentrations higher than 5 wt% and were found to undergo repeat formation/breakdown periodically at 30 ˚C, with an average domain lifetime of ~ 10 seconds. To investigate effects of the temperature-sensitive oxyethylene units on the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) of the CB-B 2 ES bilayers, a fluorescence probe 1 -pyrene-carboxaldehide was solubilized in the mixtures to sense the micro-environmental polarities. Fluorimetric measurements suggested that the polarity of CB-B 2 ES bilayers is very similar as for the non-ethoxylated CB-B 2 ES analogue at high temperatures (≥ 65 ºC). However, for CB-B 2 ES polarity increased with decreasing temperature, in contrast to the small decrease in polarity observed for analogous non-ethoxylated bilayers. This is consistent with increased hydration of the oxyethylene units in CB-B 2 ES bilayers at low temperatures. The periodic formation/breakdown and the cooling-induced hydrophilicity of the CB-B 2 ES <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> did not appear in the non-hybrid and/or non-ethoxylated surfactant systems.

Depending on the type of cation, concentration of salt, and isomeric purity of the alkyl chain of the surfactant, different types of phases are observed: large unilamellar vesicles, multivesicular vesicles, and flocculated multilamellar vesicles (lamellar droplets). Over limited concentration ranges, some salts induce phase separation in a surfactant-rich and a surfactant-lean phase. The formation of the different phases was monitored by turbidity and fluorescence depolarization measurements, whereas the phases were characterized by light microscopy, freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Thermodynamic aspects of aggregation, in particular the counterion binding characteristics, were studied by microcalorimetry and conductivity. On a molecular level, the packing in a lamellar array can be explained largely in terms of a change in counterion binding and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease of the hydration of the headgroup and the. counterion. A better counterion binding is facilitated by a less hydrated cation or by an increase of the electrolyte concentration.

These methods do not permit to detect nanophases in host-crystals and lead to erroneous interpretation of analytical results, considering the elements of nanophases as belonging to the crystal structure of the main phase. More detailed analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on foils prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) can be used to solve this analytical problem. In this study, <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> of potassium-rich clinopyroxenes were detected in copper smelting slags by a combination of SEM and EPMA. However, FIB-TEM indicated the presence of leucite inclusions (tens to hundreds nm in size) within the clinopyroxene lamellae. Based on examples from smelting slags and other solid waste materials, recommendations for standard SEM and EPMA applications and the need for methods with higher resolution for mineralogical {{investigation of}} waste materials are discussed...|$|R

Recently, a lamellar model was proposed for the arrangement of pigment aggregates in Chlorobium tepidum chlorosomes, which contain bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c as the main pigment. Here we demonstrate that the lamellar organization {{is also found in}} chlorosomes from two brown-colored species (Chl. phaeovibrioides and Chl. phaeobacteroides) containing BChl e as the main pigment. This suggests that the lamellar model is universal among green sulfur bacteria. In contrast to green-colored Chl. tepidum, chlorosomes from the brown-colored species often contain domains of <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> that may help them to survive in extremely low light conditions. We suggest that carotenoids are localized between the lamellar planes and drive lamellar assembly by augmenting hydrophobic interactions. A model for chlorosome assembly, which accounts for the role of carotenoids and secondary BChl homologs, is presented. This study was supported by Academy of Finland grants (206926 and 211986 to R.

40|$|Graftonite- beusite is {{relatively}} {{widespread in the}} LCT family of granitic pegmatites of the Bothnian basin and of the Utii- Mysingen field in Sweden. It commonly constitutes the matrix containing either coarse lamellae of sarcopside, which in turn hosts fine lamellae of triphylite, or abundant lamellae of triphylite with bimodal size-distribution. Deformed and recrystallized granular aggregates of graftonite with triphylite, wolfeite and sarcopside are rare. Graftonite- beusite is systematically Ca,Mn-rich and Mg-poor relative to sarcopside, {{which in turn is}} slightly Mn-rich and distinctly Mg-poor relative to the Li-concentrating triphylite. Bulk compositions of the <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> crystal-chemical and textural relationships among the individual phosphates, and cation distribution-coefficients indicate two patterns ofexsolution that generated the lamellar intergro*ths from disordered homogeneous precursors: C 4 li-poor graftonite exsolved lithian sarcopside, which in turn broke down to sarcopside with triphylite lamellae, and Ca,Li(Mn) -rich graftonite- beusite exsolved triphylite directly. ln regional 2 oning of pegmatite groups, Ca-bearing graftonite- beusite is either the first Fe,lVn(Li) -phosphate encountered in the beryl- columbite pegmatites, or it is found within the zone of beryl- columbite- triphylite pegmatites. Appreciable concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn (and in part Mg), but low levels of F and N 4 are required to stabilize graftonite- beusite. Good correlation of the Mn/(Mn + Fe) values of the phosphates with those of garnet suggests that the homogeneous graftonite...|$|R
40|$|Morphology, {{dielectric}} breakdown and mechanical properties {{have been studied}} {{in a number of}} model polyolefin systems. The TEM investigation of the morphology of a propylenelethylene copolymer containing a clarifying additive showed that the addition of the clarifier generally results in enhanced nucleation and the consequent formation of a more uniform structure. However, the morphology of the copolymer is shown to change abruptly from a fine to a coarse structure when the crystallisation temperature exceeds 128 deg. C. This is associated with a marked reduction in nucleation efficiency of the additive, which permits the growth of distinct spatially separated morphological features. These morphological features have further been clarified by investigation of the morphology of the pure copolymer, which was nucleated using self-seeding technique. A number of characteristic forms of <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> present either in the clarified or pure copolymer are evidenced as a result of different directions in which they are viewed. Two distinct types of lamellae are found: lath-like crystals and cross-hatching lamellae. The former results from primary crystallisation, whereas the later is associated with secondary crystallisation. The different populations of lamellae correspond to multiple melting peaks observed in DSC traces. The electric strength of the clarified propylenelethylene copolymer exhibits a clear dependence on sample morphology. The parallel trend is also found in the mechanical ultimate failure stress and strain of the material, as recorded at the relatively high strain rate of 100 mm/min. The electrical tree growth in this material is significantly dependent on morphology. At the same electrical treeing condition, a branch-type tree forms in the quenched sample with a uniform structure, whereas a bush-type tree develops in the 134 deg. C crystallised sample with a coarse morphology. A CCD camera shows that the branch-type tree is electrically conducting, whereas the bush-type tree is non-conducting. The tree growth rate as a function of applied voltage in the two samples also exhibits different forms. The morphology of a linear/branched polyethylene blend has been investigated by SEM. The morphology of this system can be controlled appropriately by varying the thermal history. Open banded spherulites are formed at lower crystallisation temperatures, which impinge upon one another, whereas higher temperature crystallisation results in sheaf-like <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> which are distinct and separated by a low crystallinity matrix. The mechanical properties of this system are also examined, and are found to vary with the morphology of the material. Tree channels in the polyethylene blend are very clearly revealed. The location of the channels is significantly dependent on the microstructure of the material. Most of channels are distributed in low crystallinity regions, particularly, at the boundaries of spherulites. The structure of channels themselves is also revealed. Two types of channel are found; one, with a shell, appears electrically conducting, whereas, the other, with no shell, appears non-conducting. The formation of the different types of channel depends on both the treeing conditions and the morphology of the material.

40|$|Mixtures of micelle-forming and lamella-forming amphiphiles in {{solution}} {{can form}} disk-shaped bilayers, {{sometimes referred to}} as bicelles. Using self-consistent field theory (SCFT), we investigate the structure and stability of these aggregates in a blend of two species of PS-PDMS diblock with PDMS homopolymer at 225 C. We find that the center of each disk is mainly composed of lamella-forming diblocks, while its thicker rim is mostly formed of micelle-forming diblocks. However, this segregation is not perfect, and the concentration of micelle formers is of the order of 10 % on the flat central surface of the bicelle. We also find that the addition of micelle former to the mixture of lamella former and homopolymer is necessary for disk-like bicelles to be stable. Specifically, the free energy density of the disk has a minimum {{as a function of the}} disk radius when both micelle- and lamella-forming diblocks are present, indicating that the bicelles have a preferred, finite radius. However, it decays monotonically when only lamella former is present, indicating that the bicelle structure is always unstable with respect to further aggregation in these systems. Finally, we identify a concentration range where the bicelle is predicted to have a lower free energy density than the simple cylindrical and <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> and so might be thermodynamically stable.

40|$|Investigations {{regarding}} the self-assembly of (bola) phospholipids in aqueous media {{are crucial to}} understand the complex relationship between chemical structure of lipids and the shape and size of their aggregates in water. Here, we introduce a new asymmetrical glycerol diether bolaphospholipid, the compound Me 2 PE-Gly(2 C 16) C 32 -OH. This bolalipid contains a long (C 32) ω-hydroxy alkyl chain bond to glycerol in the sn- 3 position, a C 16 alkyl chain at the sn- 2 position, and a protonable phosphodimethylethanolamine (Me 2 PE) headgroup at the sn- 1 position of the glycerol. The aggregation behavior of this bolalipid was studied {{as a function of}} temperature and pH using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We show that this bolalipid <b>aggregates</b> into condensed <b>lamellar</b> sheets in acidic milieu and in large sheet-like aggregates at neutral pH-value. By contrast, at a pH-value of 10, where the Me 2 PE headgroup is only partially protonated, small lipid disks with diameter 50 – 100 nm were additionally found. Moreover, the miscibility of this asymmetrical bolalipid with the bilayer-forming phosphatidylcholine DPPC was investigated by means of DSC and TEM. The incorporation of bolalipids into phospholipid membranes could result in stabilized liposomes applicable for drug delivery purposes. We show that mixtures of DPPC and Me 2 PE-Gly(2 C 16) C 32 -OH form large <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> at pH of 5, 7, and 10.

40|$|Stearic acid or {{eicosanoic acid}} mixed with di- or {{oligomeric}} amines in specific molar ratios form stable gels in water. The formation of such hydrogels {{depends on the}} hydro-phobicity of the fatty acid, and also {{on the type of}} amine used. The gelation properties of these two-component systems were investigated using electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, $^ 1 H$ NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and both single-crystal and cast-film X-ray diffraction. Results of FTIR spectral analysis suggest salt formation during gelation. $^ 1 H$ NMR analysis of the gels indicates that the fatty acid chains are immobilized in the get state and when the gel melts, these chains regain their mobility. Analysis of DSC data indicates that increase in the spacer length in the di-/oligomeric amine lowers the gel-melting temperature. Two of these gelator salts developed into crystals and structural details of such systems could be secured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structural information of the salts thus obtained was compared with the XRD data of the self-supporting films of those gels. Such analyses provided pertinent structural insight into the supramolecular interactions that prevail within these gelator assemblies. Analysis of the crystal structure confirmed that multilayered <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> exist in the gel and it also showed that the three-dimensional ordering observed in the crystalline phase is retained in only one direction in the gel state. Finally, the hydrogel was used as a medium for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

40|$|Novel reduced sugar gemini amphiphiles linked {{through their}} {{tertiary}} amino head groups via alkyl spacers of 4 or 6 carbons, and with varying (unsaturated) alkyl tail lengths of 12 - 18, have been synthesized and tested for transfection in vitro in an adherent Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K 1). Transfection efficiencies peaked at 2. 7 {{times that of}} the commercial standard Lipofectamine Plus/ 2000 for pure solutions of the compound bearing unsaturated (oleyl) alkyl tails. For those compounds bearing saturated alkyl tails, transfection efficiency peaked at a tail length of 16, at a level similar to Lipofectamine Plus/ 2000. All of the amphiphiles formed bilayer vesicles at physiological pH. Some of the amino groups at the surface were protonated, and vesicles therefore bore a positive charge. Increased protonation with reduced pH resulted in greatly increased monomer solubility and a morphology change from vesicle to micelle at characteristic pH values, dependent on the tail length. For the compounds promoting high transfection efficiency, this characteristic pH was within the range found in the endosomal compartment (7. 4 - 4. 0). Formation of mixed micelles between gemini surfactant and membrane phospholipids at reduced pH may therefore provide a method of endosome rupture and subsequent escape of entrapped DNA, thus discarding the need for extra fusogenic or endosomolytic agents. The positive charge on the vesicles at physiological pH drives the colloidal association with DNA. Small angle X-ray scattering measurements indicate that <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> are formed, which have a d spacing of 48 - 54 Å. Preliminary differential scanning calorimetric measurements suggest that reduction of pH causes a disordering of the hydrocarbon region of the DNA-surfactant complex. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLinear optical {{spectra of}} solubilized trimers and small <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{of the major}} light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) of higher plants are {{simulated}} employing excitonic couplings and site energies of chlorophylls (Chls) computed {{on the basis of}} the two crystal structures by a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach. A good agreement between simulation and experiment is achieved (except for the circular dichroism in the Chl b region), if vibronic transitions of Chls are taken into account. Site energies are further optimized by refinement fits of optical spectra. The differences between refined and directly calculated values are not significant enough to decide, whether the crystal structures are closer to trimers or aggregates. Changes in the linear dichroism spectrum upon aggregation are related to site energy shifts of Chls b 601, b 607, a 603, a 610, and a 613, and are interpreted in terms of conformational changes of violaxanthin and the two luteins involving their ionone rings. Chl a 610 is the energy sink at 77 K in both conformations. An analysis of absorption spectra of trimers perpendicular and parallel to the C 3 -axis (van Amerongen et al. Biophys. J. 67 (1994) 837 – 847) shows that only Chl a 604 close to neoxanthin is significantly reoriented in trimers compared to the crystal structures. Whether this pigment is orientated in aggregates as in the crystal structures, can presently not be determined faithfully. To finally decide about pigment reorientations that could be of relevance for non-photochemical quenching, further polarized absorption and fluorescence measurements of aggregates or detergent-depleted LHCII would be helpful.

40|$|Toxic" {{neutrophils}} from humans {{with severe}} bacterial infections, {{identified by the}} presence of Döhle bodies, "toxic" granules, and vacuoles were shown to differ from normal neutrophils both in ultrastructure and in lysosome activity. Döhle bodies were identified as <b>lamellar</b> <b>aggregates</b> of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Toxic granules corresponded to the azurophilic granules usually identified by Romanowsky stains only in neutrophil precursors. By electron microscopy such granules were large, electron-dense, and peroxidase positive; they could usually be distinguished from the smaller, less dense, "specific" granules also present in control neutrophils, but in the latter they became visible by light microscopy only after prolonged staining or following fixation with glutaraldehyde. These observations suggest that toxic granules represent an abnormal staining reaction of the large dense granules in the toxic cells, and not phagocytized material, newly formed abnormal granules or autophagic bodies. Alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly greater in toxic neutrophils than in normal ones; 80 % of the activity of both was located in the lysosome fraction. Beta glucuronidase was normal. Total acid phosphatase was normal, but the percentage located in the nonlysosome fraction of toxic neutrophils was increased, suggesting that lysosomes were "labilized. " Formation of neutral red vacuoles in supravitally stained preparations, an index of lysosome activity, occurred more rapidly in toxic neutrophils. This reaction paralleled degranulation and the formation of clear vacuoles in unstained wet mounts and could be blocked by colchicine, a lysosome stabilizer, or enhanced by procedures which activate lysosomes. "Autophagic" vacuoles were observed by electron microscopy in some toxic neutrophils. These observations are discussed in relation to the concept that the "toxic" neutrophils in severe bacterial infection reflect cellular immaturity and/or stimulation or degeneration...|$|R
