40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{meta-analysis}} of the effects of sanitizing treatments of fresh produce on Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, and Listeria monocytogenes. From 55 primary studies found to report on such effects, 40 were selected based on specific criteria, leading to more than 1, 000 data on mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> of these three bacterial pathogens impairing the safety of fresh produce. Data were partitioned to build three meta-analytical models that could allow the assessment of differences in mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> among pathogens, fresh produce, and sanitizers. Moderating variables assessed in the meta-analytical models included type of fresh produce, type of sanitizer, concentration, and treatment time and temperature. Further, a proposal was done to classify the sanitizers according to bactericidal efficacy by means of a meta-analytical dendrogram. The results indicated that both time and temperature significantly affected the mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> of the sanitizing treatment (P < 0. 0001). In general, sanitizer treatments led to lower mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> when applied to leafy greens (for example, 0. 68 <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> [0. 00 to 1. 37] achieved in lettuce) compared to other, nonleafy vegetables (for example, 3. 04 mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> [2. 32 to 3. 76] obtained for carrots). Among the pathogens, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was more resistant to ozone (1. 6 mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions),</b> while L. monocytogenes and Salmonella presented high resistance to organic acids, such as citric acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid (∼ 3. 0 mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions).</b> With regard to the sanitizers, it has been found that slightly acidic electrolyzed water, acidified sodium chlorite, and the gaseous chlorine dioxide clustered together, indicating that they possessed the strongest bactericidal effect.

Oriented for application in food industry disinfection, the effectiveness of both medium molecular weight (MMW) chitosan and its enzymatically hydrolyzed product was tested against mature biofilms of four pathogenic strains, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica, and a food spoilage species, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Unexpectedly, <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> were in some cases higher for biofilm than for planktonic cells.

40|$|Pima County, Ariz., is {{currently}} investigating {{the potential benefits}} of land application of sewage sludge. To assess risks associated with the presence of pathogenic enteric viruses present in the sludge, laboratory studies were conducted to measure the inactivation rate (k = <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day) of poliovirus type 1 and bacteriophages MS 2 and PRD- 1 in two sludge-amended desert agricultural soils (Brazito Sandy Loam and Pima Clay Loam). Under constant moisture (approximately - 0. 05 × 105 Pa for both soils) and temperatures of 15, 27, and 40 °C, the main factors controlling the inactivation of these viruses were soil temperature and texture. As the temperature increased from 15 to 40 °C, the inactivation rate increased significantly for poliovirus and MS 2, whereas, for PRD- 1, {{a significant increase in the}} inactivation rate was observed only at 40 °C. Clay loam soils afforded more protection to all three viruses than sandy soils. At 15 °C, the inactivation rate for MS 2 ranged from 0. 366 to 0. 394 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day in clay loam and sandy loam soils, respectively. At 27 °C, this rate increased to 0. 629 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day in clay loam soil and to 0. 652 in sandy loam soil. A similar trend was observed for poliovirus at 15 °C (k = 0. 064 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day, clay loam; k = 0. 095 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day, sandy loam) and 27 °C (k = 0. 133 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day, clay loam; k = 0. 154 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day, sandy loam). Neither MS 2 nor poliovirus was recovered after 24 h at 40 °C. No reduction of PRD- 1 was observed after 28 days at 15 °C and after 16 days at 27 °C. At 40 °C, the inactivation rates were 0. 208 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day in amended clay loam soil and 0. 282 <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> per day in sandy loam soil. Evaporation to less than 5 % soil moisture completely inactivated all three viruses within 7 days at 15 °C, within 3 days at 27 °C, and within 2 days at 40 °C regardless of soil type.

40|$|During the {{harvesting}} process, {{meat products}} can become contaminated with enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Surrogates for these pathogens {{would be beneficial}} for validating carcass decontamination treatments. Surrogate organisms are organisms that behave similarly to specific pathogens but are non-pathogenic {{and can be used}} to determine efficacy of decontamination regimes for pathogens. The surrogates proposed are non-pathogenic, ampicillin-resistant E. coli biotype I strains that were previously isolated from beef cattle hides. Each E. coli strain was transformed to express a fluorescent protein (red: EcRFP; green: EcGFP; yellow: EcYFP) that is detectable under an ultraviolet light source. Surface areas on hot boned beef carcasses (clod, brisket, outside round) were inoculated with a fecal slurry containing EcRFP, EcGFP, EcYFP and rifampicin-resistant E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S.

Surface regions were then treated in a model spray cabinet using an initial water wash (28 ?C) followed by treatments using 2 % L-lactic acid (55 ?C), hot water (95 ?C at source) or a combination of the two. Treatments were compared for their effectiveness at reducing populations of inoculated (4. 7 to 6. 7 log CFU/cm 2) E. coli, S.

All decontamination treatments reduced the inoculated numbers of pathogens and surrogates to near or below the detection limit of 0. 5 log CFU/cm 2.

We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0. 05 % sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi 6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> in organisms after handwashing to the <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> without handwashing. Rinse water was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1. 94 - 3. 01 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> in E. coli concentration without, and 2. 18 - 3. 34 with, soil load; and a 2. 44 - 3. 06 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> in Phi 6 without, and 2. 71 - 3. 69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models.

The number of viable microorganisms was determined using a plate count method. The effect of AEW on bacterial cell morphology were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After treatment with AEW, a significant, about 3. 00 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Micrococcus luteus populations was observed. In the AEW treatment of pork, the highest reduction of total number of microorganisms (2. 1 <b>log</b> <b>reduction),</b> yeast and moulds (2. 5 - 2. 6 <b>log</b> <b>reduction),</b> and psychrotrophs (more than 1 <b>log</b> <b>reduction)</b> was observed after spraying with 0. 001 % NaCl subjected to 10 min electrolysis. SEM revealed disruption and lysis of E. coli and S. aureus cells treated with AEW, suggesting a bactericidal effect. Higher available chlorine concentration (0. 37 - 8. 45 mg/L), redox potential (863. 1 - 1049. 8 mV), and lower pH (2. 73 - 3. 70) had an influence on the shape of bacteria and the number of breaks in the bacterial membrane...|$|E

Our best results achieved a noteworthy 5 – 6 <b>log</b> unit <b>reduction</b> in CFU at 0. 1 μM for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC- 2913), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC- 44), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC- 2320), a 4 – 5 <b>log</b> unit <b>reduction</b> for Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC- 19606 (0. 25 μM), multidrug resistant A. baumannii ATCC- 1605 (0. 1 μM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC- 97 (0. 5 μM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC- 2146 (1 μM), and a 3 <b>log</b> unit <b>reduction</b> for Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2155 (ATCC- 700084). A 5 <b>log</b> unit <b>reduction</b> in CFU was observed for Candida albicans ATCC- 90028 (1 μM) and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC- 64538 (0. 5 μM), and a 3 <b>log</b> unit <b>reduction</b> was noted for Candida glabrata ATCC- 15545 (1 μM). Infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0. 1 μM), by 5 log units (0. 5 μM) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 μM) in human adenovirus- 5.

Three grades of DE from two manufacturers {{were used in the}} tests. Reduction was measured using seeded river water applied to Walton test filters. Tests were run for filtration rates of 1 and 2 gpm/sq ft (2. 4 and 4. 9 m/h). Each run was replicated three times, and quality control was rigorous. Approximately 6 <b>logs</b> of <b>reduction</b> in the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts can be expected under routine operating conditions using DE grades having permeability of 3 ̆c 1. 2 Darcy. <b>Log</b> <b>reductions</b> varied predictably according to the permeability of the DE grade and the filtration rate; they were significantly higher at the higher filtration rate.

40|$|This study {{measured}} and compared different temperatures and dwell times {{of hot water}} treatment on the reduction of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Typhimurium on beef carcass surfaces. Two different types of beef surfaces, lean and fat, were inoculated with a fecal slurry containing E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium at ca. 7 -log CFU/g, washed to remove gross fecal matter, and rinsed with hot water between 66 and 82 degrees C (150 to 180 degrees F water) for either 5, 10, or 15 s. There were no differences (P > 0. 05) in the log reductions of S. Typhimurium and E. coli O 157 :H 7 on the lean surfaces for all three temperature treatments (66, 74, and 82 degrees C). Although the 15 s treatment resulted in a numerically higher <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> than the other treatments, each of the times resulted {{in at least a}} 1 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> of both S. Typhimurium and E. coli O 157 :H 7 for lean surfaces. For the fat surfaces, all time treatments for the 82 degrees C and the 10 and 15 s treatments for the 74 degrees C resulted in the highest <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> for S. Typhimurium. The 5 and 10 s dwell times for treatments at 66 degrees C and the 5 s dwell time at 74 degrees C resulted in the lowest <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> of S. Typhimurium and E. coli O 157 :H 7. For E. coli O 157 :H 7 all temperature and time treatments resulted in at least a 1 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> for the fat surfaces of the outside round. Therefore, hot water treatment is a proven method for reducing both coliforms and pathogenic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|A {{heat shock}} {{pre-treatment}} of Clostridium perfringens provides protection against lethality from subsequent exposure to cold shock and vice versa. Heat shocked cells were more cold tolerant (one <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> in 65 min) than control cells (one <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> in 34 min). On the other hand, cold-shocked cells were more thermotolerant (D 55 = 17 min) {{than the control}} (D 55 = 6. 5 min). The addition of chloramphenicol (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) in the experiments indicates that synthesis of new proteins was necessary for cross protection between both treatments.

40|$|The photo-induced {{reactivity}} of three nanostructured titanium dioxides including TiO 2 nanoparticles (i. e., nano-TiO 2), titania-silica aerogel and nanotextured TiO 2 film, were investigated for gas phase photocatalytic oxidation of trichloroethylene and inactivation of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli microbial cells. A correlation was observed between photoreactivity, for TCE conversion and bactericidal activity within TiO 2 of similar nanostructures and composition (i. e., elemental and phase). This {{indicates that the}} photogenerated radical species from UV-irradiated TiO 2 responsible for TCE photo-oxidation also {{play a major role}} in the inactivation of microbial cells. The superb bactericidal activities of titania-silica aerogels (i. e., up to 6 log reductions in viable B. subtilis) and nanotextured TiO 2 film (3. 4 <b>log</b> <b>reduction)</b> compared to commercial Degussa P 25 TiO 2 (0. 64 <b>log</b> <b>reduction)</b> and optimum nano-TiO 2 (1. 3 <b>log</b> <b>reduction)</b> far exceeds the observed activity enhancement for TCE photo-oxidation. This implies that nanoscale chemical and structural environment also contribute towards the bactericidal activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of two spray-based decontamination methods for surface contamination reduction and to determine the potential for contamination spread by these methods. Methods and Results: Material coupons (treated plywood and concrete) were contaminated with c. 1 × 107 spores of Bacillus atrophaeus by aerosol deposition. Decontaminants (pH-adjusted bleach or Spor-Klenz® RTU) were applied to coupons by either backpack sprayer or gas-powered sprayer. Contact time, reapplication frequency and rinse method were also varied. In addition to surface removal efficacy, partitioning of contamination between the rinsate and aerosol fractions was determined. Results indicated that pH-adjusted bleach was effective (≥ 6 <b>logs</b> <b>reduction)</b> when two applications and a 30 min contact time were administered, regardless of the decontaminant application method or material. Spor-Klenz® RTU was effective on wood, but achieved ≤ 3 <b>logs</b> <b>reduction</b> on concrete. A shortened application procedure with pH-adjusted bleach resulted in lower efficacy on wood, and a greater apparent potential for contamination spread. Conclusions: Consideration of material surface type is important when selecting a decontaminant. Also, achieving conditions that effectively inactivate surface biological contamination are critical to preventing the spread of contamination. Significance and Impact of the Study: Results presented here are intended to help development of remediation plans following a biological contamination incident...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} substituents on the {{photochemical}} and biological properties of tetraphenylporphyrin-based photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) {{as well as}} photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms (PDI) was examined. Spectroscopic and physicochemical properties were related with therapeutic efficacy in PDT of cancer and PDI of microbial cells in vitro. Less polar halogenated, sulfonamide porphyrins were most readily taken up by cells compared to hydrophilic and anionic porphyrins. The uptake and PDT of a hydrophilic porphyrin was significantly enhanced with incorporation in polymeric micelles (Pluronic L 121). Photodynamic inactivation studies were performed against Gram-positive (S. aureus, E. faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens) and fungal yeast (C. albicans). We observed a 6 <b>logs</b> <b>reduction</b> of S. aureus after irradiation (10 J/cm 2) {{in the presence of}} 20 μM of hydrophilic porphyrin, but this was not improved with incorporation in Pluronic L 121. A 2 - 3 <b>logs</b> <b>reduction</b> was obtained for E. coli using similar doses, and a decrease of 3 - 4 logs was achieved for C. albicans. Rational substitution of tetraphenylporphyrins improves their photodynamic properties and informs on strategies to obtain photosensitizers for efficient PDT and PDI. However, the design of the photosensitizers must be accompanied by the development of tailored drug formulations...|$|R
