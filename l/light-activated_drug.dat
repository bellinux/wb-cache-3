40|$|ABSTRACT: Lanthanide-doped photon upconverting nanoma-terials are {{emerging}} as {{a new class of}} imaging contrast agents, providing numerous unprecedented possibilities in the realm of biomedical imaging. Because of their ability to convert long-wavelength near-infrared excitation radiation into shorter-wave-length emissions, these nanomaterials are able to produce assets of low imaging background, large anti-Stokes shift, as well as high optical penetration depth of light for deep tissue optical imaging or <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> release and therapy. The aim of this review is to line up some issues associated with conventional fluorescent probes, and to address the recent advances of upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a solution to multiscale biological imaging applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a {{non-invasive}} {{treatment for}} different pathologies, cancer included, using three key components: non-toxic <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> (Photosensitizer, PS), visible light, and oxygen. Their interaction triggers photochemical reactions leading to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation, that mediate cytotoxicity and cell death. In the present paper, {{the most important}} findings about the synthetic dye Rose Bengal Acetate (RBAc), an emerging photosensitizer for its efficient induction of cell death, will be reported with the aim to integrate RBAc phototoxicity to novel therapeutic PDT strategies against tumour cells. After its perinuclear intracellular localization, RBAc causes multiple subcellular organelles damage, that is, mitochondria, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and Golgi complex. Indeed, RBAc exerts long-term phototoxicity through activation of both caspase-independent and- dependent apoptotic pathways and autophagic cell death. In particular, this latter cell death type may promote cell demise when apoptotic machinery is defective. The deep knowledge of RBAc photocytotoxicity will allow to better understand its potential photomedicine application in cancer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{examined}} {{the concept of}} a novel prodrug strategy in which anticancer drug can be locally released by visible/near IR light, taking advantage of the photodynamic process and photo-unclick chemistry. Our most recently formulated prodrug of combretastatin A- 4, Pc-(L-CA 4) 2, showed multifunctionality for fluorescence imaging, <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> release, and the combined effects of PDT and local chemotherapy. In this formulation, L is a singlet oxygen cleavable linker. Here, we advanced this multifunctional prodrug by adding a tumor-targeting group, folic acid (FA). We designed and prepared four FA-conjugated prodrugs 1 − 4 (CA 4 -L-Pc-PEGn-FA: n = 0, 2, 18, ∼ 45) and one non-FA-conjugated prodrug 5 (CA 4 -L-Pc-PEG 18 -boc). Prodrugs 3 and 4 had a longer PEG spacer and showed higher hydrophilicity, enhanced uptake to colon 26 cells via FR-mediated mechanisms, and more specific localization to SC colon 26 tumors in Balb/c mice than prodrugs 1 and 2. Prodrug 4 also showed higher and more specific uptake to tumors, resulting in selective tumo...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The growing {{resistance}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to conventional antimicrobial agents necessitates {{the development of}} alternative approaches to preventing and treating infections. One such approach is photodynamic therapy, whereby target cells are treated with <b>light-activated</b> <b>drugs</b> (photosensitizers). This investigation aimed {{to determine whether the}} ability of MRSA to express the IgG-binding protein, protein A, could be exploited to enable selective lethal photosensitization of the organism with a photosensitizer [tin (IV) chlorin e 6; SnCe 6] linked to IgG. Methods. Various strains of MRSA were exposed to light from a helium/neon laser in the presence of an IgG–SnCe 6 conjugate and the survivors enumerated by viable counting. Controls consisted of suspensions irradiated in {{the presence or absence of}} the conjugate and suspensions kept in the dark in the presence of the conjugate. Similar experiments were also carried out using the unconjugated photosensitizer. The experiments were repeated using a suspension consisting of both EMRSA- 16 and Streptococcus sanguis. Results.

40|$|International audiencePhotodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is now a}} {{well-established}} treatment modality for cutaneous carcinomas {{and is based on}} the administration of a <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> followed by illumination of the pathological area. The treatment of metastatic melanoma remains a therapeutic challenge. To define the possible role of melanin in relative phototoxicity of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA), a photosensitizer used in PDT in vivo, we studied cell death in two variants (with or without melanin, B 16 F 10 and B 16 G 4 F cells, respectively) of a melanoma cell line. Concentrations of 5 -Ala up to 10  mM induced similar cytostatic effects in the B 16 G 4 F and B 16 F 10 cells. PDT and high 5 -ALA concentrations induced photocytotoxicity in both melanoma cell lines (at 10  mM for B 16 F 10 cells and at 5  mM for B 16 G 4 F cells). Cell death corresponded to p 53 -dependent apoptotic signaling in pigmented B 16 F 10 cells, whereas an autophagic response leading to a caspase-independent death was detected in non-pigmented B 16 G 4 F cells. Therefore, the PDT-induced cell death pathway appeared to correlate with melanin synthesis capacity in melanoma cells. To reduce the cytotoxicity of 5 -ALA without irradiation, a low drug concentration could be used. Consequently, in combination with current therapeutics, a moderate concentration of 5 -ALA and PDT may constitute a supplementary promising approach to eliminate metastatic melanoma...|$|E

Larger-diameter vessels remained patent. Repetition of these data with a much more sensitive camera revealed occlusion of the treated area after 5 min with doses of verteporfin and light similar to those used clinically.

40|$|AbstractPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{clinical}} approach that utilizes <b>light-activated</b> <b>drugs</b> {{for the treatment}} of a variety of pathologic conditions. The initiating events of PDT-induced apoptosis are poorly defined. It has been shown for other pro-apoptotic stimuli that the integral endoplasmic reticulum protein Bap 31 is cleaved by caspases 1 and 8, but not by caspase- 3. Further, a 20 kDa Bap 31 cleavage fragment is generated which can induce apoptosis. In the current report, we sought to determine whether Bap 31 cleavage and generation of p 20 is an early event in PDT-induced apoptosis. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, involvement of caspases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 and the status of several known caspase substrates, including Bap 31, were evaluated in PDT-treated HeLa cells. Cytochrome c appeared in the cytosol immediately following light activation of the photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A. Activation of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 8 was evident within 1 – 2 h post PDT. Processing of caspases 1, 2, 4, and 10 was not observed. Cleavage of Bap 31 was observed at 2 – 3 h post PDT. The caspase- 3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk blocked caspase- 8 and Bap 31 cleavage suggesting that caspase- 8 and Bap 31 processing occur downstream of caspase- 3 activation in PDT-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm is a primary event following PDT, preceding caspase activation and cleavage of Bap 31. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a chemotherapeutic agent inducing caspase- 8 activation and demonstrates that caspase- 8 activation can occur after cytochrome c release...|$|R
40|$|The photophysical {{properties}} of porphyrins have relevance {{for their use}} as <b>light-activated</b> <b>drugs</b> in cancer treatment and sensitizers in solid-state solar cells. However, the appearance of their UV-visible spectra is usually explained inadequately by qualitative molecular-orbital theories. We intend {{to gain a better}} insight into the intense absorption bands, and excited-state dynamics, that make porphyrins appropriate for both of these applications by gradually building toward an understanding of the macrocyclic structure, starting with studies of smaller pyrrolic subunits. We have recorded the (1 + 1) and (2 + 1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectra of pyrrole and 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrole between 25 [*] 600  cm − 1 (390 nm) and 48 [*] 500  cm − 1 (206 nm). We did not observe a (1 + 1) REMPI signal through the optically bright B 1 2 (ππ ∗) and A 1 1 (ππ ∗) states in pyrrole due to ultrafast deactivation via conical intersections with the dissociativeA 1 2 (πσ ∗) and B 1 1 (πσ ∗) states. However, we did observe (2 + 1) REMPI through Rydberg states with a dominant feature at 27 [*] 432  cm − 1 (two-photon energy, 54 [*] 864  cm − 1) assigned to a 3 d←π transition. In contrast, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrole has a broad and structured (1 + 1) REMPI spectrum between 36 [*] 000 and 42 [*] 500  cm − 1 as a result of vibronic transitions to the B 1 2 (ππ ∗) state, and it does not show the 3 d←π Rydberg transition via (2 + 1) REMPI. We have complemented the experimental studies by a theoretical treatment of the excited states of both molecules using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and accounted for the contrasting features in the spectra. TD-DFT modeled the photochemical activity of both the optically dark π 1 σ ∗ states (dissociative) and optically bright π 1 π ∗ states well, predicting the barrierless deactivation of the B 1 2 (ππ ∗) state of pyrrole and the bound minimum of the B 1 2 (ππ ∗) state in 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrole. However, the quantitative agreement between vibronic transition energies and the excited-state frequencies calculated by TD-DFT was hampered by inaccurate modeling of Rydberg orbital mixing with the valence states, caused by the lack of an asymptotic correction to the exchange-correlation functionals used...|$|R
40|$|On-demand drug {{delivery}} systems {{have the potential}} to optimise {{drug delivery}} by allowing drug administration as required. Lipid-based liquid crystalline matrices (LC) are increasingly explored as a means of controlled release drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and ability to incorporate and control the release drugs of a wide ranging size and polarity. The rate at which drug is released is ultimately determined by the mesophase nanostructure. This inbuilt ‘on-off’ switch for drug release affords the opportunity to manipulate drug delivery by influencing lipid packing by e. g. changing temperature. The utilisation of advanced synchrotron SAXS has allowed for the understanding of mechanisms by which transformations between lipid self-assembled structures take place. Understanding these interactions is essential in the development of self-assembled matrices for many bioapplications. <b>Light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems have potential to provide a selective and non-invasive approach to accessing tissues that are not amenable to direct treatment. This thesis presents LC matrices which have been rendered light responsive by incorporation of additives that alter lipid packing upon irradiation and the effect of manipulating nanostructure on the release of drug from these matrices. Two approaches have been taken: 1. Photothermal Gold nanorods were incorporated into LC matrices and irradiation with near infrared laser light induced reversible thermotropic phase transitions via a photothermal effect. 2. Photochromic Photochromic compounds that undergo isomerisation in response to irradiation were incorporated into liquid crystalline systems where UV light induced a steric disturbance in the liquid crystalline nanostructure. The potential of these optically addressable nanostructures as reversible ‘on-demand’ drug delivery systems will translate into novel treatments for diseases such as macular degeneration.

40|$|Abstract Loco-regional {{treatments}} play a {{key role}} in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Image-guided tumor ablation is recommended in patients with early-stage HCC when surgical options are precluded. Radiofrequency ablation has shown superior anticancer effects and greater survival benefit with respect to the seminal percutaneous technique, ethanol injection, in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and is currently established as the standard method for local tumor treatment. Novel thermal and nonthermal techniques for tumor ablation [...] including microwave ablation, irreversible electroporation, and <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> therapy [...] seem to have potential to overcome the limitations of radiofrequency ablation and warrant further clinical investigation. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic, noninvasive multinodular tumors at the intermediate stage. The recent introduction of embolic microspheres that have the ability to release the drug in a controlled and sustained fashion has been shown to significantly increase safety and efficacy of TACE with respect to conventional, lipiodol-based regimens. The available data for radioembolization with yttrium- 90 suggests that this is a potential new option for patients with HCC, which should be investigated in the setting of randomized controlled trials. Despite the advances and refinements in loco-regional approaches, the long-term survival outcomes of patients managed with interventional techniques are not fully satisfactory, mainly because of the high rates of tumor recurrence. The recent addition of molecular targeted drugs with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties to the therapeutic armamentarium for HCC has prompted the design of clinical trials aimed at investigating the synergies between loco-regional and systemic treatments. The outcomes of these trials are eagerly awaited, because they have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of HCC...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{a method}} of {{treatment}} of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with a diode laser used after intravenously administered verteporfin. Verteporfin is a <b>light-activated</b> <b>drug</b> initiating photochemical reactions in the target tissue. This leads to the selective occlusion of {{blood vessels in the}} CNV with no damage of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium and retinal blood vessels. Objective To show the results of the treatment of predominantly classic subfoveal CNV with PDT with verteporfin used {{for the first time in}} our country. Method From 2003 to 2005, we treated 15 eyes in 15 patients using PDT and verteporfin, because of predominantly classic subfoveal CNV. If macular oedema was present as proved by fluorescein angiography, triamcinolone was administered intravitreally after PDT. Average follow-up period was 7 months (3 months to 2 years). Study design: retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. Results Two thirds of patients had CNV due to AMD, while in others it was caused by pathologic myopia, chorioretinitis, angioid streaks, choroidal hemangioma, except for one patient who had idiopathic CNV. Visual acuity was stabile in 60 % (9 / 15) of patients, of whom in 60 % (6 / 10) of patients with AMD, as well as in patients with pathologic myopia, idiopathic CNV and choroidal hemangioma. Retreatment with PDT was indicated in 40 % (6 / 15) and in 50 % (5 / 10) of patients with AMD, mostly 4 - 6 months after first PDT, but was done only in one patient (economic reasons). In two patients with AMD, triamcinolone was administered intravitreally for 2 - 4 months, which resulted in the stabilization of visual acuity. Conclusion Visual acuity was stabile in 60 % of all treated patients with predominantly classic subfoveal CNV after only one application of PDT with verteporfin during the average follow-up of 7 months (3 months to 2 years). Retreatment was indicated in 40 % of the treated patients, and in 50 % of patients with AMD. As confirmed, intravitreal administration of triamcinolone after PDT could stabilize visual acuity.
