5000|$|The 1995 presidential {{election}} {{was the first}} one for which the Constitutional Council had to appreciate the regularity of campaign accounts, in application of a law passed in January 1990. The Council examined the campaign accounts with what Jean-Claude Zarka, a professor of constitutional law, called [...] "obvious caution" [...] and Pierre Moscovici, the campaign treasurer of the socialist Lionel Jospin, [...] "eminent diplomacy". The campaign accounts of 8 candidates were approved, some with modifications, but those of Jacques Cheminade were rejected. According to Zarka, Cheminade was [...] "financed after the vote by substantial gifts from private persons". The ruling of the Council said 2.3 millions francs of private loans had to be qualified as gifts because of their relative importance in the accounts and the absence of interests. Moreover, 1.7 million francs, [...] "over a third of the total of his declared receipts", was contracted after the second round. Following the rejection of his accounts, Cheminade was deprived of the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of his campaign expenses and required to reimburse a million francs he had received from the state {{at the start of the}} campaign. In further observations, the Council recommended private loans to presidential candidates should be prohibited. Notwithstanding, Cheminade claimed the Civil code did not require a loan to bear interest, an assertion later confirmed by a lawyer specialized in civil law consulted by Le Journal du Dimanche. He also claimed Roland Dumas, the president of the Council, had a conflict of interest with him, having represented his opponents in a libel case some years earlier.|$|E
40|$|Since 2003 German {{hospitals}} are reimbursed according to diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Patient classification in neonatology is based inter alia on birth weight, with substantial discontinuities in reimbursement at eight di erent thresholds. These discontinuities create strong incentives to upcode preterm infants into classes of lower birth weight. Using {{data from the}} German birth statistics 1996 to 2010 and German hospital data from 2006 to 2011, we estimate that since the introduction of DRGs, hospitals have upcoded at least 12, 000 preterm infants and gained additional reimbursement in excess of 100 million Euro. The scale of upcoding in German neonatology enables us to study the anatomy of cheating in a profession that otherwise claims to have high ethical standards. We show that upcoding is not only positively linked with the strength of financial incentives but also with expected treatment costs measured by poor newborn health conditional on weight. This suggests that doctors and midwives do not indisriminately upcode any potential preterm infant as a rational model of crime would predict. Rather, they may {{find it easier to}} cheat when this helps aligning the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>reimbursement</b> with the expected actual treatment costs...|$|E
40|$|Virtually 100 % of the German {{population}} has health insur-ance. Of this 100 %,- 90 % {{are members of}} the Statutory Health Insurance plan. This insurance plan assumes re-sponsibility for practically all of the costs of treatment; self-participation bythe patient inthe costs is minimal. To coun-teract the financial deficits of the Statutory Health Insurance funds, the Health Care Reform Act was introduced in 1993, bringing with it massive economy measures for everyone involved inthe health sector. For the practitionersector, this new legislation provides for, among otherthings, revisionof the structure and the reimbursementof laboratories. In this context, the originally agreed-upon introductionof <b>lump-sum</b> payments as <b>reimbursement</b> for laboratory tests was abandoned, in the face of vigorous resistance by the med-ical profession. Instead, the system of reimbursement fo...|$|R
