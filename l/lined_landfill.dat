40|$|Landfill {{stability}} {{is one of}} the most important concerns in the landfill design and operation. Several slope failures in the past decade highlight the need for the detailed analysis of landfill stability. These failures are attributed to reasons such as heterogeneous composition, improper evaluation of shear strength parameters and the effects of mechanical creep and biodegradation on strength response as well as non-consideration of material variability issues. MSW properties vary due to heterogeneous nature, overburden pressure, and degradation. This heterogeneity and uncertainty in MSW characteristics makes the analysis and design of landfills complicated. In the present study, stability as well as deformation of a typical <b>lined</b> <b>landfill</b> is analyzed using the Mohr Coulomb model for MSW, implemented in FLAC 2 D. The objective is to demonstrate the influence of variability in strength and stiffness parameters on stability of MSW landfill slopes. To capture the effect of variability, response surface method (RSM) is used in conjunction with Mohr-Coulomb model to develop multi-linear relationships among all the design variables. The influence of variation of unit weight with depth on stability analysis of landfill systems has been particularly studied and discussed. Results show that reliability index decreases with increase in variability of parameters and consideration of unit weight variation with depth provides more reliable estimates of factor of safety and deformations...|$|E

Leachate from the landfill is collected and stored in two HDPE-lined ponds. The leachate is aerated and then land applied through a network of 21 fixed head rotary gun type sprinkler nozzles, to a 22. 25 acre spray field site of predominately reed canary grass. The landfill spray field is operated under MPCA SDS permit # SW 405. Nitrogen, as a constituent of concern (COC) is monitored along with other COCs in the leachate ponds, and in monitoring wells at the landfill boundaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Contemporary {{design of}} <b>lined</b> <b>landfills</b> in the United States {{began in the}} early 1980 ’s with Federal {{regulations}} focused on hazardous waste disposal. This regulatory framework was expanded to include municipal solid waste in the early 1990 ’s. With nearly 30 -years experience in the design of <b>lined</b> <b>landfills,</b> simple design practices have evolved to ensure the successful performance of <b>lined</b> <b>landfills.</b> Geosynthetic components {{play a critical role in}} the two main components of these landfills: (1) liners to limit the vertical migration of liquids, and (2) drainage field that collect the liquids and limit the potential for leaks to develop. Geomembrane liners provide a very stable barrier to the spread of liquids but must be built to very high standards, be protected from damage during construction and their service life, and come with the potential for stability problems generated by their slick surfaces. Geosynthetic drainage composites provide a means of draining the collected liquid from large areas of the liner surface. Properly designed, such geosynthetic drainage layers will add to the stability of the landfill by limiting hydrostatic forces due to the collected liquids. Past failures of <b>lined</b> <b>landfills</b> provide an effective means of demonstrating the inevitable consequences of not meeting fundamental design requirements for these components...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a ground water {{detection}} monitoring system at a <b>lined</b> <b>landfill</b> is complicated due to uncertainties in contaminant source characteristics and variability of hydrogeological conditions. Maximizing the likelihood of detecting contaminants and minimizing the contaminated area are the conflicting design objectives. Mostly, {{a large number of}} wells may be required to achieve the desired efficiency. However, the cost might be quite high from a practical point of view. Moreover, with the conventional monitoring approach, a widely applied three-well monitoring system (minimum regulatory requirement) is more often inadequate to accomplish these objectives at lined landfills due to the limited capture zone of monitoring wells. Therefore, implementation of a new monitoring approach has been proposed in this study to design a highly efficient, cost-effective, three-well system. In this new approach, the main idea is to increase the interception of con-taminant plumes at early stages by broadening the capture zone of monitoring well(s) simply by continuous pumping from the monitoring well(s) with a small pumping rate. A hypothetical problem is presented where a Monte Carlo framework is used to incorporate uncertainties due to subsurface heterogeneity and the leak location. A finite-difference ground water model coupled with a random-walk particle-tracking model simulates a contaminant plume released from the landfill for each Monte Carlo realization. The efficiency and the cost of the three-well monitoring network have been compared for con-ventional and proposed monitoring approaches (PMA). It has been observed that the efficiency of the monitoring system improves significantly by the application of the PMA...|$|E
40|$|There {{are over}} one {{thousand}} closed ‘small’ landfills in Ontario, each with differing circumstances and potential problems. This project proposes {{a method of}} addressing such dormant sites in situ, based upon {{a case study in}} Hamilton. 	Of the four closed landfills within Hamilton city limits, three of them lie in the low lands of the Red Hill Creek Valley. Perched at the source of the Red Hill Creek, the Upper Ottawa Street Landfill introduces unspoken toxins into the ecosystem of the entire valley. As the storm water catchment for the escarpment watershed, the creek serves a critical role in the recreational green belt which divides Hamilton and Stoney Creek. The source of this creek must be celebrated, not fenced off from public access due to landfill hazards. 	This proposal investigates beyond material recovery, into the possibilities of resource, ecosystem, and community recovery. Landfill mining, material sorting, and power generation through incineration are employed to reduce landfill volume. As the landfill is consumed, a new landscape is constructed, providing improved flood-prevention at the creek and a sanitary <b>lined</b> <b>landfill</b> for those materials remaining on site. 	Creek, forest, and field habitats are restored on site without the threat of contamination from landfill contents. The public can safely view the landfill mining operations from an elevated walkway, having new experiences with every visit. As the boundaries of the closed landfill are stripped away, the source of the Red Hill Creek and the new recreational parkland are made publicly accessible. 	Using this design as a reference, the equipment and operations designed for this site can be developed into a province-wide proposal...|$|E
40|$|Casella Waste Management has {{proposed}} {{to expand the}} landfill located in Coventry, Vermont, to accept 440, 000 tons of waste per year for approximately 20 years. The Memphremagog Regional Council (MRC) and representatives of various Quebec communities located on Lake Memphremagog have voiced opposition to the Coventry landfill expansion based on the potential for this expanded landfill to pollute Lake Memphremagog. This lake serves as the domestic water supply for 200, 000 people, mostly in Quebec. Casella Waste Management is quoted as having indicated that this proposed landfill expansion will be a state-of-the-art landfill that will be protective of Lake Memphremagog water quality. According to Mahoney (2004), “All they [the public] need is a little faith: y That Casella Waste Management will never accept any toxic materials in the 2500 tons a day (five days a week year 'round) that will be trucked to their Coventry landfill from all over Vermont and its neighbors. y That if by some weird circumstance toxic material does make {{its way to the}} landflll, his employees will never bury it [...] if they discover it, they will contain it and safely dispose of it. y That the plastic landfill liners will last forever and never leak toxic fluids into the drainage basin and thus into the lake from which some 200, 000 Canadian neighbors get their drinking water. y That if by some weird circumstance [...] say, an earthquake [...] the plastic membrane is breached, the compacted clay bottom will prevent the poisons from seeping into the lake. y That the drainage pipes that collect the millions of gallons of toxic leachate in the covered pits will never clog and will always work.

50|$|A coal ash basin or landfill, as {{the name}} implies, is an {{excavated}} basin for the disposal of coal ash to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Although the use of basins decreases the amount of airborne pollutants, basins pose serious health risks for the surrounding environment. Chemicals contained within samples of coal that do not burn are magnified in concentration within the coal ash. In general, coal ash basins are not <b>lined</b> <b>landfills,</b> and therefore chemicals in the ash can leach into the groundwater, lakes, rivers, and other freshwater sources, accumulating in the biomass of the system. Because of biomagnification, the concentration of these chemicals in animals will increase up a food chain (similarly to mercury in tuna). This can be very dangerous to humans that consume plant or animal life that has {{been affected by the}} coal basin. Some substances that can be commonly found in coal ash are arsenic, selenium, cadmium, nickel, lead, and mercury. Many of these, especially heavy metals, can have negative effects on humans when ingested. There are some initiatives, such as the one made by Duke Energy in 2015 to excavate existing coal basins to reduce the environmental effects of coal-burning power facilities on the surrounding environment.|$|R

40|$|Soils {{are often}} used to <b>line</b> <b>landfills,</b> lagoons, and tailing ponds to control the seepage of water, {{industrial}} waste products and hazardous fluids. These soil liners are required to have a low hydraulic conductivity and to remain effective {{for the life of}} the project. Permeability testing of soils with a low hydraulic conductivity is an important step in producing a soil liner that meets these requirements. A literature review indicated that the triaxial permeameter was the most suitable permeameter for permeability testing of soils with a low hydraulic conductivity. As a result two special triaxial permeameters were developed which could accurately measure hydraulic conductivity. A special feature of these permeameters was that hydraulic conductivity was measured in both flow in and flow out conditions which also allowed for the determination of volume change. All soils tested in the triaxial permeameters were saturated prior to testing by means of a combination of vacuum and backpressure. As well, flow rates were corrected for leakage from the triaxial permeability systems to produce more accurate determinations of hydraulic conductivity. The triaxial permeameters that were developed could accurately measure hydraulic conductivity as low as 2 xlO- 11 cm/sec. With the triaxial permeameters described above, the permeability characteristics of various compacted mixtures of sand-bentonite were studied. When the sand-bentonite mixtures were modeled under conditions typical of those on a soil liner, hydraulic conductivity generally decreased with time and with increasing gradient. This was the result of consolidation and the movement of clay particles within the voids of the sample. When the sand-bentonite was permeated with a saturated brine solution, chemical osmosis and the reduction in the thickness of the diffuse double layer of the bentonite caused an increase in hydraulic conductivity. Lastly, it was found that the minimum hydraulic conductivity of a compacted mixture of sand-bentonite was achieved when the mixture was compacted at a moisture content in the range of 1. 5 to 2. 0 percent wet of optimum...|$|R

FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told The New York Times that the ash should have been buried in <b>lined</b> <b>landfills</b> to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that [...] "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site." [...] Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA’s own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.“Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to try to make sure it never happens again,” he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. The site may be slated as a Superfund site, although no decision regarding this has yet been made. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told The Tennessean newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain [...] "hot spots" [...] of higher toxicity.|$|R

PG compaction and shear test results supported the hypothesis that compacted PG has sufficient geotechnical properties {{to serve as a}} foundation base layer under landfills. In this study, the hydraulic conductivity of compacted PG ranged from 2. 9 x 10 ^- 5 to 7. 3 x 10 ^- 5 cm/sec under a confining pressure of 69 to 345 kPa, higher than the 10 - 5 cm/sec required by Florida Landfill Rules for double <b>lined</b> <b>landfills.</b> Elevated concentrations of calcium, sulfate, and total dissolved solids (TDS) were observed in batch leaching solutions of PG with MSW landfill leachate. Elevated concentrations of calcium and sulfate may impact landfill leachate and gas quality. In column tests, the hydraulic conductivity of compacted PG with MSW landfill leachate ranged from 2. 8 x 10 ^- 5 to 6. 6 x 10 ^- 5 cm/sec, slightly higher than hydraulic conductivity measured using deionized (DI) water, which ranged from 1. 8 x 10 ^- 5 to 2. 7 x 10 ^- 5 cm/sec, but they were in the same order of magnitude of 10 ^- 5 cm/sec. The impact of MSW landfill leachate to compacted PG hydraulic conductivity was not significant. Significant cation exchange of sodium and potassium was found in the batch leaching solutions of GCL bentonite with MSW landfill leachate. A more significant exchange of calcium occurred in the batch leaching tests of GCL bentonite with simulated PG leachate. In the GCL hydraulic conductivity tests, the hydraulic conductivity of GCLs with simulated PG leachate ranged from 1. 2 x 10 ^- 6 to 3. 6 x 10 ^- 9 cm/sec, whereas with MSW landfill leachate the hydraulic conductivity ranged from 6. 4 x 10 ^- 6 to 1. 8 x 10 ^- 7 cm/sec. Both of these were higher than with DI water, which gave a hydraulic conductivity ranging from 2. 3 x 10 ^- 9 to 4. 1 x 10 ^- 9 cm/sec. The impact of food waste content on the MSW shear strength was studied by large-scale (430 mm ? 430 mm) direct shear test using synthetic MSW with different food waste contents (0, 20, 50, and 70 %). In the shear tests with different food waste contents, the internal friction angle of MSW ranged from 15 to 35 degree, and cohesion ranged from 5 to 12 kPa. The bi-linear internal friction angle envelope showed that if the food waste content in MSW is higher than 50 %, the internal friction angle could drop dramatically...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A correct waste {{containment}} philosophy consists of: (1) optimization of {{the landfill}} location, (2) construction of high performance lining and capping systems, (3) optimization of waste storage, (4) {{short and long}} term careful monitoring, and (5) a convenient re-use of the landfill area after closure. The geotechnical engineer has strong skills about all the aforementioned topics but in particular can effectively deal with the design, construction quality control and monitoring of the lining and cover systems, the waste storage and compaction procedure, and the foundation and improving treatments for constructions above waste deposits. Due to the large number of geotechnical aspects involved into the above listed issues, only the <b>lining</b> systems for <b>landfill</b> base and sides are illustrated in this chapter. These topics have been developed referring to their background, recent advancements and new trends. In particular, the fundamentals of updated design procedures are illustrated with particular reference to conceptual and practical modeling and assessment of related input parameters. Moreover the main literature references are provide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A pilot-scale {{experiment}} {{was set up}} in the laboratory with the purpose of investigating the most relevant aspects of the anaerobic digestion of municipal solid wastes (MSW), which are necessary for the preparation of future feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses. The experiment consisted of a comparative analysis among three different lines of operation, each one consisting of three anaerobic MSW reactors (with unit volume of 700 L) : conventional <b>landfill</b> (<b>line</b> 1), raw leachate recycling (line 2), and integrated treatment, with seeded leachate recycling (line 3). So, a UASB reactor was installed in the integrated treatment line with the purpose of removing the organic load of the leachate of the MSW reactors and utilising the biological sludge produced for inoculation of the waste digestion. The endogenous inoculation promoted in line 3, by means of recirculation of the leachate and return of the exceeding biological sludge produced in the UASB reactor, has favoured the initial fermentation stage and also the acceleration of the methanogenic phase...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} common {{practice}} to conduct numerical analyses {{to assess the}} stability and integrity of side slope <b>landfill</b> <b>lining</b> systems; however, {{information that can be}} used to validate such models is extremely limited. This paper contains data from a series of large-scale laboratory tests containing geosynthetic elements of a multilayered lining system exposed to downdrag forces from a compressible synthetic waste material (rubber crumb). These data are compared to the results from numerical analysis of the same problem. The numerical results are from initial best estimate analyses, with interface and synthetic waste properties derived from a laboratory testing programme and geosynthetic material properties from manufacturers. The observed trends of tensile stresses in the geosynthetics and relative displacements at interfaces in the laboratory testing are reproduced by the numerical models to an acceptable degree of accuracy that would be appropriate, using site-specific input data, for use in commercial design. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To {{help reduce}} {{leachate}} heads in <b>lined</b> and unlined <b>landfills,</b> vertical leachate abstraction wells are commonly used. The effectiveness of vertical wells in landfills is, however, often {{perceived to be}} poor and to deteriorate over time. To investigate possible reasons for this, a downwell closed-circuit television (CCTV) survey of 25 leachate wells was carried out. Observations revealed significant corrosion of steel well screens, although only within the permanently unsaturated zone. Within the saturated parts of the well, corrosion of the screen and clogging did not occur. No biological fouling was observed {{in any of the}} wells examined. Exhumation and examination of three steel well screens from a landfill demonstrated significant screen corrosion in the unsaturated zone, with up to a 6 mm loss in section. Within the saturated zone, the gravel pack from each well showed no evidence of biological clogging, but there was some invasion of the gravel by intermediate cover material in two wells that had been developed...|$|R
40|$|Geomembranes are {{sensitive}} {{and can be}} damaged caused by mechanical stresses. Mineral sealing liners and geomembranes together are used as basal composite <b>lining</b> systems in <b>landfills.</b> A protection layer has to avoid that big grains of the drainage layer damage the geomembrane. The project 'Geomembranes under Puncture Loads' had to develop suitable testing procedures to investigate the effect of geotextile protection layer and had to investigate the effect of geotextile protection layer with varied testing conditions. The aspects of selecting protection layers, the amendments concerning protection layers in regulations, types of protection layers in use and testing procedures in use are reported. The results of experimental tests (pressure tests with gravel and special penetrators) with varied testing conditions as load, temperature and time are described. Proposals for suitable testing procedures are given {{and the effect of}} geotextile protection layers is assessed. (orig.)
