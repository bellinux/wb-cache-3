The fourth reviewer, Theron Martin, gave two different opinions on the episode. He said that the change in tone and different art style will disappoint fans of the original series, while as a stand-alone show it might do better with its overall cutesy charm. Martin reviewed the complete series in 2015.

40|$|Perhaps {{the leading}} {{critique}} of the Dodd-Frank Act {{is that it does}} too little {{to address the problem of}} too big to fail (“TBTF”) financial institutions. The critique of TBTF institutions has two main components. The economic argument focuses on a major moral hazard problem. The political argument focuses on the political clout of TBTF institutions. There are important truths in both the economic and the political argument against TBTF institutions. However, there are also important limits to the truth of both arguments. I believe the limits are more central than the truths, and that if anything Dodd-Frank has gone too far in focusing on TBTF institutions. This paper first explores the truths and limits of the economic argument, and then does the same for the political argument. It then lays out a map for my own preferred approach to the TBTF problem. In the short run, we need relatively modest but firm regulation. Dodd-Frank <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> in many ways, but still needs some important fixes. The longer run is more daunting: we need to find ways to develop alternative financial and other institutions that are smaller and more focused on community and other stakeholder interests...|$|E

40|$|The year 2011 {{started off}} with low world stocks and {{improving}} commodity prices. The rising prices are largely due to challenging weather anomalies around the world reducing yield and quality. Combine this with an increasing world population, improved living standards and growing demands for livestock products which requires more grain production – and the future for Canada’s agricultural commodities <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good.</b> Similar to 2008, some market analysts are bullish on long-term commodity price increases. Sustained profitability is predicted {{based on the belief}} that global food demand will outstrip supply capacities. On the other hand, I’ve run across commentaries recently that question the prediction of “food scarcity”. There are several reasons why the minority of analysts believes the world will not face food scarcity challenges and is, in fact, optimistic about increasing supply and food availability. First of all, consider the real price of Canadian wheat over a 105 year period (Figure 1). Despite some annual market fluctuations, it is on a slow decline. Given the capacities of 21 st century technology, innovation and communication to increase production with improved efficiencies, why would this long-term trend reverse? There are management and technology innovations emerging that are already reducing the amount of fossil-fuel based fertilizers and crop protection products per ton of grain or kilo of livestock. This is critical to the transformation towards a sustainable global food system. Secondly, there are substantial areas of quality farm land that are currently under-utilized; some obvious spots The UK Government’s 2011 Foresight Report estimates that the application of existing knowledge, management techniques and technology could increase average yields two to threefold in many parts of Africa, and twofold across the former Russian Federation...|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to immigration, a natural but {{complicated}} question to ask is: “Is immigration good for New Zealand?” There {{are a number of}} ways immigration affects New Zealand and New Zealanders, and a number of concerns and fears New Zealanders have about immigration. This report analyses the effects of immigration and how these effects should be considered in the immigration debate. It is a timely contribution given immigration is becoming a significant issue in the 2017 election. Due to the subjective nature of how many of the effects are viewed, this report cannot definitively say immigration is good for New Zealand. However, many popular concerns about immigration are overblown and benefits under-represented. Any policy change must be sensible and not reactionary. Despite having relatively large flows of migrants into New Zealand, we seem immune to many of the issues facing other countries. When {{it comes to}} immigration, we are doing it well. Overall, New Zealand’s experience with immigration is positive. Kiwis are very accepting of migrants, valuing both their economic and cultural contribution to New Zealand. Migrants too embrace New Zealand culture while adding their own unique flavour, and ultimately integrate successfully. Migrants place less pressure on housing markets than popular opinion seems to suggest, and the case for fixing housing markets is strong regardless of the immigration rate. Migrants’ effect on the New Zealand economy and labour market is broadly positive. It all <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good.</b> On balance, the available evidence suggests that New Zealand benefits from migration, {{or at the very least}} the country is not made worse off. The current policy settings look broadly fit for purpose, but policymakers should be vigilant to ensure this remains the case. Government should also consider reducing bureaucratic drag in the immigration system. Measures such as letting high salaries count towards a migrant’s point tally, and letting private businesses sponsor migrants could ease some of the red tape that keeps high quality migrants from moving here. New Zealand also needs to jump on opportunities for bilateral free movement agreements with other countries. Lastly, where there are concerns that migration imposes a burden on local infrastructure, Government could consider imposing an upfront levy on migrants...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to; 1) to analyze the {{performance}} of Kelurahan Gedawang; 2) to know the inhibiting factors of organization performance of Gedawang Urban Village; and 3) to know the supporting factor of organizational performance of Kelurahan Gedawang Kota Semarang. This research uses qualitative approach with in-depth interview method. The theory used to describe the performance of the Kelurahan Gedawang organization is from Bernardin, which divides the performance based on 6 (six) criteria, namely; Quality, Quantity, Timeliness, Cost-effectiveness, Need for supervision, and Interpersonal impact. While narasumner used as many as 5 (five) people, namely Head of Kelurahan Gedawang; Secretary of Kelurahan Gedawang; Head of Public Service Section of Kelurahan Gedawang; Head of Community Welfare Section of Kelurahan Gedawang; and Head of Community Empowerment and Development Section of Kelurahan Gedawang. The finding of this research is that in doing service to society, can be seen from 6 (six) dimension of performance used by measure. From the quality dimension, the performance of the apparatus has not met the target. The quantity dimension shows that of the 43 planned activities, there are 37 activities that have been realized. The dimension of timeliness shows some of the programs already and is still ongoing, such as the making of tourist forests equipped with mushala, tennis and volleyball courts, tool warehouses, and workhouses; from the visible dimension of the lack of signage (guided explanation of the place) in Gedawang Village, making it difficult for people outside Gedawang to find the location in question. From the dimension of Need for supervision, it appears that the funds already allocated and already spent on tourism forests have turned out to be ambiguous due to the decline of Forestry Minister Regulation which prohibits that forests and zoos are managed by the government, even though they have absorbed substantial funds. From the dimensions of Interpersonal impact <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> because it is able to attract private parties to help build a playground in the Village Gedawang.
