60|$|Seeing {{the group}} they made this evening, one could hardly wish {{them to change}} their way of life. They were all alike small, and so in due {{proportion}} to their miniature rooms. Mrs. Meyrick was reading aloud from a French book; she was a lively little woman, half French, half Scotch, with a pretty articulateness of speech that seemed to make daylight in her hearer's understanding. Though she was not yet fifty, her rippling hair, covered by a quakerish net cap, was chiefly gray, but her eyebrows were brown as the bright eyes below them; her black dress, almost like a priest's cassock with its rows of buttons, suited a neat figure hardly five feet high. The daughters were to match the mother, except that Mab had Hans' light hair and complexion, with a bossy, irregular brow, and other quaintnesses that reminded one of him. Everything about them was compact, from the firm coils of their hair, fastened back à la Chinoise, to their gray skirts in Puritan nonconformity with the fashion, which at that time would have demanded that four feminine circumferences should fill all the free space in the front parlor. All four, {{if they had been}} wax-work, might have been packed easily in a fashionable lady's traveling trunk. Their faces seemed full of speech, as if their minds had been shelled, after the manner of horse-chestnuts, and become brightly visible. The only large thing {{of its kind in the}} room was Hafiz, the Persian cat, comfortably poised on the brown <b>leather</b> <b>back</b> of a chair, and opening his large eyes now and then to see that the lower animals were not in any mischief.|$|E

50|$|Limb armor {{consisting}} of strips of metal ("splints") {{are attached to}} a fabric (cloth or <b>leather)</b> <b>backing</b> ("foundation"). The splints are narrow metal strips arranged longitudinally, pierced for riveting or sewing to the foundation. Splint armour is most commonly found as greaves or vambraces.

Unlike scale armour, which it resembles, lamellar armour is not attached to a cloth or <b>leather</b> <b>backing</b> (although it is typically worn over a padded undergarment).|$|R

Notable items include his oak-framed Hunting Chair (1950) with a strong <b>leather</b> <b>back</b> and seat, his light, open Spokeback Sofa (1945), and the low robust Spanish Chair (1959).|$|E

It is also remarkable {{the length of the}} table and carved chairs which have a <b>leather</b> <b>back</b> stamped with the Pizarro's shield in gold. The lining of the chairs has different colors for men and women. Paintings by Abraham Brughel and Gerónimo Cenatiempo decorate this unique place.|$|E

It is also home to dolphins and once in a while, the passage of the world's biggest fish: the whale shark or the butanding, as the locals call it may be observed.

50|$|While a plug {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with most any harness, just by inserting the plugs before putting on the harness, all the harness tends to do is push the plugs in, and not move them as to provide stimulation when the wearer thrusts. Depending on the type of harness, different ways are used to properly attach plugs to the harness. A common type consists of an opening or rubber ring with a cloth or <b>leather</b> <b>back,</b> similar to what might be used to hold the main dildo {{to the front of the}} harness, but positioned over the anus, vagina, or ones for both. A dildo/plug with a wide base is inserted through the ring, then when the harness is put on, the material pulls tight against it, holding it firm. For vac-u-lock harnesses, one or two additional vac-u-lock plugs are mounted on the inside of the harness, allowing any vac-u-lock attachment to be used. Most vac-u-lock harnesses that have the connectors for internal plugs come with two plug-shaped vac-u-lock attachments, a smaller one for anal use and a larger one for vaginal use. Like other types of harnesses, both plugs may be used at once, and often are separately adjustable on the strap to fit the wearer's body.|$|E
