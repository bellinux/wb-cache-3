5|$|In September 2009, {{the company}} {{announced}} that as of March 31, 2010, PokerTracker Holdem v2 would no <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> supported.

The company felt that discontinuing support of v2 would avail resources which could be dedicated to improving PT3 and providing exceptional customer service. Similarly on December 31, 2010, PokerTracker Omaha v2 will also no <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> supported, as its features have been completely integrated into the PokerTracker 3 product line.|$|E

Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies.

There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> a deterrent.|$|E
