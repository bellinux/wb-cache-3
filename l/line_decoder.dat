40|$|We {{describe}} and investigate an optical system {{which we call}} an optical expander. An optical expander electrooptically expands an optical boolean pattern encoded in d bits into an optical pattern of size N bits. Each expanded pattern {{is one of the}} N mutually orthogonal boolean patterns. We wish the expansion to be exponential, so we have d = clog N for some constant c. An optical expander can be viewed as either an electrooptical <b>line</b> <b>decoder</b> which converts d bits of optically encoded binary information to up to N unique optical outputs; or a digital beam de ector which de ects an input laser beam into one of N distinct directions with a control signal of d bits. We show that an optical expander can not be constructed by using linear optical systems, so a non-linear optical lter must be used. We describe two di erent architectures to implement an optical expander. One uses an optical matrix-vector multiplier and an array of Nthreshold devices. The other uses log N novel re ection/transmission switching cells. We then analyze these architectures in terms of size, energy requirement, and speed. Our optical expander can help develop various applications in electrooptical computing systems. In general, because of I/O constraints and the limited fan-in/fan-out of electrical circuits, the conventional VLSI technology is not suitable for building a large <b>line</b> <b>decoder.</b> On the other hand, conventional acoustooptic beam de ectors are bulky and limited by capacity-speed product. We show that as an electrooptical functional unit, the <b>line</b> <b>decoder</b> nds many applications in optical computing such as optical interconnects and optical memory. Thus, the design and development of optical expanders is vital to optical computing. Our optical expander utilizes high speed and high space-bandwidth product connections provided by optical beams in a volume, so it o ers fast and accurate operations. Holographic memory system and message routing systems are potential applications of the optical expanders, and are discussed to further motivate the design and development of optical expanders.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs involves {{the development of}} non-volatile memory technologies like Flash. As any kind of memories, embedded Flash (eFlash) can be subjected to complex functional faults {{that are related to}} their particular technological process and to their integration density. In this paper, we address a major issue during eFlash testing, namely the test of Address decoder Faults (AFs), which is generally very time consuming with ad-hoc solutions presently used in industry. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we show the impact of AFs on the functional behavior of an eFlash. Next, we use an analogy with RAM memory testing to classify AFs with respect to their functional behavior. We then obtain AFs acting either as stuck-at faults or as state coupling faults. In the fourth part of the paper, we propose a concurrent approach for testing AFs acting on either the word <b>line</b> <b>decoder</b> or the bit <b>line</b> <b>decoder.</b> The proposed approach allows using a minimal number of programming operations during test application. Finally, we propose a compaction procedure to further reduce the test time of AFs. As a result, huge reductions in test time can be achieved; experiments on a 4 Mbits eFlash have shown that a test time reduction factor of 34 x can be obtained when compared to the global eFlash test flow presently used in industry. An additional important feature of the proposed strategy is that it allows testing 100 % of other critical faults in eFlashs (stuck-at, transition and state coupling faults) beside full coverage of AFs...|$|E

50|$|Many decoder designs avoid high-fan-in AND gates in the decode line {{itself by}} {{employing}} a predecode stage.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 20 - 23, 2003 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{receiver}} design for satellite ground station use which can demodulate a waveform without specific {{knowledge of the}} data rate, convolutional code rate, or line code used. Several assumptions, consistent with the Space Network operating environment, are made including only certain data rates, convolutional code rates and generator polynomials, and types of line encoders. Despite the assumptions, a wide class of digital signaling (covering most {{of what might be}} seen at a ground station receiver) is captured. The approach uses standard signal processing techniques to identify data rate and line encoder class and a look up table with coded sync words (a standard feature of telemetry data frame header) in order to identify the key parameters. As our research has shown, the leading bits of the received coded frame can be used to uniquely identify the parameters.

40|$|Abstract: Now a day‟s in signal {{processing}} multiplication {{is the most}} important arithmetic operation that uses look-up-table (LUT) as a memory for computations in arithmetic logic unit(ALU). LUT based computing is suitable for most of the digital-signal-processing (DSP) algorithms, which involves multiplication with a fixed set of coefficients. The design of multiplier requires huge number of logic gates in DSP, thus it occupies more area, delay and consumes large amount power. This paper aims to develop APC (Anti-symmetric product coding) and OMS (Odd Multiple Storage) techniques for reducing the size of the LUT and power consumption of the multiplier.

40|$|Modal {{multi-rate}} {{stream processing}} applications with real-time constraints which are executed on multi-core embedded systems often cannot be conveniently specified using current programming languages. An important {{issue is that}} sequential programming languages do not allow for convenient programming of multi-rate behavior, whereas parallel programming languages are insufficiently analyzable such that deadlock-freedom and a sufficient throughput cannot be guaranteed. In this paper a programming language is proposed by which a sequential specification {{of the behavior of}} an application can be nested in a concurrent specification. Multi-rate behavior can be conveniently expressed using concurrent modules which have well-defined, but restricted interfaces. Complex control behavior can be expressed in the sequential specification of the body of a module. The language is not Turing complete such that a Compositional Temporal Analysis (CTA) model can be derived. It is shown that the CTA model can be used despite the presence of control statements and that the composition of black-box components is possible. Algorithms with a polynomial time complexity can be used to verify whether throughput and latency constraints are met and to determine sufficient buffer capacities.

40|$|A digital {{electronic}} computer {{consists of two}} types of circuits, combinational and sequential logic circuits. The building blocks of combinational logic circuits are binary logic gates which act as the switching elements in a digital computer. The sequential circuits, on the other hand, are implemented by using flip-flops which act as the memory elements. In this thesis these basic most logic elements are designed and implemented optically for a digital optical processor based on the polarization-encoded optical shadow-casting (POSC) technique. Binary optical decoders have been designed in POSC scheme by using the POSC modified algorithm. The exclusive aspect of this design is that the multioutputs are always generated separately and simultaneously at the output plane. In particular a 3 -to- 8 <b>line</b> <b>decoder</b> and a BCD to an excess- 3 code converter have been developed The scope of multiple valued logic is explored in general and particularly in optics based computing.

The proposed system architecture is capable of implementing synchronous as well as asynchronous sequential circuits. The design and implementation of various flip-flops has been presented. The main features of these flip-flops is that various sequential operations are performed optically by utilizing optical feedbac...|$|E

The 74 HC 237 essentially combines the 3 -to- 8 decoder function with a 3 -bit storage latch. When the latch is enabled (LE = LOW), the 74 HC 237 acts as a 3 -to- 8 active LOW decoder. When the latch enable (LE) goes from LOW-to-HIGH, the last data present at the inputs before this transition, is stored in the latches. Further address changes are ignored as long as LE remains HIGH. The output enable input (E 1 and E 2) controls {{the state of the}} outputs independent of the address inputs or latch operation. All outputs are HIGH unless E 1 is LOW and E 2 is HIGH.
