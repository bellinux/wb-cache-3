50|$|Failed authorizations {{should result}} in an alarm {{or at least a}} timed lockout to prevent experimenting with {{possible}} codes. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. This feature is useful for permitting a single door to be opened and closed before the alarm is armed, or to permit a person to leave, but not return. High-end systems allow multiple access codes, and may even permit them to be used only once, or on particular days, or only in combination with other users' codes (i.e., escorted). In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. As with access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the <b>local</b> <b>alarm,</b> but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Holzter {{founded the}} company as [...] "Holtzer Co." [...] and began {{manufacturing}} simple electrical devices such as doorbells and electric igniters. In 1880, Seth W. Fuller partnered with Holzter, and the company became known as [...] "Seth W. Fuller & Holtzer", and later as [...] "Fuller, Holtzer & Company". George E. Cabot joined the business, and Fuller left in 1889. The company then {{changed its name to}} [...] "Holtzer-Cabot", which remained their name until their closing. In 1891, the company built an electric car that sat four people and moved approximately 16 MPH. It was the first to feature a steering wheel, and is known as the first successful electric vehicle in America, though other unsuccessful prototypes had been built before. Around the turn of the 20th century, the company branched out to create various telephone/telegraph-related products, clocks, and fire alarm systems. They invented the first shunt-type fire alarm system, where a <b>local</b> <b>alarm</b> pulled in a building would also trigger the nearest municipal street fire alarm box. Most of their fire alarm systems were installed in hospitals, factories, and institutions. In 1927, Charles Holtzer died. Throughout World War II, the company branched out even more, but struggled to retain business. In 1972, the company officially closed its doors, and sold the remainder of their lines to Eastern Air Devices based in Dover NH (Now known as Electrocraft). The original factory in Jamaica Plain, MA still exists, but has now been converted to an apartment complex.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} application, the alarm output may be local, remote or a combination. <b>Local</b> <b>alarms</b> {{do not include}} monitoring, though may include indoor and/or outdoor {{sounders}} (e.g. motorized bell or electronic siren) and lights (e.g. strobe light) which may be useful for signaling an evacuation notice for people during fire alarms, or where one hopes to scare off an amateur burglar quickly. However, with {{the widespread use of}} alarm systems (especially in cars), false alarms are very frequent and many urbanites tend to ignore alarms rather than investigating, let alone contacting the necessary authorities. In short, there may be no response at all. In rural areas where nobody may hear the fire bell or burglar siren, lights or sounds may not make much difference, as the nearest emergency responders may arrive too late to avoid losses.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – For {{people who}} are {{suffering}} from epilepsy (both diurnal and noc-turnal) {{it is essential to}} have a system that can detect and alarm seizures in real-time. In this paper, we present a preclinical demonstrator for real-time detection of seizures based on heart rate. The system consists of a body hub (a smart phone having Bluetooth Low Energy and Android Operating System) and a MIO Alpha Watch which are connected via Bluetooth. The seizure detection application running on the body hub is using the output value of the heart rate to classify the data from the MIO Alpha. It can generate a <b>local</b> <b>alarm</b> followed by sending an SMS message when a seizure has been detected. The user has the possibility to set the alarm threshold for the absolute level of the heart rate, the temporal variation in the heart rate and to choose where to send the SMS. In addition, the application detects when the system is disconnected or when the sensor is not in contact with the skin. The preliminary results are en-couraging and the application is available for the public. ...|$|E

40|$|Birds cause {{considerable}} damage to horticultural crops in Australia each year. The playback of species-specific bioacoustic alarm stimuli {{has been one}} of the most promising methods suggested to deal with bird-problems. However, no published studies have tested this method on species of parrots, one of the main avian pests of crops in Australia and globally. Furthermore the effectiveness of this method might be reduced if alarm calls were played back that came from a non-local population. The Crimson Rosella species complex (Platycercus elegans), a parrot with considerable acoustic variation throughout its range, is considered a pest species of several commercial fruit crops. This study tested whether alarm calls from Crimson Rosellas were effective in reducing the activity of Rosellas in apple orchards. Three groups of bioacoustic stimuli were compared: control stimuli, <b>local</b> <b>alarm</b> calls and non-local alarm calls. Our results indicate that the playback of alarm calls from Crimson Rosellas is effective in reducing the activity of Rosellas in orchards over the period of study, and we did not find any difference between the use of local and non-local alarm calls. Our study suggests that playback of alarm calls may be an effective deterrent of rosellas over a broad distribution, at least for short- to medium-term use. <br /...|$|E

This portable system can be efficiently used for security against leakage of LPG, intruder detection and overheating. Some innovative power saving techniques has been implemented through the use of PIR sensor. Moreover, GSM acknowledgement of the parameters is achieved through the use of “SIM 900 GSM MODEM ” and a “BUZZER ” is used for <b>local</b> <b>alarm.</b> The readings and the status of the parameters are displayed on an LCD screen interfaced with the 8051 (AT 89 S 52) Micro-controller.

40|$|Uric acid is a {{waste product}} of purine catabolism. This {{molecule}} comes to clinical attention when it nucleates to form crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) in joints or other tissues, and thereby causes the inflammatory disease of gout. Patients with gout frequently suffer {{from a number of}} comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Why MSU crystals trigger inflammation and are associated with comorbidities of gout has been unclear, but recent studies provide new insights into these issues. Rather than simply being a waste product, uric acid could serve a pathophysiological role as a <b>local</b> <b>alarm</b> signal that alerts the immune system to cell injury and helps to trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses. The inflammatory component of these immune responses is caused when urate crystals trigger both inflammasome-dependent and independent pathways to generate the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1. The resulting bioactive IL- 1 stimulates the inflammation of gout and might {{contribute to the development of}} other comorbidities. Surprisingly, the same mechanisms underlie the inflammatory response to a number of irritant particles, many of which also cause disease. These new insights help to explain the pathogenesis of gout and point to potential new therapeutic targets for this and other sterile inflammatory diseases...|$|E

5000|$|A seminal event {{occurred}} in 1821, when {{the rise of}} Greek nationalism {{in various parts of}} the Balkans in connection with the Greek War of Independence led to occupation of the two states by the Filiki Eteria, a Greek secret society who sought, and initially obtained, Russian approval. A mere takeover of the government in Moldavia, the Eterist expedition met a more complex situation in Wallachia, where a regency of high boyars attempted to have the anti-Ottoman Greek nationalists confirm both their rule and the rejection of Phanariote institutions. A compromise was achieved through their common support for Tudor Vladimirescu, an Oltenian pandur leader who had already instigated an anti-Phanariote rebellion (as one of the Russian sudiți, it was hoped that Vladimirescu could assure Russia that the revolt was not aimed against its influence).

40|$|The {{universe}} {{in which we}} will be operating will be called a distributed computing environment. It consists of a finite collection E of computational entities communicating by means of messages. Entities communicate with other entities to achieve a common goal; for example, to perform a given task, to compute the solution to a problem, to satisfy a request either from the user (i. e., outside the environment) or from other entities. In this chapter, we will examine this {{universe in}} some detail. 1. 1 ENTITIES The computational unit of a distributed computing environment is called an entity. Depending on the system being modeled by the environment, an entity could correspond to a process, a processor, a switch, an agent, and so forth in the system. Capabilities Each entity x ∈ E is endowed with local (i. e., private and nonshared) memory Mx. The capabilities of x include access (storage and retrieval) to local memory, local processing, and communication (preparation, transmission, and reception of messages). Local memory includes a set of defined registers whose values are always initially defined; among them are the status register (denoted by status(x)) and the input value register (denoted by value(x)). The register status(x) takes values from a finite set of system states S; the examples of such values are “Idle, ” “Processing,” “Waiting,” [...] . and so forth. In addition, each entity x ∈ E has available a <b>local</b> <b>alarm</b> clock cx which it can set and reset (turn off).
