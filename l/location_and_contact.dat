40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{equilibrium}} model of office location, which explicitly considers {{the source of}} agglomeration economies and which sees firm <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> patterns as jointly and endogenously determined. We solve the model explicitly for contact-benefit, facility-cost, and transport-cost functions representative of medium-sized US cities. The resulting rent functions are concave rather than convex {{as they are in}} most models of industrial and residential location. The source of the concavity is that firms make contacts throughout the central business district (CBD). To determine the role of agglomeration economies associated with interfirm contacts, we alter the contact-benefit function, the transport-cost function {{and the size of the}} CBD. We find that agglomeration economies have a strong effect on location and, indeed, are often sufficiently strong to produce counterintuitive results. For example, an increase in transport costs causes a decrease rather than an increase in transport expenses, because in the city, which is now smaller, a firm decreases the number of contacts. Further, the increase in transport costs does not increase the relative attractiveness of the center. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{advent of}} sensor arrays {{providing}} tactile feedback with high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution asks for new control strategies to exploit this important and valuable sensory channel for grasping and manipulation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a control framework to realize {{a whole set of}} tactile servoing tasks, i. e. control tasks that intend to realize a specific tactile interaction pattern. This includes such simple tasks like tracking a touched object, maintaining both contact <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> force, as well as more elaborate tasks like tracking an object’s pose or tactile object exploration. Exploiting methods known from image processing, we introduce robust feature extraction methods to estimate the 2 D contact position, the contact force, and the orientation of an object edge being in contact to the sensor. The flexible control framework allows us to adapt the PID-type controller to a large range of different tasks by specification of a projection matrix toggling certain control components on and off. We demonstrate and evaluate the capabilities of the proposed control framework in a series of experiments employing a 16 × 16 tactile sensor array attached to a Kuka LWR as a large fingertip.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} two decades, concern has been {{expressed}} about the readiness {{of the public health}} workforce to adequately address the scientific, technological, social, political and economic challenges facing the field. A 1988 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) served as a catalyst for the re-examination of the public health workforce. The IOM's call to increase the relevance of public health education and training prompted a renewed effort to identify competences needed by public health personnel and the organizations that employ them. Methods A recent evaluation sought to address the role of the 10 essential public health services in job services among the Texas public health workforce. Additionally, the evaluation examined the Texas public health workforce's need for training in the 10 essential public health services. Results and conclusion Overall, the level of perceived training needs varied dramatically by job category and health department type. When comparing aggregate training needs, public health workers with greater day-to-day contact (nurses, health educators) indicated a greater need for training than their peers who did not, such as those working in administrative positions. When prioritizing and designing future training modules regarding the 10 essential public health services, trainers should consider the effects of job function, <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> with the public. </p...|$|E
40|$|Poster Presentations: S 1 -P 19 BACKGROUND: Variability {{in social}} {{behaviour}} {{such as the}} propensity to meet individuals and mix in groups must contribute to heterogeneities in the transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens, with data from questionnaire-based studies of these encounters now used routinely to inform age-specific parameters of transmission models. Although results from these models are being used with increasing frequency to inform the prioritisation of key resources such as vaccines, the association between self-reported social <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> infection has been quantified only for populations, not for individuals. METHODS: We embedded a questionnaire within a longitudinal cohort survey of influenza to test the strength of association between self-reported <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> serologically confirmed infection. We extracted variables related to individual <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> the <b>locations</b> at which contacts were made. RESULTS: <b>Location</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> were only weakly correlated. Using logistic regression, we found overwhelming support for models that included age over those that did not across a large set of social contact variables. The best models all included location variables. Estimated increases in risk of infection were ≈ 1 % per <b>location</b> <b>and</b> ≈ 15 % per contact. Although risk estimates were only marginally significant, both were consistent across many alternate models. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported social contacts did not explain age-specific patterns of infection. Therefore, pending additional empirical results, theoretical studies of interventions against respiratory pathogens should not assume a strong relationship between self-reported <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> force-of-infection without appropriate sensitivity analyses. Within age groups, a potentially strong association between number of <b>locations</b> <b>and</b> risk of infection suggests that many infections occur via the aerosol route. Also, if confirmed, the link between number of <b>locations</b> <b>and</b> infection could help improve plans to reduce {{the impact of a}} moderate or severe pandemic by precisely characterising a novel modifiable risk factor. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the allosteric tetrameric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbII) has been determined in the carbonmonoxy liganded state {{using a combination of}} anomalous scattering and molecular replacement. The molecular model has been refined at 2. 0 A resolution to a conventional R-factor of 0. 173 and a free R-factor of 0. 244. The tetramer is formed from two identical heterodimers. Each heterodimer is assembled with intersubunit contacts involving the E and F helices and heme groups {{in a manner that is}} very similar to that of the cooperative Scapharca homodimeric hemoglobin. In addition, the ordered water structure observed in these dimeric interfaces is quite similar. These structural similarities strongly suggest that the dimers within the Scapharca tetramer are cooperative. Subunits assemble into a tetramer in a distinctly non-tetrahedral arrangement, with the pseudo 2 -fold axes of the heterodimer oriented at an angle of 74. 5 degrees relative to the molecular 2 -fold. This arrangement requires that two subunit types have distinct <b>locations</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts,</b> despite the very similar tertiary structures.

Recently, there has been a rise of online journals characterized as ‘predatory’, which actively solicit manuscripts and charge publications fees without providing robust peer review and editorial services. We carried out a cross-sectional comparison of characteristics of potential predatory, legitimate open access, and legitimate subscription-based biomedical journals. Methods On July 10, 2014, scholarly journals from each of the following groups were identified – potential predatory journals (source: Beall’s List), presumed legitimate, fully open access journals (source: PubMed Central), and presumed legitimate subscription-based (including hybrid) journals (source: Abridged Index Medicus). MEDLINE journal inclusion criteria were used to screen and identify biomedical journals from within the potential predatory journals group. One hundred journals from each group were randomly selected. Journal characteristics (e. g., website integrity, look and feel, editors and staff, editorial/peer review process, instructions to authors, publication model, copyright and licensing, journal <b>location,</b> <b>and</b> <b>contact)</b> were collected by one assessor and verified by a second. Summary statistics were calculated. Results Ninety-three predatory journals, 99 open access, and 100 subscription-based journals were analyzed; exclusions were due to website unavailability.

What adds to the romance {{of the city and}} sets it apart from all of the others are the canals flowing between the different historical buildings. These canals are the natural dividers for the 110 mud flat islands that make up Venice and are the cornerstone for Venetian life. Not only are the canals the main mode of transportation, but they are also the foundation for all of the buildings along the canals. The walls lining the canals are subjected to stresses inflicted due to their <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> with the canal waters. These walls are deteriorating, leaving weak building structures and an aesthetically unpleasing appearance. There are many sources of the canal wall damage beyond the mere age of the buildings and materials; one of these sources is moto ondoso, or damage from boat wake. In open waters, the wake from boats can dissipate over a large area. In the canals and narrow waterways in the Venetian lagoon, however, there is less space and opportunity for the kinetic energy of the wave to be reduced before it strikes the canal walls.

This study aimed to identify acute cases of CCHF, and {{to determine the extent of}} previous exposure to CCHFV in an outpatient population attending Sangailu and Ijara health centers, Ijara District, North Eastern Kenya, presenting with acute febrile illnesses. A total of 517 human serum samples were collected from these patients. The samples were screened for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies to CCHF using CCCHF-IgG and IgM ELISA test kits. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to investigate the risk factors associated with evidence of exposure to CCHFV. A single patient tested positive for anti-CCHF IgM, while 96 were positive for anti-CCHF IgG. The seroprevalence of CCHFV was 23 % in Sangailu and 14 % in Ijara. Most exposed persons were aged 40 – 49 years. The likelihood of exposure was highest among farmers (29 %).
