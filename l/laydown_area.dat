40|$|To {{determine}} potential direct impacts {{from each}} project alternative on wetlands, improvement concept plans were overlaid with the GIS wetland mapping {{that was developed}} for this project and described in Section 7 : Wetlands (January 2011) of the Environmental Technical Memorandum (Tech Memo 1). Areas of overlap signified direct wetland impact zones, which were subsequently quantified and reported herein in square feet (SF) and acres (ac). For this impact analysis, all linear wetlands adjacent to the track (mapped as “ditch wetlands ” in Tech Memo 1) {{are assumed to be}} two feet wide as determined from field investigations. Direct permanent impacts could result from excavation and/or placement of structures and fill material within wetlands. Direct temporary impacts beyond the permanent impact zones could result from vegetation clearing, construction vehicle access, temporary water handling, material <b>laydown</b> <b>areas,</b> and equipment staging areas. Indirect impacts were assessed by considering the potential for off-site or delayed effects such as increases in water temperature and turbidity as a result of construction-related soil erosion and sedimentation of wetlands. In order to assess the loss or impairment of wetland functions and values associated with the project, the functions and values of potentially affected wetlands were assessed. Lost or reduce...|$|R
40|$|The Carrier Preparation Building Materials Handling System {{receives}} {{rail and}} truck shipping casks from the Carrier/Cask Transport System, and inspects and prepares the shipping casks for {{return to the}} Carrier/Cask Transport System. Carrier preparation operations for carriers/casks received at the surface repository include performing a radiation survey of the carrier and cask, removing/retracting the personnel barrier, measuring the cask temperature, removing/retracting the impact limiters, removing the cask tie-downs (if any), and installing the cask trunnions (if any). The shipping operations for carriers/casks leaving the surface repository include removing the cask trunnions (if any), installing the cask tie-downs (if any), installing the impact limiters, performing a radiation survey of the cask, and installing the personnel barrier. There are four parallel carrier/cask preparation lines installed in the Carrier Preparation Building with two preparation bays in each line, each of which can accommodate carrier/cask shipping and receiving. The lines are operated concurrently to handle the waste shipping throughputs and to allow system maintenance operations. One remotely operated overhead bridge crane and one remotely operated manipulator is provided for each pair of carrier/cask preparation lines servicing four preparation bays. Remotely operated support equipment includes a manipulator and tooling and fixtures for removing and installing personnel barriers, impact limiters, cask trunnions, and cask tie-downs. Remote handling equipment is designed to facilitate maintenance, dose reduction, and replacement of interchangeable components where appropriate. Semi-automatic, manual, and backup control methods support normal, abnormal, and recovery operations. <b>Laydown</b> <b>areas</b> and equipment are included as required for transportation system components (e. g., personnel barriers and impact limiters), fixtures, and tooling to support abnormal and recovery operations. The Carrier Preparation Building Materials Handling System interfaces with the Cask/Carrier Transport System to move the carriers {{to and from the}} system. The Carrier Preparation Building System houses the equipment and provides the facility, utility, safety, communications, and auxiliary systems supporting operations and protecting personnel...|$|R
40|$|The 100 -B- 1 waste {{site was}} a dumping site that {{was divided into}} two areas. One area {{was used as a}} <b>laydown</b> <b>area</b> for {{construction}} materials, and the other area was used as a chemical dumping area. The 100 -B- 1 Surface Chemical and Solid Waste Dumping Area site meets the remedial action objectives specified in the Remaining Sites ROD. The results demonstrate that residual contaminant concentrations support future unrestricted land uses that can be represented by a rural-residential scenario. The results also demonstrate that residual contaminant concentrations are protective of groundwater and the Columbia River...|$|E
40|$|The study {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} solution and lays {{the framework for}} developing a new, sophisticated and intelligent tool for a lunar base construction crew to use. This concept integrates expert systems for critical decision making, virtual reality for training, logistics and laydown optimization, automated productivity measurements, and an advanced scheduling tool to form a unique new planning tool. The concept features extensive use of computers and expert systems software to support the actual work, while allowing the crew to control the project from the lunar surface. Consideration is given to a logistics data base, <b>laydown</b> <b>area</b> management, flexible critical progress scheduler, video simulation of assembly tasks, and assembly information and tracking documentation...|$|E
40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) Program {{proposes to}} provide {{additional}} access to the Kirschbaum Field construction <b>laydown</b> <b>area.</b> This additional access would alleviate traffic congestion at the East Gate entrance to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) from Greenville Road during periods of heavy construction for the NIF. The new access would be located along the northeastern boundary of LLNL, about 305 m (1, 000 ft) north of the East Gate entrance. The access road would extend from Greenville Road to the Kirschbaum Field construction <b>laydown</b> <b>area</b> and would traverse an existing storm water drainage channel. Two culverts, side by side, and a compacted road base would be installed across the channel. The security fence that runs parallel to Greenville Road would be modified to accommodate this new entrance and a vehicle gate would be installed {{at the entrance of}} Kirschbaum Field. The exiting shoulder along Greenville Road would be converted into a new turn lane for trucks entering the new gate. This analysis evaluates the impacts of constructing the Kirschbaum Field bridge and access gate at a different location than was analyzed in the NIF Project specific Analysis in the Final Programmatic environmental Impact Statement for Stockpile Stewardship and Management (SS and M PEIS) published in September 1996 (DOE/EIS- 0236) and the Record of Decision published on December 19, 1996. Issues of concern addressed in this supplement analysis include potential impacts to wetlands downstream of the access bridge, potential impacts to the California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii) listed as threatened on the federal listing pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1974, and potential impacts on the 100 -yr floodplain along the Arroyo Las Positas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} to use a iron-based catalyst as a pyrolysis vapour conversion catalyst. The iron catalyst was also compared with the mineral dolomite. The experiments were facilitated at Cortus Energy's demonstration plant in Koping, Sweden, by in situ instal- lation of the experimental setup to an outlet of the pyrolyser unit. The pyrolysis vapour from Cortus Energy was converted {{for a total of}} 8 hours by passing it through a packed bed reactor containing the iron-based catalyst while sampling gas and oil from the feed for analysis. The outset for the operation on the dolomite catalyst bed was the same as for the iron catalyst with a resulting collapse of the bed when the pyrolysis vapour was introduced. The permanent gases were analysed on site with a µ-GC unit while oil samples were condensed and analysed with GC-MS, H-NMR and Karl Ficher titration. The carbon <b>laydown</b> and surface <b>area</b> of the catalyst was determined as well as the phase changes of the catalyst surface with XRD. The results showed clear indications of bio-crude conversion with an eightfold increase of the H 2 concentration of the synthetic gas from 3. 38 % to 26. 69 % on a dry gas basis. The oxygen to carbon (O:C) ratio decreased in the treated pyrolysis oil compared to the untreated oil while the hydrogen to carbon (H:C) ratio showed indications of dehydration of the oil. The gas and water content of the stream increased while 57. 2 % of the oil was converted in the process. Lastly, the iron-based catalyst did not seem to favour the conversion of alkylated phenols...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the NIF Site Management Plan is to {{describe}} the roles, responsibilities, and interfaces for the major NIF Project organizations involved in construction of the facility, installation and acceptance testing of special equipment, and the NIF activation. The plan also describes the resolution of priorities and conflicts. The period covered is from Critical Decision 3 (CD 3) through {{the completion of the}} Project. The plan is to be applied in a stepped manner. The steps are dependent on different elements of the project being passed from the Conventional Facilities (CF) Construction Manager (CM), to the Special Equipment (SE) CMs, and finally to the Activation/ Start-Up (AS) CM. These steps are defined as follows: The site will be coordinated by CF through Project Milestone 310, end of conventional construction. The site is defined as the fenced area surrounding the facility and the CF <b>laydown</b> and storage <b>areas.</b> The building utilities that are installed by CF will be coordinated by CF through the completion of Project Milestone 310, end of conventional construction. The building utilities are defined as electricity, compressed air, de-ionized water, etc. Upon completion of the CF work, the Optics Assembly Building/Laser and Target Area Building (OAB/LTAB) will be fully operational. At that time, an Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Program building coordinator will become responsible for utilities and site activities. * Step 1. Mid-commissioning (temperature stable, + 1 {degree}C) of an area (e. g., Laser Bay 2, OAB) will precipitate the turnover of that area (within the four walls) from CF to SE. * Step 2. Interior to the turned-over space, SE will manage all interactions, including those necessary by CF. * Step 3. As the SE acceptance testing procedures (ATPS) are completed, AS will take over the management of the area and coordinate all interactions necessary by CF and SE. For each step, the corresponding CMs for CF, SE, or AS will be placed in charge of the integrated activities within a space. That responsible manager will ensure that a work flow for people, equipment, and materials has been addressed and that a work plan has been formulated. The manager will also establish work priorities and resolve conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{simulation}} {{and traffic}} simulation are complementary to successful planning of microtunneling and pipe-jacking operations in urban areas. With increasing concerns on sustainable development, {{it is imperative}} to integrate construction engineering and traffic engineering in simulation modeling in order to plan for efficient site operations while reducing the impact of construction upon traffic. In this research, we demonstrate a “larger system simulation ” approach to effectively plan pipe-jacking operations in urban areas in considerations of (1) truck delivery routes and timing; (2) sizing and location of temporary <b>laydown</b> <b>area</b> on site; (3) traffic lane closure distance; and (4) working hours scheduling, aimed at minimizing the negative impact of construction on traffic. Our research goal is to deliver a temporary traffic arrangement plan along with an efficient site operations plan, thus keeping a balance between construction productivity and traffic mobility. A case study is given based on a pipe-jacking site in the urban area of Hong Kong. ...|$|E
