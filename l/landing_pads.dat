25|$|The PAVN {{siege of}} the vital Long Tieng base and its 20 Alternate air strip {{continued}} despite Operation Strength II. On 18 March 1972, the North Vietnamese took the refugee center at Sam Thong, near the guerrilla base. A force from the PAVN 165th Regiment pushed Thai mercenary Bataillon Commando 616 (BC 616) from helicopter landing pad Charlie Charlie on western Skyline Ridge on 19 March. The Vietnamese 335th Independent Regiment held {{the center of}} the ridgeline and its <b>landing</b> <b>pads.</b> Despite the diversionary attacks, of Strength II, with these Vietnamese troops perched overlooking Long Tieng, the 316th Division and 866th Independent Regiment were also poised for an assault to overrun the guerrilla base.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire Air Ambulance is a {{dedicated}} helicopter emergency {{service for the}} Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. It was introduced in 2000, and currently operates two Airbus H145 aircraft. The Yorkshire Air Ambulance is maintained by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance Trust, a registered charity. The air ambulance's flagship base is located at Nostell Priory and has <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> at various major hospitals around the region including Leeds General Infirmary, Hull Royal Infirmary and James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. In October 2007, a second base was opened at Sheffield City Airport. The airport then closed {{at the end of}} April 2008 but a heliport facility was still provided {{for the use of the}} air ambulance and the South Yorkshire Police helicopter. In November 2010, the operational base for the Sheffield-based aircraft was moved to Bagby Airport near Thirsk.|$|E

500|$|When {{the project}} finally became The Motion Picture, Robert Abel and Associates art {{director}} Richard Taylor wanted to completely redesign the ship, but Roddenberry {{insisted on the}} same shape as designed by Jefferies for Phase II. Taylor focused on the details, giving it a stylization he considered [...] "almost Art Deco". Concept artist Andrew Probert helped refine the redesign. The general shape and proportions of the Phase II ship were retained, but the angles, curves and details refined. Taylor took on the nacelles, and Probert {{the rest of the}} ship. Changes included [...] "radiator grill" [...] nacelle caps, a glowing deflector dish, a new impulse engine, new shapes for the aft end and hangar doors of the secondary hull, more docking ports, rounder windows, hatches, and windows for an observation lounge, recreation deck, and arboretum. Probert also replaced the Phase II ship weapons tube with a twin launcher torpedo deck and added elements such as features for a separating saucer and <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> that were never utilized on any film featuring the model.|$|E
2500|$|Main force confrontation. VC/NVA forces also faced American airmobile {{attacks in}} remoter areas, around their base camps and border sanctuaries. In these {{encounters}} NVA regulars and VC main-force units confronted their opponents, which sometimes included airlifted ARVN elements. Typically, such airmobile operations involved preparation of fire support bases, {{carved out of}} jungle terrain. Suitable areas (usually on high ground) were selected and heavily bombarded with artillery and airstrikes, then US engineers and security troops landed to commence construction of fortifications, bunkers, artillery emplacements and helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pads.</b> The ability of helicopters to transport all the needed men and heavy equipment to almost any location gave American arms tremendous power and flexibility. Several of these firebases could be built relatively quickly and deliver devastating mutually supporting supporting fire within a combat zone. [...] Under the artillery umbrella, Marine and army infantry deployed for combat. The versatility of helicopters enabled such forces to be resupplied and maneuvered to numerous points {{on the field of}} battle. Firebases could also be [...] "leapfrogged" [...] or shifted in response to an advance or operational needs.|$|E
