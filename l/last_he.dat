5|$|Petero Okotai participated on the Cook Islands' behalf in the men's 100meters breaststroke. He was {{the only}} Cook Islander {{participating}} in the event, or in any swimming event in general in Beijing. Okotai was 27 {{years old at the}} time of his participation at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and had not previously participated in any Olympic games. During the preliminary rounds, which took place on 9 August, the Cook Islander participated in the first heat, which included three people. Of those three, Okotai ranked third after finishing the event in 1:20.20. Oman's Mohammed Al-Habsi ranked ahead of Okotai (1:12.28), while Qatar's Osama Mohammed Ye Alarag took first in the heat (1:10.83). Of the 63 athletes who finished the qualification heats, Okotai ranked <b>last.</b> <b>He</b> did not advance to later rounds.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willson {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. From 1910 to 1919, he served on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. In 1914, he was {{a candidate for the}} Senate seat of Johnson Camden. It was the state's first senatorial election since passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, meaning the seat would be filled by popular vote rather than by a vote of the legislature. The seat had originally belonged to former governor Bradley, who had died in office. Governor McCreary appointed Camden to fill the unexpired term, but Camden had agreed not to seek re-election so that J. C. W. Beckham could run for the seat. In the Republican primary, Willson defeated Richard P. Ernst. In the general election, the unpopularity of Willson's gubernatorial administration combined with the overwhelming popularity of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, ensured that Beckham won the seat by more than 32,000 votes. This campaign was Willson's <b>last.</b> <b>He</b> died on August 24, 1931, and is buried in the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would <b>last.</b> <b>He</b> argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{considered}} {{returning to}} Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought {{a home and}} opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him {{to serve on the}} Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his Recollections, a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The <b>last</b> <b>he</b> delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.|$|E
