The patient had no associated comorbidities or allergies, and she was not under any medication. On physical examination, she presented one erythematous, exudative plaque, with dimensions of 2. 5 / 4 cm, located on the proximal phalanx and interphalangeal articulation of the left thumb. All histopathological  features were consistent with the diagnosis of <b>lichen</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>chronicus.</b> Some lesions of <b>lichen</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>chronicus</b> exhibit signs of pseudocarcinomatous, infundibular and sometimes eccrine ductal proliferation of keratinocytes.

On the other hand, long lasting lesions of <b>lichen</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>chronicus</b> may lead to alterations in the processes of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and eventually give rise to malignant transformation.

40|$|Certain skin disorders, such as contact {{dermatitis}} and chronic urticaria, {{are characterized by}} inflammation in-volving mast cells and worsen by stress. The underlying mechanism of this effect, however, is not known. The skin appears to have {{the equivalent of a}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, including local expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptors (CRH-R). We have reported that acute stress and intra-dermal administration of CRH stimulate skin mast cells and increase vascular permeability through CRH-R 1 ac-tivation. In this study, we investigated the expression of CRH-R 1, the main CRH-R subtype in human skin, and the mast cell related gene histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which regulates the production of histamine, in normal and pathological skin biopsies. Quantitative real time PCR revealed that chronic urticaria expresses high levels of CRH-R 1 and HDC as compared to normal foreskin, breast skin and cultured human keratinocytes. The <b>lichen</b> <b>simplex</b> samples had high expression of CRH-R 1, but low HDC. These results implicate CRH-R in chronic urticaria, which is often exacerbated by stress.

It must be distinguished from erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, cutaneous extension of breast carcinoma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, chronic eczema, lactiferous ducts ectasia, Bowen's disease, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and intraductal papilloma.

Proliferation and apoptotic indices were also assessed by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear anti-gen and TUNEL, respectively. We found the highest rate of prolifera-tion in verrucae and psoriasis followed by actinic keratosis, squamous and basal cell carcinoma, <b>lichen</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>chronicus,</b> and seborrheic keratosis; all were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than normal skin.
