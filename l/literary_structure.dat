25|$|The {{story may}} be divided to two parts similar in length, {{matching}} the trial's sequence. In {{the first part}} (verses 16–22) the case is described: The two women introduce their arguments, and at this point, no response from the king is recorded. In the second part (23–28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker {{and the one who}} directs the plot. Apart from this clear twofold division, suggestions have been raised as to the plot structure and the <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> of the story and its internal relations.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} assume, as mentioned, {{that the}} story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom - The concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary - but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king {{to break through the}} legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: Bathsheba, the woman of Tekoa, and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry. Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman. He proposes an analysis of the <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.|$|E

Paul Hunter, in his 1975 {{comparison}} of Fielding's theatrical style and form, notes that while [...] "many {{of the literary}} and theatrical jibes are witty," [...] the slow pacing and lack of dramatic conflict make the play seem [...] "essentially untheatrical". Pat Rogers disagrees, reasoning that [...] "Few livelier theatrical occasions can ever have been seen than the original runs of The Author's Farce, with their mixture of broad comedy, personal satire, tuneful scenes and rapid action." [...] Robert Hume, in 1988, comments that the <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> of The Author's Farce is [...] "ramshackle but effective", although he considers that [...] "Fielding's parody of recognition scenes is done with verve" [...] and [...] "the 'realistic' {{part of the show}} is a clever combination of the straightforward and the ironic." [...] Writing in 1998, Thomas Lockwood explains various aspects that make the play great, putting particular emphasis on the [...] "musical third act", which he believes [...] "shows a gift for brilliant theatrical arrangement". Lockwood praises the play's conclusion in particular, and the ever-increasing tempo of events following Murdertext's [...] "explosive invasion".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has also}} been argued {{that there is a}} [...] "pre-Maccabean core" [...] to the prophetic revelation {{delivered}} by Gabriel in verses 24-27, and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting oracle that was already in circulation at the time of composition. These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different redactional layers represented in this text reflect different eschatological perspectives, with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of [...] "a prophetic manifesto for world domination." [...] It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of <b>literary</b> <b>structure</b> at an earlier stage of its development {{in such a way that}} the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were chiastically linked to six divisions of verses 25-27 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum: ...|$|E

If the {{technical}} faults of the poem, which critics are at much pains to point out, are not discovered by the student, his knowledge will be quite as profitable. Additional reading in Lowell's works should be secured, and can be through the sympathetic interest and enthusiasm of the instructor. The following selections may be used for rapid examination and discussion: Under the Willows, The First Snow-Fall, Under the Old Elm, Auf Wiedersehen, Sunthin' in the Pastoral Line, Jonathan to John, Mr. Hosea Biglow to the Editor of the Atlantic Monthly, and the prose essays My Garden Acquaintance and A Good Word for Winter. The opportunity should not be lost for making the students forever and interestedly acquainted with Lowell, with the poet and the man.|$|E
60|$|On {{through for}} months and years to '73 I saw and talk'd with O'C. almost daily. I had soon got employment, first {{for a short time}} in the Indian Bureau (in the Interior Department,) and then for a long while in the Attorney General's Office. The secession war, with its tide of varying fortunes, excitements--President Lincoln and the daily sight of him--the doings in Congress and at the State Capitols--the news from the fields and campaigns, and from foreign governments--my visits to the Army Hospitals, daily and nightly, soon {{absorbing}} everything else,--with a hundred matters, occurrences, personalties,--(Greeley, Wendell Phillips, the parties, the Abolitionists, &c.)--were the subjects of our talk and discussion. I am not sure from what I heard then, but O'C. was cut out for a first-class public speaker or forensic advocate. No audience or jury could have stood out against him. He had a strange charm of physiologic voice. He had a power and sharp-cut faculty of statement and persuasiveness beyond any man's else. I know it well, for I have felt it many a time. If not as orator, his forte was as critic, newer, deeper than any: also, as literary author. One of his traits was that while he knew all, and welcom'd all sorts of great genre literature, all lands and times, from all writers and artists, and not only tolerated each, and defended every attack'd literary person with a skill or heart-catholicism that I never saw equal'd--invariably advocated and excused them--he kept an idiosyncrasy and identity of his own very mark'd, and without special tinge or undue color from any source. He always applauded the freedom of the masters, whence and whoever. I remember his special defences of Byron, Burns, Poe, Rabelais, Victor Hugo, George Sand, and others. There was always a little touch of pensive cadence in his superb voice; and I think there was something of the same sadness in his temperament and nature. Perhaps, too, in his <b>literary</b> <b>structure.</b> But he was a very buoyant, jovial, good-natured companion.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether or}} not an overall unity can be {{detected}} in Midrash Tehillim. The present dissertation will {{argue that there is}} a unity and coherence in Midrash Tehiliim that transcends its discrete pericopes, however these are defined. This coherence takes place in a number of ways. Midrash Tehillim is a lemmatic commentary on the book of Psalms and it follows the sequence, topics and argument of the Psalms. The unity of Midrash Tehillim is also evident at a linguistic level. It is in Rabbinic Hebrew, with some intermingling of Jewish Aramaic. On a third level unity is found in the exegetical techniques of Midrash Tehillim. Also the limited repertory of themes, namely the figure of David, the Temple, including its destruction, and redemption provide unity. It is redemption that is the most characteristic theme of Midrash Tehillim. Finally Midrash Tehillim is unified by the use of a number of <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> which permeate the work. Two <b>literary</b> <b>structures</b> stand out, namely the Petichah and the Mashal. These Meshalim are particularly artfully composed and a number of them are thematically linked to the redemption. The analysis of the Meshalim of Redemption in Midrash Tehillim has been contextualized {{in a variety of ways}} - in terms of previous scholarly work on Midrash, in terms of the state of the text as found in the manuscripts and in terms of the relationship of Midrash Tehillim to other Midrashim.
