40|$|Eustrongylides spp. is {{considered}} a freshwater fish zoonotic nematode. In the present study, the prevalence of Eustrongylides spp. in six edible fish (European perch - Perca fluviatilis, goldfish - Carassius auratus, <b>largemouth</b> black <b>bass</b> - Micropterus salmoides, tench- Tinca tinca, carp - Cyprinus carpio and sand smelt - Atherina boyeri) of Trasimeno lake was surveyed. The investigations were conducted from October 2014 to September 2015 and 384 specimens per species for each season were caught in Trasimeno lake and examined {{for the presence of}} larvae in the abdominal cavity and muscle. The presence of nematodes in the abdominal cavity and musculature was revealed in three fish species. The prevalence of Eustrongylides spp. infection was 6. 84, 1. 89 and 0. 13 % in perch, <b>largemouth</b> black <b>bass</b> and sand smelt, respectively. The number of parasites per fish was only one in <b>largemouth</b> black <b>bass</b> and sand smelt and ranged from one up to three in perch. This study states that the European perch, <b>largemouth</b> black <b>bass</b> and sand smelt of Trasimeno lake are infected with zoonotic parasites; therefore, food business operators have to take appropriate measures to guarantee the health of consumers...|$|R
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E

Catch and release fishing of smallmouth bass and <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> is permitted on the creek.|$|E
5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass.</b> Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E

5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass.</b> The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> and chain pickerel.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.|$|E
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass</b> and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E

5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, <b>largemouth</b> <b>bass,</b> pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
