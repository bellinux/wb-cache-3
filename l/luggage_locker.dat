2500|$|The M62 coach bombing {{occurred}} on 4 February 1974 on the M62 motorway in northern England, when a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded in a coach carrying off-duty British Armed Forces personnel {{and their family}} members. Twelve people (nine soldiers, three civilians) {{were killed by the}} bomb, which consisted of [...] of high explosive hidden in a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> on the coach. Later in 1974 Judith Ward was convicted of the crime, but 18 years later the conviction was judged as wrongful and she was released from prison.|$|E
2500|$|The Mouse was a low-wing {{monoplane}} touring aircraft, {{powered by}} a 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. Construction was mainly of fabric-covered spruce wood frames, with some plywood-covered sections. It had folding wings, retractable main landing gear and fixed tailskid. Accommodation was for the pilot and two passengers, accessible via a sliding framed canopy, plus an additional <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b> The first flight of the Mouse was at Heston aerodrome on 11 September 1933, piloted by Nick Comper. In February 1934, it was assessed at A Martlesham Heath, leading to various small design changes ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2003 memoir The Bright Shapes and the True Names, Patrick McCaughey {{wrote that}} {{a few days before}} the {{painting}} was recovered, a Melbourne art dealer called him to say that a young artist may know something about the theft. [...] When he visited the artist's studio, McCaughey writes, he made a point to say that he was interested in the return of the painting, not a conviction for the crime: [...] "I said deliberately, at least twice, that the people who had taken the work could deposit it in a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at Spencer Street railway station or at Tullamarine Airport." ...|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{facilities}} available include: exchange office, {{lost property}} office, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> baby changing area, health centre and various shops. A business centre is available too. There are 1,500 parking spaces for {{long and short}} term parking.|$|R
50|$|Amongst the {{facilities}} {{of the station}} are a police station, cash machines, cafés, bars, food stands, a bakery, a supermarket (Aperto), newsagents, a media shop (CityDisc), a cybercafe, kiosks, underground car park, an underground shopping arcade, toilets and showers, and <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coin-operated public <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> can {{be present}} in bus {{stations}} and rail stations. In some countries they were commonplace from the 1950s to the 1970s, but eliminated for concern that bombs may be hidden in them. Some airports have also removed them for this reason.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{absence of}} a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back did not {{necessarily}} enforce a complete absence of luggage.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{windows in}} the rear-hinged doors slid open horizontally. The <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> had to be {{accessed}} from inside.|$|E
5000|$|The Lloyd Alexander was {{identical}} to the Lloyd 600 in most respects, but {{in place of the}} three speed transmission of the 600, the Alexander featured a four-speed gear-box (and a higher final drive ratio). The Alexander was offered, in parallel with the 600, between 1957 and 1961. [...] One difference visible from the outside was that the Alexander included an opening hatch into the rear <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> whereas drivers of the 600 had to reach behind the rear seat in order to access the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} on a raised viaduct {{running in a}} roughly north-south direction. There are two exits, the north exit (北口) and south exit (南口). Both exits have ticket vending {{machines}} and toilets; however, the north exit has a Midori no Madoguchi staffed ticket office and escalators to the platforms. <b>Luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> {{are available at the}} south exit.|$|R
5000|$|The L-1049H flew on November 20, 1956. Called [...] "Super H" [...] and [...] "Husky", the L-1049H was a {{convertible}} passenger/freight aircraft, mating a C-121C-based fuselage with L-1049G components. The cargo hold had {{a volume of}} 565 ft³ (16 m³) when including the lower hold. The aircraft could carry up to 120 people with seats, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and toilets all available along with the option of decorating {{the walls of the}} aircraft. When not in use, the <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and seats could be stowed in the lower hold. The aircraft entered service with QANTAS a month later. Some L-1049G and H aircraft in later production were fitted with the TC-18EA series engines used on the L-1649 Starliner. A final variant was planned in 1957, known as the L-1049J. Powered by four R-3350-988-TC-18EA-6 engines, the L-1049J was based on the L-1049H with the wings of the R7V-2 Constellation and an extra fuselage-mounted fuel tank.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{building}} today hosts {{a passport}} control and customs office, which are open when trains to/from Russia depart/arrive. The waiting hall is open during daytime, {{but has no}} facilities, such as <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> WC nor a ticket office (the nearby bus station has a toilet but no left luggage service). Access to platforms is only possible in conjunction with train departures and arrivals.|$|R
50|$|Offered with wider {{let-down}} cockpit {{doors and}} an enlarged <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> behind the rear cockpit. The luxury version also featured a state-of-the-art 1930's style two-color paint scheme for the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|In the Osthalle {{there is}} a service point for the InterCity courier service (IC-Kurierdienst) and a <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> room with 766 lockers. On the station {{forecourt}} {{there is a}} taxicab stand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} was considered [...] "surprisingly" [...] spacious for {{this class of}} car, with plenty of space for four, although the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> under the front hood/bonnet offered only limited space: unlike the similarly configured competitor Renault Dauphine and Renault 8 (and Simca's own prototypes for the Simca 1000) which stowed their spare wheels flat underneath the front <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> the Simca 1000 had its spare wheel stowed vertically in the front luggage compartment, just behind the front bumper. The driver enjoyed an excellent view out: the speedometer pod and minor controls positioned ahead of the driver were basic, although the manufacturer stressed that the glass covering the speedometer was angled to minimize reflections.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 a {{combination}} lock {{which could be}} set by the user to a sequence of his own choosing was invented by Andrew Elliot Rae. At this time the electronic keypad was invented and {{he was unable to}} get any manufacturers to back his mechanical lock for <b>lockers,</b> <b>luggage,</b> or brief-cases. The silicon chip locks never became popular due to the need for battery power to maintain their integrity. The patent expired and the original mechanical invention was instantly manufactured and sold worldwide mainly for <b>luggage,</b> <b>lockers,</b> and hotel safes. It is now a standard part of the luggage used by travellers.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} of the station leads directly to the station lobby. In the southwestern part of the lobby, there are a FotoFix automat and two pay phones; in the southern half (with its own access) are <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> ticket machines, the toilet and the DB travel centre. In the north-west wing is a candy kiosk and in the eastern half an ATM, a bakery / café and a newsagent.|$|R
2500|$|The station {{building}} {{features a}} heated waiting room, a café and kiosk, {{as well as}} <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> washrooms and ticket vending machines. It also hosts a staff canteen. Ticket sale is offered at the Narvesen kiosk. There is parking for 222 cars about [...] from the station. A bus station and taxi stand are located south of the station, while there is bicycle parking to the north. The station is located [...] from the Norwegian Railway Museum.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{engine bay}} had {{originally}} been designed to take the four-stroke air-cooled two-cylinder engine from the NSU Prinz. The rotary unit was much more compact which permitted a shallow <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> to be placed above it. This compensated for reduction in luggage space {{at the front of}} the car due to the installation there of the radiator.|$|E
50|$|The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat {{monoplane}} which {{retained the}} fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage {{of the earlier}} Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large <b>luggage</b> <b>locker,</b> the top decking at the rear could be removed to carry a spare propeller or skis.|$|E
50|$|In October 1965, detectives who had arrested Ian Brady for {{the murder}} of 17-year-old Edward Evans in Hattersley {{discovered}} evidence in a left <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the station which connected them to the disappearances of two missing children, who were soon discovered to have been murdered by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley in the widely reported Moors murders, in which at least five children and teenagers were murdered.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} hall has {{underfloor heating}} from a groundwater heat pump. Wind towers and louvres draw {{air into the}} hall and air curtains prevent fumes getting in. Each bus route has an area within the interchange, buses being automatically directed to a stop in that area. Doors to the hall open once the bus stops and another door at the front allows cyclists to access bus bike racks. Although pedestrians aren't permitted in the bus manoeuvering area, bus speeds are restricted. Cycle racks for 100 bicycles are on two levels and there are e-bike chargers. There are also toilets, <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> and an information counter. Tactile paving guides sight impaired passengers. A large canopy and verandas provide shelter outside.|$|R
2500|$|By 1964, she {{was calling}} her artistic {{expressions}} of the proverbial everywoman Nanas, after a French slang word that is roughly equivalent to [...] "broad", or [...] "chick". The first of these freely-posed forms—made of papier-mâché, yarn, and cloth—were exhibited at the Alexander Iolas Gallery in Paris in September 1965. For this show, Iolas published Saint Phalle's first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of Bananas. During this show, she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the Artist's Club of New York, whereby artworks were randomly left in coin-operated <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers</b> at Pennsylvania Station, and keys were offered for $10 each. Encouraged by Iolas, she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silk-screened prints, posters, books, and writings.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} renovated {{in three stages}} for Expo 2000 in Hanover in the late 1990s. First began the {{extension}} of the subway tunnel {{in the area of the}} old platforms A and B (tracks 4/5 and 6/7) and the provision of additional space for retail in this tunnel. The old platforms were also redeveloped, with the focus on the entrance area with a partially glazed roof. The newly built platform lifts were boarded up for months due to the lack of a Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approval. In the third phase of the rebuilding, the part of the station building next to the tracks were rebuilt with toilets and <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers.</b> Simultaneously, the three through tracks between the station building and platform A were reduced to one track.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} {{at the end of}} April 1955, and it was noted that the existing Continental model would continue. The new standard steel saloon replaced the R type standard steel saloon which had been in production, with modifications, since 1946. It was a more generously sized five- or six-seater saloon with the body manufactured in pressed steel with stressed skin construction. Doors, bonnet and <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> lid were of aluminium.|$|E
50|$|The Lloyd 600/Alexander body offered {{accommodation}} in {{the passenger}} cabin for four adults, but access to the rear seat was difficult and space cramped, with {{the width of the}} back seat reduced by the space taken up by the rear wheel arches. There was more space at the front, although there were criticisms that the steering wheel was too close to the driver. The <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back had a total computed capacity of 104 litres.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{launched}} with a 6-cylinder in-line Sleeve valve engine of 2,344 cc, {{placing it in}} the 13CV car tax band. The factory bodied [...] "CS Type X68" [...] four door sedan/saloon/berline offered seating for 4/5 people and had a separate <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back. There were also various coupé and Cabriolet bodied cars produced. By 1932, when the [...] "Type X68" [...] {{gave way to the}} [...] "Type X72", 1,028 of the former had been produced.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} built in 1855 - 1857, as the {{starting}} point of the Oberschlesische Eisenbahn (Upper Silesian Railway), as well as the line from Breslau to Glogau via Posen. It replaced the earlier complex of the Oberschlesischer Bahnhof (Upper Silesian Railway Station, built 1841-1842). Its designer was the royal Prussian architect Wilhelm Grapow, and in the mid-19th century, it was located near the southern outskirts of the city, as the areas to the south had not yet been urbanized.The original concourse was located where the passenger hall now is, and was adjacent to the station yard. When construction finished in the mid-19th century, the station only had one platform, but the platform hall was some 200 metres long, and it was {{regarded as one of the}} biggest structures of this kind in Europe. By the entrances were <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> telephone and telegraph facilities. In the station complex was a restaurant and three waiting rooms (1st, 2nd, and 3rd class). There was also a special room and a separate hallway for VIPs.|$|R

50|$|The {{doors were}} hinged {{on the rear}} edge which {{facilitated}} access and egress. The windows in the doors slid open horizontally which avoided the need for costly and bulky winder mechanisms in the doors of what was, even {{by the standards of}} the time, a narrow car. The hood/bonnet lid was considered very narrow, and was broadened at the end of 1951. There was no opening hatch for the <b>luggage</b> <b>locker</b> at the back of the car, which instead had to be accessed by reaching behind the back seat.|$|E

50|$|The {{station is}} {{situated}} on the Dovre Line, 126.26 km from Oslo Central Station and 426.6 km from Trondheim Central Station, at an elevation of 127 m. Hamar Station is also the southern terminus of the Røros Line. The station has 3 tracks. Track 1 is served by a 414 m long side platform which is 62 cm tall, normally used by southbound trains. Track 2 and 3 share a 365 m long and 52 cm tall island platform. Track 2 normally serves trains on the Røros Line, while track 3 serves northbound trains on the Dovre Line. Tracks 2 and 3 are accessible from an underpass from the station building and an overpass {{to the south of}} the station.The station building features a heated waiting room, a café and kiosk, as well as <b>luggage</b> <b>lockers,</b> washrooms and ticket vending machines. It also hosts a staff canteen. Ticket sale is offered at the Narvesen kiosk. There is parking for 222 cars about 300 m from the station. A bus station and taxi stand are located south of the station, while there is bicycle parking to the north. The station is located 2 km from the Norwegian Railway Museum.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Access control== The seal gives users the {{opportunity}} to provide access control to objects such as warehouses, vehicles, containers, gas stations, offices, vault cash in banks, cash collection bags, slot machines, <b>lockers,</b> <b>luggage</b> and many other objects. Also food (fish, meat, honey) and fur animals can be protected from forgery.|$|R
25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side <b>lockers</b> <b>luggage</b> could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|R
