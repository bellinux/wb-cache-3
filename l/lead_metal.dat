5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>metal</b> resists sulfuric and {{phosphoric acid}} but not {{hydrochloric}} or nitric acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation {{of the product}} salt.

5|$|Most lead ores {{contain a}} low {{percentage}} of lead (rich ores have a typical content of 3–8%) {{which must be}} concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium separation, grinding, froth flotation, and drying. The resulting concentrate, which has a lead content of 30–80% by mass (regularly 50–60%), is then turned into (impure) <b>lead</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the use of a digital {{thruster}} (DT) for the separation of cadmium and <b>lead</b> <b>metals</b> from mixture samples. Mixtures of lead and cadmium salts with varying concentrations were injected into a free electrolytic diffusion apparatus (FEDA). The microcathodes surrounding the central anode were programmed witha DT. The DT distributed the charge over the microcathodes at time intervals of 100 - 900 mu s or at the frequency of 625 - 70 Hz. The microcathodes become electrodeposited with <b>lead</b> and cadmium <b>metals,</b> showing both separation and co-deposition. The purity of deposited metals was analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) using PerkinElmer and Aldrich AAS standards. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting <b>lead</b> <b>metal.</b> Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The <b>lead</b> <b>metal</b> would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the litharge. In the medieval period <b>lead</b> <b>metal</b> could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E
500|$|Franklin further {{explains}} in these letters that the jar did not electrically balance itself, but a wire of some conducting material {{had to make}} contact from the inner conductor (plus) to the outer conductor (minus). This way Franklin observed the balancing and combining of the two different states of electricity in the [...] "miraculous bottle." [...] In the later editions of the book Franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of Leyden jars that he termed [...] "electrical battery" [...] following the military term {{of the time of}} a [...] "battery" [...] being a group of cannons assembled together. Franklin assembled a number of parallel-plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were [...] "armed" [...] with a <b>lead</b> <b>metal</b> sheet on each side. He hooked them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge (balance) the battery when touched to both sides.|$|E

The composition of lead came changed over time, at first by removing other metals to make a [...] "pure lead" [...] and then again during war years when lead was needed for ammunition. Since the 1970s a new form of lead, restoration lead, was developed based upon medieval <b>lead's</b> <b>metal</b> composition. Restoration <b>lead</b> is stronger than lead came of the prior 100 years or so.|$|R

40|$|Metal {{films have}} been used {{extensively}} in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) devices.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Graphene is {{believed}} to be an excellent candidate material for next-generation electronic devices.

We have performed transport calculations for graphene junctions with wetting <b>metal</b> <b>leads</b> (<b>metal</b> <b>leads</b> that bind covalently to graphene) using nonequilibrium Green’s functions and density functional theory. Quantitative information is provided on the increased resistance with respect to ideal contacts and on the statistics of current fluctuations. We find that charge transport through the studied two-terminal graphene junction with Ti contacts is pseudo-diffusive up to surprisingly high energies...|$|R
