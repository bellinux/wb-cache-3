500|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{is essential to}} many applications of Euclid's algorithm, such as demonstrating the unique factorization of numbers into prime factors. To illustrate this, suppose that a number L can be written {{as a product of}} two factors u and v, that is, L=uv. If another number w also divides <b>L</b> <b>but</b> is coprime with u, then w must divide v, by the following argument: If the greatest common divisor of u and w is 1, then integers s and t can be found such that ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first point}} follows from basic {{properties}} of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in <b>L,</b> <b>but</b> not both since L and R {{are supposed to be}} disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1="0", p2="1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow [...] "9" [...] in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of [...] "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.|$|E

2500|$|Around 200 AD, ten of {{the plays}} of Euripides began to be {{circulated}} in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophoclesthe only plays of theirs that survive today. Euripides however was more fortunate than the other tragedians in the survival of a second edition of his work, compiled in alphabetical order {{as if from a}} set of his collect works, but without scholia attached. This [...] "Alphabetical" [...] edition was combined with the [...] "Select" [...] edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The [...] "Select" [...] plays are found in many medieval manuscripts but only two manuscripts preserve the [...] "Alphabetical" [...] playsoften denoted L and P, after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of <b>L,</b> <b>but</b> the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing The Trojan Women and latter part of The Bacchae.|$|E
2500|$|The {{single-track}} line, {{built to}} carry goods, mainly coal and raw cotton to the cotton mills in Bolton from the Port of Liverpool via the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, was [...] long. The first section opened on 1 August 1828 between Derby Street Bolton and William Hulton's collieries at Pendlebury Fold near Chequerbent in Westhoughton. Fletchers sidings near Bag Lane provided a connection for Fletcher's collieries at Howe Bridge in Atherton. The railway opened {{two years before}} the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L). The route was surveyed and prepared by George Stephenson, but engineered by Robert Daglish, a local man who built a locomotive for the Orrell Colliery Railway. The railway was single track with two rope worked inclines using stationary steam engines, one generating 20 horse power at Daubhill and a 50 horse power engine at Chequerbent. The first locomotive, Lancashire Witch was built by George and Robert Stephenson. It was originally intended for the <b>L</b> <b>but</b> was delivered temporarily to the B as it opened first, and later moved to the L for use in its construction. While with B it was used to haul trains up the 1 in 33 gradient at Daubhill. After the Rainhill Trials it was replaced by Timothy Hackworth's Sans Pareil. [...] The line was completed to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh by end of March 1830.|$|E

6000|$|There was one fatal Englishman whom I {{shared with}} {{him during the}} great part of a season: a poor soul, not without gifts, but always ready for more, {{especially}} if they {{took the form of}} meat and drink. He had brought letters from one of the best English men alive, who withdrew them too late to save his American friends from the sad consequences of welcoming him. So he established himself impregnably in a Boston club, and came out every day to dine with Longfellow in Cambridge, beginning with his return from Nahant in October and continuing far into December. That was the year of the great horse-distemper, when the plague disabled the transportation in Boston, and cut off all intercourse between the suburb and the city on the street railways. [...] "I did think," [...] Longfellow pathetically lamented, [...] "that when the horse-cars stopped running, I should have a little respite from <b>L.,</b> <b>but</b> he walks out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nothing then remained, dear <b>L.,</b> <b>but</b> payer d'audace, and, {{throwing}} all forethought to the dogs, to {{rely upon}} what has made many a small man great, the good star. I addressed my companions in a set speech, advising a mount without delay. They suggested {{a letter to the}} Amir, requesting permission to enter his city: this device was rejected for two reasons. In the first place, had a refusal been returned, our journey was cut short, and our labours stultified. Secondly, the End of Time had whispered that my two companions were plotting to prevent the letter reaching its destination. He had charged his own sin upon their shoulders: the Hammal and Long Guled were incapable of such treachery. But our hedge-priest was thoroughly terrified; [...] "a coward body after a'," [...] his face brightened when ordered to remain with the Gerad at Sagharrah, and though openly taunted with poltroonery, he had not the decency to object. My companions were then informed that hitherto our acts had been those of old women, not soldiers, and that something savouring of manliness must be done before we could return. They saw my determination to start alone, if necessary, and to do them justice, they at once arose. This was the more courageous in them, as alarmists had done their worst: but a day before, some travelling Somali had advised them, as they valued dear life, not to accompany that Turk to Harar. Once in the saddle, they shook off sad thoughts, declaring that if they were slain, I should pay their blood-money, and if they escaped, that their reward was in my hands. When in some danger, the Hammal especially behaved with a sturdiness which produced the most beneficial results. Yet they were true Easterns. Wearied by delay at Harar, I employed myself in meditating flight; they drily declared that after-wit serves no good purpose: whilst I considered the possibility of escape, they looked only at the prospect of being dragged back with pinioned arms by the Amir's guard. Such is generally the effect of the vulgar Moslems' blind fatalism.|$|E
