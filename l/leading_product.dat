Trading as Dolphin Enterprises, it sold the original front-entry Dolphin suits in ready-made and kit forms, before launching a new design 2-ply pocket entry suit.

500|$|Of {{the many}} Old World plants that the Spanish {{introduced}} to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted. Apples {{were introduced to}} North America by colonists in the 17th century, and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625. The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called [...] "common apples". Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, {{as well as being}} cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the [...] "best" [...] cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century. In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the <b>leading</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out.

2500|$|Brazil's {{early years}} as an {{independent}} nation were extremely difficult. 1820-1872 for Brazil {{was a combination of}} stagnation and regional diversity. According to Leff (1982, 1997), from the time of Brazil’s independence in 1822, its rate of GDP growth failed to outpace its population growth. Hence, while the population did expand at a rapid pace (nearly 2 per cent per annum), the country’s efforts to improve its performance in per capita terms were largely frustrating until the start of the twentieth century. This protracted and very difficult period of stagnation was, however, the net results of widely varying trends in different regions of the country. The north-eastern part of Brazil, which was a platform for sugar and cotton exports and which accounted for 57 per cent of the country’s exports at the start of this period, saw a steady decline in its external sales. In 1866-70, these crops represented just 30 per cent of exports, while the share of coffee exports-the <b>leading</b> <b>product</b> in the south-eastern portion of the country-jumped from 26 to 47 per cent.|$|E
