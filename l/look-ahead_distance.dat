We have reformulated the problem as an optimal control problem, using a trajectory generator that can meet arbitrary boundary state constraints.

40|$|Simple and {{efficient}} geometric controllers, like Pure-Pursuit, {{have been widely}} used in various types of autonomous vehicles to solve tracking problems. In this paper, we have developed a new pursuit method, named CF-Pursuit, which has been based on Pure-Pursuit but with certain differences. In CF-Pursuit, in order to reduce fitting errors, we used a clothoid C 1 curve to replace the circle employed in Pure-Pursuit. This improvement to the fitting method helps the Pursuit method to decrease tracking errors. As regards the selection of <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance,</b> we employed a fuzzy system to directly consider the path's curvature. There are three input variables in this fuzzy system, 6 mcurvature, 9 mcurvature and 12 mcurvature, calculated from the clothoid fit with the current position and the goal position on the defined path. A Sugeno fuzzy model was adapted to output a reasonable <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> using the experiences of human drivers as well as our own tests.

40|$|This report {{presents}} two optimization problems, {{where three}} cost-functions are suggested for each. The {{goal for the}} first optimization problem {{is to find a}} time variant <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> which improves the performance of the vessel in terms of the cross-track error, relative to constant look-ahead distances. The second optimization problem is an extension of the first, where a time variant surge velocity reference is also calculated. This results in smaller cross-track errors, at the cost of increased calculation time. It is assumed that the path and the desired surge velocity on the path is supplied by some external source. Existing kappa-exponential control laws are used to track the references resulting from the calculated optimal <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> and surge velocity reference. The predictions needed to solve the optimization problem are made from a model where the control laws are inserted into the dynamics to simplify the model. The optimization problems are solved for two different approaches. The first approach uses an LTV model for predictions and a QP-solver to solve the optimization problem. The second approach forms predictions of the states by numerical integration of the system dynamics and uses an optimization problem solver for general non-linear functions to solve the optimization problem. The latter approach generally results in longer calculation times but better accuracy, while the first approach yields convexity of the optimization problem. A passive observer is used to estimate the current such that it can be included in the predictions. Four of the six suggested cost-functions lead to significantly improved performance of the vessel in terms of the cross-track error. This is true both in the case of no disturbances and {{in the presence of a}} constant irrotational current. That is, the position of the vessel converges faster to the path, the vessel stays closer to the path and has less over-shoot in the cross-track error, for the optimal inputs than for constant inputs. The cost-functions includes weights for tuning where the tuning process is easy for some of the cost-functions. One of the cost-functions where only the optimal <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> is calculated, results in calculation times shorter than the time between samples, after a few time steps. This is a promising result since the application of MPC to fast-dynamic systems such as marine vessels is desired, but often problematic due to too long calculation times for solving the optimization problem. It takes more time to solve the optimization problem when the optimal surge velocity reference is found in addition to the optimal <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Four {{methods of}} {{detection}} of {{bodies of water}} are under development as means to enable autonomous robotic ground vehicles to avoid water hazards when traversing off-road terrain. The methods involve processing of digitized outputs of optoelectronic sensors aboard the vehicles. It is planned to implement these methods in hardware and software that would operate {{in conjunction with the}} hardware and software for navigation and for avoidance of solid terrain obstacles and hazards. The first method, intended for use during the day, is based on the observation that, under most off-road conditions, reflections of sky from water are easily discriminated from the adjacent terrain by their color and brightness, regardless of the weather and of the state of surface waves on the water. Accordingly, this method involves collection of color imagery by a video camera and processing of the image data by an algorithm that classifies each pixel as soil, water, or vegetation according to its color and brightness values (see figure). Among the issues that arise is {{the fact that in the}} presence of reflections of objects on the opposite shore, it is difficult to distinguish water by color and brightness alone. Another issue is that once a body of water has been identified by means of color and brightness, its boundary must be mapped for use in navigation. Techniques for addressing these issues are under investigation. The second method, which is not limited by time of day, is based on the observation that ladar returns from bodies of water are usually too weak to be detected. In this method, ladar scans of the terrain are analyzed for returns and the absence thereof. In appropriate regions, the presence of water can be inferred from the absence of returns. Under some conditions in which reflections from the bottom are detectable, ladar returns could, in principle, be used to determine depth. The third method involves the recognition of bodies of water as dark areas in short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) images. This method is based on the fact, well known among experts in remote sensing, that water bodies of any appreciable depth appear very dark in near-infrared, overhead imagery. Even under a thick layer of marine fog, SWIR illumination is present. Hence, this method may work even in the presence of clouds, though it is unlikely to work at night. Snow and ice also exhibit very strong absorption at wavelengths greater than about 1. 4 m. Hence, the wavelength range of about 1. 5 to 1. 6 m might be useable in this method for recognizing water, snow, and ice. One notable drawback of this method is that useful <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> could be limited by surface reflections. The fourth method, intended for use at night, involves the contrast between water and terrain in thermal-infrared (medium-wavelength infrared) imagery. This method is based on the fact that at night, water is usually warmer than the adjacent terrain. <b>Look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> could be limited in this method because, for reasons not yet fully understood, water appears to darken in the thermal infrared with increasing distance...|$|E

The model of the UAV Aerosonde is used to develop a reconfigurable control system based on the control allocation technique {{for a variety of}} faults, such as locked-in-place control surfaces. It is shown through simulation that the developed technique is successful to recover the aircraft from various faults but cannot guarantee success on the planned mission. For mission scenarios where performance degradation is such that the prescribed trajectory cannot be achieved, a reconfigurable guidance system is developed, which is capable of adapting parameters such as the minimum turning radius and the <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> for obstacle avoidance, to allow the vehicle to dynamically generate a path which guides the aircraft around the no-fly zones taking into account the post-fault reduced performance.

40|$|Fundamental to {{the design}} of an Ackerman steered {{autonomous}} ground vehicle is the development of a low-level controller that effectively performs trajectory or path tracking. Though ample literature is available on various methods for controlling ground vehicles, little information is presented on the implementation and tuning of such controllers. Moreover, few sources extend ground vehicle control to driving in reverse. This work presents a novel approach to the implementation of the traditional "pure pursuit" style controller in which a dynamic vehicle model is used to map from the path curvature specified by the pure pursuit algorithm to the vehicle's actual steering angle. Additionally, an analytical methodology using a linear model of straight-line path following is used to tune the pure pursuit <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance.</b> This pure pursuit controller is then contrasted with a simulation-based controller that uses a kinematic model to predict the vehicle's response to a series of different steering inputs; a performance metric is used to select the best command given these predictions. Successful trajectory control results are presented at speeds up to 22 mph. The second focus of this work is the control of a front-wheel steered vehicle driving in reverse. Novel to this work is the presentation of pure pursuit as a stable solution to this problem. Pure pursuit is then contrasted with the mechanism-based controller that was developed by Patwardhan et al. at the University of California Berkeley. In presenting this controller, a new method employing a linear kinematic vehicle model is used to tune the controller parameters. It is then shown that, under specific conditions, the mechanism-based controller and the pure pursuit controller are identical. Both controllers are then compared with the simulation-based controller adapted for driving in reverse. (cont.) Results are presented at speeds up to 6. 7 mph. Results for the implementation of these controllers were collected using a 2006 Land Rover LR 3 developed for MIT's entry into the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge.

Due to increased labor cost and uncertainty with labor availability in recent years, tree fruit {{industry in the}} Washington State can benefit from robotic solutions to combat with these problems. A “bin-dog” system is a robotic bin management system used in orchard. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop an automated bin-dog system of good maneuverability for effective fruit bin management in typical PNW tree fruit orchard environment. To fulfil this goal, a conceptual prototype of a bin-dog system was developed and tested. The proposed bin-dog system adopted an innovative “go-over-the-bin” concept, which allowed the conceptual system to manage bins in a five-step process. To obtain effective maneuverability on bin-dog, a coordinate control system for a four-wheel-independent-steering (4 WIS) system was developed to independently control the rotational speeds and steering angles of all its wheels. Field tests in a commercial orchard showed that the bin-dog system could follow the process to replace a full bin on an aisle with an empty bin. To provide guideline information for navigating bin-dog with the 4 WIS system, the influence of major factors on path tracking performance using four proposed steering modes were investigated through a series of field tests. The results indicated that longitudinal driving speed, <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance</b> and/or steering mode could be carefully selected for different paths and tasks to achieve a high path tracking accuracy and small spatial requirement. A steering strategy selection algorithm was developed to generate and determine an optimized steering strategy to complete designated operations including steering back to center line of an aisle, steering into an aisle from headland and bin loading on an aisle in orchard environment.

We also present the results of a series of experiments that were designed to provide a systematic comparison of a number of control strategies. The control strategies that were explored include a lead-lag control law, a full- state linear controller and input-output linearizing control law. Each of these control strategies was implemented and tested at highway speeds on our experimental vehicle platform, a Honda Accord LX sedan. For the longitudinal control problem, we investigated the possibility of using stereo vision to provide the range information, in conjunction with a scanning laser radar sensor. The vision based tracking system utilizes a layered architecture wherein the bottom layer computes motion in both images using a simple correlation algorithm, and the upper level performs stereo xation and reconstruction using an algorithm designed for active vision systems. We present some initial results comparing the quality of range measurements provided by a vision system with the laser radar system.

40|$|Testing a vehicle’s limit {{handling}} capabilities {{can provide}} a valuable insight into analysing and hence developing new vehicle designs. A driver model is a convenient tool used particularly in full vehicle simulations {{and if it is}} capable of simulating driving on the limit with minimum user input then it becomes all the more effective. There is inadequate information found in literature concerning the simulation of limit handling capability of a vehicle using a driver model. There was a requirement to improve an existing driver model in Modelon AB’s Vehicle dynamics library (VDL), so that it would enable the user find the limits of handling of a vehicle. This also had to be accomplished with minimum user input and without a priori information of the entire track. Furthermore, the vehicle model should be driven on the pre-defined path on the road accurately. Hence the speed calculation has to be accurate, capable of triggering braking, whenever required to successfully maintain the trajectory of the vehicle on the given path. The targets of lateral and longitudinal acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle model were the only input specified by the user. The complete driver model was then to be used in closed loop driving manoeuvre simulations on a 2 -D road. The velocity planning block, developed in this thesis, calculates the vehicle speed based on user inputs. It also utilises a limited look-ahead preview of the track and ensures that the vehicle model is pushed to the boundaries of these specified targets {{while at the same time}} maintaining the pre-defined trajectory.

The GUI gives easy access to analyse video, image and vehicle dynamics. Once the GUI application for simulation is launched, user can enter input parameters value (number of frames, canny edge detection value, vehicle speed, and braking time) in text control to simulate and analyse video images and vehicle driving control. In this study, there are four subsystems in the system development process. The first subsystem is sensor. This study was used a single GrandVision Mini Digital Video as sensor. This video camera provides the information of Selangor's highway environment by recording highway scene in front of the vehicle during driving. Then, the recorded video is process in second subsystem or named as imageprocessing subsystem. In this subsystem, image-capturing techniques capture the video images frame by frame. After that, lane detection process extracts the information about vehicle position with respect to the highway lane. The results are angle between the road tangent and orientation of the vehicle at some <b>look-ahead</b> <b>distance.</b> Driving controller in the controller subsystem that is the third subsystem used the resulted angle from lane detection process along with vehicle dynamics parameters to determine the vehicle-driving angle and vehicle dynamics performance. In this study, designing a vehicle controller requires a model of vehicle's behaviour whether dynamics or kinematics. Therefore, in vehicle subsystem that is the fourth subsystem, this study used vehicle's dynamics behaviour as the vehicle model. The model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and several factors such as the vehicle weight, centre of gravity, and cornering stiffness were taken into account of dynamics modelling. The important contribution of this study is the development of vehicle lane detection and tracking algorithm based on colour cue segmentation, Canny edge detection and Hough transform. The algorithm gave good result in detecting straight and smooth curvature lane on highway even when the lane was affected by shadow. In this study, all the methods have been tested on video data and the experimental results have demonstrated a fast and robust system...|$|E
