40|$|A Master's Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Science degree of the Loughborough University of Technology. Librarians have an increased need for information to help them improve the provision of document supply services to users. This increased need results from developments {{in the field of}} document supply, such as the emergence of CAS-IAS services. The study considers the value of using inter-library <b>loan</b> <b>statistics</b> and studies of particular groups' information needs to provide this information. Individual inter-library loan records are analysed to provide information on the need for document supply by Loughborough University's engineering community. A smaller sample records is analysed to determine how the current service offered by the Pilkington Library meets the need described. Inter-library <b>loan</b> <b>statistics,</b> generated by an automated inter-library loan management system, are used as a source of comparable information on the service received throughout Loughborough University. The study seems to indicate that engineers have greater need for conference proceedings and reports, {{than the rest of the}} academic community. Results also show that engineers of different academic grades and disciplines differ in their use of the document delivery service. The highest demand for the service came from research students, followed by staff. More of their demand was for conference proceedings, whereas books accounted for more of postgraduate and undergraduate requests. The departments of manufacturing, mechanical and chemical engineering exhibited the highest demand, and proportionally more of their requests were for serials. The departments of aeronautical and automotive engineering and transport studies and civil and building engineering requested proportionally more reports. The study also shows the use of bibliographic reference services to be dependent on the academic grade and discipline of the requester. The BIDS service was shown to be the most popular, being favoured by research students and staff and mechanical, manufacturing and chemical engineers. Undergraduates and the department of aeronautical and automotive and transport studies used various sources in significant amounts.

Using a generalized least squares variant of the methodology, this paper provides estimates of transition matrices for the United States using both nonperforming loan data and interest coverage data. The methodology can be employed to condition the matrices on economic fundamentals and provide separate transition matrices for expansions and contractions, for example. The transition matrices can also be used as an input into other credit-risk models that use transition matrices as a basic building block.

For this, we conducted an exploratory study based on loan data (1000 most borrowed monographs) from two non-Anglo-Saxon European university libraries (Granada and Vienna) with strong social sciences and humanities components. Loans to scientists only were also analysed at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, citation counts for the 100 most borrowed scientific monographs (SM) and textbooks or manuals (MTB) were retrieved from Web of Science and Google Scholar. The results show considerable similarities in both libraries: the percentage of loans for books in national languages represents almost 96 per cent of the total share and SM accounts only for 10 to 13 per cent. When considering loans to scientists only, the percentage of English books increases to 30 per cent, the percentage of SM loans also increases (approx 80 per cent). Furthermore, we found no significant correlations between loans and citations. Since <b>loan</b> <b>statistics</b> are currently insufficient for measuring the use of monographs, their suggested use as an applicable selection criterion for book citation indexes is not yet feasible.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyse the {{accessibility}} in and to a picture book. The book was {{selected on the basis of}} <b>loan</b> <b>statistics</b> in a multilingual school. At the third place in the statistics was the most lent student-selected picture book Alfons and Milla (Bergström, 1985) which is the focus of this study. The book was analysed as to its accessibility in three different ways: the accessibility to the relationships revealed in the illustrations of the book, the accessibility to the interaction between image and written text, and also the librarian’s influence regarding the physical accessibility of the book.   The study reveals that the relationships between the characters in the book were often implicitly expressed and therefore an advanced literate understanding is required to understand the relations between the characters and to get access to the whole story. The correspondence between texts and images were often weak as the texts did not explicitly describe what was really happening in the image but instead described other things. This means that to completely understand and get access to the interaction between text and image the reader must have developed a rather advanced literate competence. Regarding the physical access to the book, the librarian actually tried to minimize the physical accessibility to the book in favour of other books.   The conclusion of the study is that the reader must be able to make many interpretations to grip the implicit meanings in the book. Such interpretations require quite an advanced literate competence. The book is popular among the multilingual pupils which show that they find pleasure in the book in one way or another even though they might not understand all implicit relations. The didactic implication of the study is that the pupils might need explicit teaching about how to reveal implicit meanings in literature in order to make them get a deeper understanding of the books they read. This is also a way of supporting their development of critical literacy...|$|E

Essas desigualdade e pobreza sÃo confirmadas pelos recentes indicadores sociais, econÃmicos e ambientais coletados. Como o Projeto SÃo JosÃ faz parte de polÃticas pÃblicas para combater tal fato, e estÃ presente em 177 municÃpios, analisaram-se seus resultados entre abril de 1996 e junho de 2001, no intuito de verificar as mudanÃas no perfil socioeconÃmico e {{ambiental}} do estado, da regiÃo, do municÃpio e da comunidade. Para tanto, utilizaram-se documentos de formulaÃÃo e desempenho do projeto (Acordo de EmprÃstimo, Manuais e RelatÃrios), disponibilizados pelas instituiÃÃes envolvidas e dados e indicadores (Censo, Ãndice de Desenvolvimento Municipal, Mapa da Fome etc.) gerados e/ou trabalhados por instituiÃÃes credenciadas. As tabelas e grÃficos elaborados e os indicadores socioeconÃmicos disponibilizados possibilitaram verificar quais liberaÃÃes do projeto tiveram maior repercussÃo. Como produto, identificou-se que 78 % dos subprojetos destinaram-se Ã infra-estrutura bÃsica: 50 % para eletrificaÃÃo rural (energia domiciliar, a maioria); 24 % para abastecimento dâÃgua e 4 % para outras aÃÃes de infra-estrutura. Os subprojetos produtivos representaram 21 % do total, pulverizados entre diversas atividades: 10 % foram destinados Ã mecanizaÃÃo agrÃcola (compra de tratores, principalmente) com impacto duvidoso sobre o ambiente, enquanto a Ãrea social recebeu apenas 1 % do total dos subprojetos. Esta anÃlise mostrou uma realidade contraditÃria: avanÃo em alguns indicadores de qualidade de vida - saÃde, educaÃÃo, consumo de bens durÃveis, infraestrutura bÃsica (estrada, eletrificaÃÃo); e lentidÃo na mobilidade de algumas taxas. Na educaÃÃo, continua alto o Ãndice de analfabetismo de adultos e baixa a mÃdia de anos de estudo, principalmente na zona rural (1, 9 ano); na saÃde, persistem surtos de antigas doenÃas, entre outras. Quanto ao saneamento bÃsico, a rede coletora cobre somente 20 % da populaÃÃo; o esgotamento sanitÃrio Ã precÃrio e as redes de abastecimento dâÃgua estÃo abaixo da mÃdia nordestina. HÃ dÃficit habitacional, estradas sem manutenÃÃo e altas taxa de desemprego. A concentraÃÃo de renda, medida pelo Ãndice de Gini, Ã superior Ã encontrada para o Nordeste e Brasil. Entre 1995 e 1999, esse Ãndice caiu de 0, 62 para 0, 61. Mesmo assim continuou maior que o Ãndice nacional, 0, 59, e o nordestino, 0, 60. Os serviÃos de qualificaÃÃo e assistÃncia tÃcnica sÃo insuficientes em qualidade e quantidade para atender as demandas necessÃrias. Seu acesso continua desigual entre ricos e pobres, brancos e nÃo-brancos; homens e mulheres. O cenÃrio rural Ã mais grave, grassa pobreza. Seus indicadores situam-se abaixo dos da zona urbana, Ã exceÃÃo do desemprego. A renda familiar {{per capita}} representa apenas 46 % da mÃdia do estado e 22 % da nacional, permanecendo alta a concentraÃÃo de terra e renda. Do PSJ pode-se dizer ter sido sua contribuiÃÃo, no perÃodo, limitada na mudanÃa do perfil municipal, regional ou estadual, mesmo com o impacto detectado na eletrificaÃÃo rural domiciliar, em decorrÃncia da nÃo integraÃÃo de suas aÃÃes com as demais polÃticas existentes.

The {{objective of this}} study was the analysis of the contribution of the SÃo JosÃ Project in the reduction of the poverty and inequality in CearÃ State, Northeast of Brazil. This Project started as a contract between the government of CearÃ and the World Bank with the mainly goal of improving life conditions of the poor population in the rural zone of the state. The data analyzed, since April 1996 to June 2001, from reports, manuals, agreement of <b>loan,</b> <b>statistics</b> census, municipal development index, showed that the project reached 96 % of the cities, that is, 177 among the 184 cities of CearÃ State. In order to verify the changes in the social-economic aspects of the state, cities and communities, it were used tables and graphics with some social-economic indicators that allowed observing the effects of the different actions of the Project. It was identified that 78 % of the subprojects were applied in the basic infrastructure, being 50 % for rural electrification, mainly house electric power, 24 % for water supply and 4 % for other infrastructure activities. The productive subprojects represented 21 % of the total, sprayed among several activities, from which 10 % were applied to agricultural mechanization, mainly purchase of tractors, with doubtful impact on the soil structure. On the other side, the social area received only 1 % of the total amount from subprojects. This analysis showed a contradictory reality: improvement of some life quality indicators, such as health, education, consumption, basic infrastructure (electrification and roads) and in other side, slowness in some taxes growth. In the area of education, it was observed a high level of adults illiteracy, associated to a low school time, mainly in the rural zone (1, 9 years); as health concern, it was verified that still remains stroke of common diseases, among others. About basic sanitation, the sewerage system is precarious and attends only 20 % of the population; the water supply is very low in comparison to the average of the northeastern region. The housing projects are not attending the demand of the necessity in the region, the roads an without conservation, and the unemployment index is hight. There is a high-income concentration, measured by Gini index, which is superior to the ones in the northeast region and Brazil. Between 1995 and 1999 this index decreased from 0. 62 to 0. 61. Although, it remained above the national and northeastern values, which are 0. 59 and 0. 60, respectively. The extension service does not have satisfactory quality and quantity to attend the needs of the region. This services and assistance are not offered equally to poor and riches, whites and blacks, men and women. In the rural zone the poverty is more serious. The indicators are below to the urban area, with exception to the unemployment. The per capita family income represents only 46 % of the state average, and 22 % of the national one, remained a high concentration of income and land. Finally, {{it can be said that}} the SÃo JosÃ Project had a limited contribution to the municipal, state or regional profiles changing, despite of the enormous performance in the development of the electrification program in the rural zone.

Yet despite this continued relationship with their organization, employees often leave the organization upon receiving their MBA, resulting in losses of talent and money for the company.

But {{what do we}} do with all that data? And, in light of privacy restrictions, is it possible to get that data to connect? The Rockhurst University Library actively searched for solutions to its data problem as staff attempted to wrangle data into the visual stories that administration uses to quickly understand and make budget decisions. This presentation covers quick ways to clean messy data and prepare it for use as well as demonstrating how Access Services data can be displayed using low-cost or no cost visualization software...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Rwanda’s Fifth Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criteria. Macroeconomic {{performance}} of Rwanda remains broadly on track. Real growth in 2004 {{is estimated at}} 4 percent, mainly driven by strong activity in construction, transport, and communication. Policy implementation remained satisfactory. All but two performance criteria for the fifth review were met. Both deviations were temporary, and IMF staff recommends waivers.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} 2007 has brought to the fore the issues of excesses in lending, leverage, and risk-taking {{as some of the}} fundamental causes of this crisis. At the same time, in dealing with the {{financial crisis}} there have been large scale interventions by governments, often referred to as bailouts of the lenders. This paper presents a framework where rational economic agents engage in ex ante excessive lending, borrowing, and risk-taking if creditors assign a positive probability to being bailed out. The paper also offers some thoughts on policy implications. It argues that it would be most productive for the long run if lending institutions were not bailed out. If the continuing existence of an institution was deemed essential, assistance should take the form of capital injections that dilute the equity of existing owners.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Tajikistan’s Fifth Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and Request for Waiver of Performance Criterion. The macroeconomic {{outcome in}} the first quarter of 2005 was satisfactory, but the deteriorating external environment will make it harder to achieve some of the program’s original targets. Expenditure delays and strong nontax revenues resulted in a significant fiscal surplus {{in the first}} quarter of 2005. The fiscal outlook for the remainder of 2005 looks less favorable owing to lower-than-projected commodity prices.
