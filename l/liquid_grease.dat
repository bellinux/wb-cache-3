40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial {{environmental}} {{factors such as}} the very low ambient pressure and the absencc of oxygen on lubrication are discussed. The low pressure causes liquids, and even solids, to boil away, so that their vapour pressure and evaporation rates become important. Evaporation experiments with mctals, <b>liquids,</b> <b>greases</b> and solid lubricants are discussed. Silicone oils and silicone-based greases appear to have the lowest evaporative loss among the fluids investigated. Bearing experiments indicate that <b>liquids</b> and <b>greases,</b> when properly shielded, can provide longer bearing lives than bonded solid lubricants or metal platings. Silicone fluids yield the best bearing life, confirming the results of evaporation tests. Life results with bonded solid films are generally poor. Kesults are considerably better when the solid lubricant is used as a constituent in a solid-composite material. Bearing reliability in space applications may be a problem because considerable life scatter is observed where a particular lubricant or lubrication techniqueis evaluated in multiple tests.

40|$|Abstract: Results {{from the}} design of a {{high-pressure}} chamber and its components, recently developed at the Lund Institute of Technology, are presented. The results show that at high pressures, when the lubricants have solidified, the density varies linearly with the pressure and the shear strength also increases nearly linearly with pressure. This is also true for the inves-tigated gasses when they are compressed through the liquid into the solid state. Also waxes, which are solid at room pressure and temperature, show the same type of linearity. The high-pressure chamber has been used for pressures up to 3. 3 GPa for a large number of compression experiments in the present form. It has been used for compressibility, shear strength, and viscosity measurements, and gasses, <b>liquids,</b> semi-solids (<b>greases),</b> and solids have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The weight-loss rate in {{vacuum of}} 18 {{lubricating}} <b>liquids</b> and <b>greases</b> is reported for temperatures up to 120 C. Eleven types of 'medium-viscosity' (20 to 52 centistokes at 40 C) fluids were studied. In addition, {{a variety of}} perfluoro ether liquids having viscosities of 350 to 500 centistokes at 40 C were investigated, as were some commercial greases based on these liquids. The results showed that a methylchlorophenyl silicone, a high-viscosity-index perfluoro ether research fluid, and a polyoctene have suitably low outgassing properties for long-term space applicaitons requiring a medium-viscosity lubricant. Perfluoro ether greases also displayed low outgassing, but batch-to-batch variation was great. Mass spectrometer measurements indicated that the outgassed species were characterized by much lower molecular weights than that expected for the liquids. This suggests that lubricant transfer techniques which rely on evaporation from a reservoir may not be desirable for long-term space applications...|$|R

40|$|Static {{tests were}} made on the {{compatibility}} of liquid fluorine with several nonmetallic materials at - 3200 F and at pressures of 0 and 1500 {{pounds per square inch}} gage. The results are compared with those from previous work with gaseous fluorine at the same pressures, but at atmospheric temperature. In general, although environmental effects were not always consistent, reactivity was least with the low-temperature, low-pressure liquid fluorine. Reactivity was greatest with the warm, high-pressure gaseous fluorine. None of the <b>liquids</b> and <b>greases</b> tested was found to be entirely suitable for use in fluorine systems. Polytrifluorochloroethylene and N- 43, the formula for which is (C 4 F 9) 3 N, did not react with liquid fluorine at atmospheric pressure or 1500 pounds per square inch gage under static conditions, but they did react when injected into liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage; they also reacted with gaseous fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage. While water did not react with liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage, it is known to react violently with fluorine under other conditions. The pipe-thread lubricant Q-Seal did not react with liquid fluorine, but did react with gaseous fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage. Of the solids, ruby (Al 2 O 3) and Teflon did not react under the test conditions.

40|$|Preventing {{black powder}} {{contamination}} from damaging a gas pipeline’s metering system requires regular dismantling and cleaning of its metering instruments, manifolds, impulse lines, and associated facilities. Determining which cleaning method to apply, however, requires gathering comprehensive {{information about the}} nature of the black powder problem. Only then can the operator determine which technique will provide the most efficient and cost-effective method of removing black powder from gas installations. Background Solid contaminants—known as black powder—found in natural gas transmission and distribution systems are a cause of increasing concern in the global natural gas industry.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{induction}} of ultrasonic waves {{is restricted}} to conducting materials – like eddy current testing – because it involves inducing eddy currents in {{the surface of the}} part by a near-by coil of wire. A magnetic field supplied by a near-by magnet interacts with this eddy current to produce a mechanical force on the surface to excite ultrasonic vibrations. The same configuration of coil and magnet also detects mechanical motion of the surface because the motion of a conductor in a magnetic field produces currents that are detected and measured by the near-by coil. This transduction by induction has the following advantages for NDT: (1) The “near-by ” feature implies an air gap next to the part surface and, thus, no coupling <b>liquid</b> or <b>grease</b> layer is present to restrict the range of temperatures or inspection speeds available for testing. (2) The fact that the transduction process takes place within a thin layer at the surface of the part allows the time-of-flight (or phase) of the ultrasonic wave to be measured with great accuracy so that dimensions and physical properties of materials can be used for quality assurance purposes. (3) The shape of the coil and the direction of the magnetic field allow the type (shear or longitudinal) and direction of propagation of the wave to be controlled by the transducer design. (4) Special wave types (e. g., shear horizontal, Lamb, Rayleigh) are readily available to satisfy unusual inspection problems.

40|$|The electromagnetic, noncontact {{transducer}} (EMAT) {{is particularly}} {{well suited to}} ultrasonic inspection problems where it is difficult or impossible to couple the sound into the object being tested through a <b>liquid</b> or <b>grease</b> layer. For inspecting buried natural gas pipelines, the inspection process {{must be carried out}} by a self contained instrument package blown through the pipe by the gas stream. This demands that the transducers move with speeds of 10 to 20 mph a long the pipe and give continuous · operation over distances of 50 to 100 miles. Under the sponsorship of the American Gas Association, it has been demonstrated that EMAT 2 ̆ 7 s designed to launch and detect Lamb waves which propagate around the circumference of the pipe can meet these inspection requirements. · The special transducers designed for this purpose used conductors laid down in a meander line configuration with the spacing between the adjacent lines chosen to be equal to one half of the wave length of the first antisymmetric Lamb wave mode of the pipe wall (a flexure wave) at the operating frequency of 130 KHz. These Lamb waves were focused into a beam of energy and directed around the pipe circumference so that when they encountered a longitudinal stress corrosion crack or a region of pit corrosion, the reflection of energy could be used to detect the location and approximate size of the defect. Both transmitters and receivers were fabricated and the detection of simulated defects machined into the outside surface of a 36 -inch dia. by 40 -foot long section of pipe buried at the Science Center has been demonstrated.

40|$|In certain applications, {{including}} {{high temperature}} or vacuum environments, <b>liquid</b> lubricants or <b>greases</b> are not stable. Solid lubricants are potentially suitable {{candidates for the}} reduction of friction and wear. Ceramic materials are a suitable candidate for harsh environments such as high temperatures and vacuum. Ceramic components are generally lubricated by thin solid films to achieve low friction and wear. The lifetime of such films is inevitably limited. By incorporating solid lubricant reservoirs into a hard ceramic matrix, friction and wear can be decreased during sliding by realizing a gradual replenishment of the soft solid lubricant to the surface. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the self-lubricating ability of the ceramic contact. In this thesis, a CuO doped zirconia composite has been chosen as a self-lubricating ceramic composite system. The tribological performance of the ceramic composite has been systematically investigated. To understand the self-lubricating ability of the composite, the friction behaviour has been studied at different temperature levels. First, dry sliding tests were conducted at room temperature using different loads and sliding velocities as well as countersurfaces. The wear mechanisms have been investigated using different characterization methods. At room temperature, 5 CuO-TZP only shows low friction and wear against an alumina countersurface. Similar dry sliding tests {{have been carried out}} at elevated temperatures. A coefficient of friction of 0. 35 and a specific wear rate less than 10 - 6 mm 3 /Nm were obtained at 600 °C for CuO-TZP sliding against an alumina countersurface. It has been found that a soft copper rich (third body) layer is formed at the interface between the sliding components. The formation of the soft layer as well as the wear mechanism has been explained. A physically-based model has been developed which includes the processes responsible for maintaining the soft third body layer at the interface. The model can predict the thickness of the third body layer under different tribological conditions in the mild wear regime. It can be concluded that the tribological performance of CuO-TZP under dry contact conditions strongly depends on the operational conditions...|$|R
40|$|Conventional liquid {{lubricants}} {{are faced}} with limitations under extreme cyclic operating conditions, such as in applications that require lubrication when changing from atmospheric pressure to ultrahigh vacuum and ambient air to dry nitrogen (e. g., satellite components), and room to elevated (> 500 °C) temperatures (e. g., aerospace bearings). Alternatively, solid lubricant coatings {{can be used in}} conditions where synthetic <b>liquid</b> lubricants and <b>greases</b> are not applicable; however, individual solid lubricant phases usually perform best only for a limited range of operating conditions. Therefore, solid lubricants that can adequately perform over a wider range of environmental conditions are needed, especially during thermal cycling with temperatures exceeding 500 °C. One potential material class investigated in this dissertation is lubricious oxides, because unlike other solid lubricant coatings they are typically thermodynamically stable in air and at elevated temperatures. While past studies have been focused on binary metal oxide coatings, such as ZnO, there have been very few ternary oxide and no reported quaternary oxide investigations. The premise behind the addition of the third and fourth refractory metals Ti and Zr is {{to increase the number of}} hard and wear resistant phases while maintaining solid lubrication with ZnO. Therefore, the major focus of this dissertation is to investigate the processing-structure-tribological property relations of composite ZnO, TiO 2 and ZrO 2 phases that form ternary (ZnTi) xOy and quaternary (ZnTiZr) xOy nanocrystalline coatings. The coatings were processed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a selective variation of ALD parameters. The growth structure and chemical composition of as-deposited and ex situ annealed ternary and quaternary oxide coatings were studied by combined x-ray diffraction/focused ion beam microscopy/cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/Auger electron spectroscopy, respectively. It was determined that the structure varied from purely nanocrystalline (ternary oxides) to composite amorphous/nanocrystalline (quaternary oxides) depending on ALD parameters and annealing temperatures. In particular, the ZnTiO 3 ilmenite phase with (104) textured nanocolumnar grains, exhibiting high stacking fault/partial dislocation densities > 1012 /cm 2, was responsible for the excellent tribological behavior. Steady-state sliding friction coefficients down to 0. 12 in humid air and 0. 2 in dry nitrogen were measured along with sliding and fretting wear factors in the range of 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 mm 3 /N·m, even after ex situ annealing to 550 °C. Additionally, the quaternary oxide phase Zn(Ti,Zr) O 3 in solid solution exhibited a low fretting wear rate of 1 x 10 - 6 mm 3 /N·m. In contrast, certain phases, such as Zn 2 TiO 4 cubic spinel, that form at annealing temperatures > 550 °C were responsible for high friction and wear. Mechanistic studies using the above techniques revealed low friction and wear-reducing surfaces and subsurfaces were due to different velocity accommodation modes (VAM). In the case of the ternary system, sliding-induced plastic deformation was possible when ZnTiO 3 (104) stacking faults, bordered by partial dislocations, serve as a pathway for the dislocations to glide parallel to the sliding direction and hence achieve low friction and wear via an intrafilm shear VAM. It was evident that the individual nanocolumnar ZnTiO 3 grains were plastically sheared as opposed to being fractured during wear. Conversely for the quaternary system, an interfacial sliding VAM between the counterface and a mechanically mixed layer (tribofilm) composed of the refined coating and counterface material, that also served as a source for the formation of cylindrical rolls, was responsible for wear reduction. Therefore, these lubricious oxides are a potential candidate for solid lubrication at high temperatures (up to 550 °C) and in space environments...|$|R
