In this paper we provide a technical description of Virtual Sky and the test conditions. We compared static light to two different dynamic lighting conditions. Our findings indicate that the acceptance of dynamic lighting depends on the performed tasks. Furthermore, for test candidates without access to natural daylight, subjective tiredness after one working day was significantly lower under a cloud animation compared to static light. Well-being decreased significantly less under a cloud animation compared to static light...|$|E

40|$|The digital {{phenomena}} {{constitute a}} fundamental change in how designers accomplish a wide range of the complex processes of design. This thesis investigates the use of computation in the context of architectural lighting design. It particularly looks into how cutting edge computational tools [...] such as digital fabrication and parametric tools [...] can be combined with the Light Emitting Diodes (LED) technology to create luminous architectural elements. Work in this field is of most relevance in a moment when the implementation of LED systems is expected to establish a new paradigm in architectural illumination. Results from recent technology roadmaps show that by the year 2020 LEDs will be replacing incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lamps and will become the primary choice for general lighting applications. Because LED architectural applications are not widely understood by the industry, a successful implementation process will be highly dependant on multidisciplinary design research, where many design experimentations will have to occur. New approaches are needed where the technical advantages of LEDs - they are more efficient, have longer life of operation, are rugged and compact, produce the entire color spectrum, and are fully controllable - are used to promote better lighting design quality. It is in this context that my research takes place, utilizing advanced computational tools to explore innovative design possibilities for lighting systems with embedded LEDs. This thesis describes a sequence of experiments to design and build a system of <b>luminous</b> <b>ceiling</b> tiles made of acrylic pieces and equipped with embedded LEDs. First, I use programming to generate parametric 3 D models of the ceiling tiles. A series of(cont.) variations of an initial design of the tiles are accomplished through the manipulation of control parameters. After the first set of 3 D models is created, I use digital fabrication techniques to build prototypes of the models, which are tested with LEDs and evaluated in terms of their lighting performance. Finally, I develop the experiments to create an entire <b>luminous</b> <b>ceiling</b> area, and the design achieves an overall result rather than being restricted to individual elements. Advanced lighting systems enhance the quality, flexibility and cost effectiveness of light, and digital fabrication techniques improve the optimization of computer-based methods of design. The results of my experiments show that lighting systems can greatly benefit from the testing of the design and the technical performance before installation in the architectural space. In this context, parametric tools and digital fabrication technologies demonstrate exceptional wealth for both the conceptual and the optimization phases of lighting design in architecture. by Rita Saad.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{within the field of}} {{daylight}} in buildings. The purpose of the work has been to investigate how daylighting systems could improve the daylight uniformity and increase the daylight levels in the inner part of sidelighted offices. This is studied through full-scale and scale model experiments together with computer simulations. In sidelighted interiors the available daylight decreases rapidly with the distance from the window. The main parameters influencing the daylight distribution are daylight availability, building and window location, surface photometric properties and room geometry. The first part of the thesis shows which effect these parameters have for the daylight distribution. Daylighting systems are modifications in the windows with the intention of redirecting incoming daylight into the darker zones of deep rooms. It can be special types of glass, reflectors or other optical systems that reject, scatter or redirect the daylight in controlled directions. A lot of different daylighting systems are available, and those suitable for windows are presented shortly. A more detailed presentation is given for those systems investigated for quantitative performances; light shelves, venetian blind, prismatic panels and laser-cut panels. These daylighting systems were investigated in full-scale measurements under natural sky conditions and under an artificial overcast sky. The full-scale experiments were carried out under the natural sky in six daily occupied office rooms situated in Sandvika, near Oslo. Five rooms were adapted for experimental measurements of daylighting systems and one room was used as reference without daylighting system. In total four daylighting systems were examined; two light shelves with different surface properties, one prismatic panel and one laser-cut panel. The daylighting systems were investigated under both overcast sky and clear sky conditions. The results show that frequently changes in the sky luminance distribution make reproducibility of results difficult, and it was found that further daylighting experiments should be performed in more controllable surroundings. As a consequence, calibrations and fundamental tests were carried out for a newly built artificial sky in the daylight laboratory at the Department of Building technology, NTNU. The artificial sky, an octagonal box consisting of a <b>luminous</b> <b>ceiling</b> with mirrored walls which produce an infinite series of reflections. The distance between corresponding pairs of parallel mirrors is approximately 3. 5 m, and the height of the box is 1. 5 m. The investigations showed good reproducibility for quantitative daylighting measurements. The results also showed good agreement with corresponding experiments under both natural and artificial overcast sky performed by other researchers. A sample group of daylighting systems were evaluated with the objectives to increase the daylight level in the intermediate and rear part of a sidelighted room, and to level out the daylight distribution throughout the working plane. A corresponding model situation without any window modifications served as reference. Only a few of the investigated daylighting systems showed satisfactory performance data with respect to the evaluation parameters. • Exterior light shelves level out the daylight distribution throughout the room depth. Depending on the shelf and ceiling surface properties a positive angle of inclination can increase the daylight level in the rear wall zone up to 55 %. • Laser-cut panels vertically fixed on the facade give a more uniform daylight distribution. A positive cut angle of 10 ° can increase the daylight level in the inner part of the room with 25 % to 50 %. • Tilted laser-cut panels above the daylight window produce somewhat better daylight uniformity in the working area. Depending of tilt angle and ceiling properties the daylight evel in the rear wall zone can be increased up to 25 %. The strategy of these daylighting systems is to utilize daylight from the bright zenith of the sky vault to increase the daylight levels in the inner part of the rooms. The investigations show that the relative effect increases {{as a function of the}} height of the horizon obstruction. Daylighting systems can thus be an effective solution to increase the daylight levels in situations where obstructions reduce the daylight to unacceptable levels. To prepare for adequate daylight conditions in the interior there is a need for instructions related to the site planning stage. By computer simulations, a parameter study evaluated how the obstruction height and surface reflectances influence the daylight level in a sidelighted office room. The results showed that: • A horizon obstruction angle should be kept smaller than 25 ° to give potential for good daylighting in the interior of a sidelighted room. • A critical obstruction angle of 40 ° should not be exceeded. • For obstruction angles between these two values more detailed analyses should be carried out. Factors to be considered for each specific building are the window design (area and location), the room depth and the surface reflectances within and outside the building. This work has focused on quantitative performance data for daylighting systems under overcast sky conditions. To obtain a complete picture for the selected systems, the following investigations should also be performed: • mapping of data under sun conditions • evaluation of other performance parameters (luminance distribution, glare etc) Attention should also be paid to daylighting systems not considered in this work. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to autonomous glass pictures, Gass has created many interiors with glass doors, <b>luminous</b> <b>ceilings</b> and room dividers. The designs convey a harmonious relationship in its placement {{and create a}} strong tie between its environment and the people within it.He has also immersed himself {{in the field of}} solar technology and designed the façade of a high bay warehouse in Coeseld-Lette using photovoltaic modules.The warehouse's folded design of the solar modules extends vertically, bending over the roof and hovering on a framed mounted system above the landscaped roof. The facade is constructed out of deep-black solar modules and greenish-blue sparkling crash glass, two contrasting components generating an electrifying force. The folding effect arises from the installation of the two main elements on the solar facade: alternating, solar modules and crash glass are arranged gradually in a 32° angle of inclination, which guarantees an optimal solar radiation at the geographical location of Coesfeld.This folded, cascading arrangement of the PV-modules not only optimally uses the sun’s energy, but also provides shade for the glass building behind it. The interior of the warehouse requires no additional cooling. In winter, when the sun is low and the rays are flat, the shading effect is limited and consequently heating is not necessary. As a result, the warehouse can be operated with only an automatic ventilation system. A unique and exemplary symbiosis of engineering and design, his artistic approach to the photovoltaic facade received the architecture award of the Stiftung Deutsche Pfandbriefbank.His highly innovative method of fusing a crash glass picture into single pane safety glass without the use of additional adhesives is patented.|$|R

5000|$|Lighting of new {{buildings}} was {{less of an}} architectural preoccupation at first {{than it had been}} before the war, since the uninterrupted facades of the International Style did not have setbacks to facilitate floodlighting. New approaches were required; buildings including Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Manufacturers Trust bank branch building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, completed in 1954, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson, and Ely Jacques Kahn's Seagram Building, completed in 1958, used glass walls and <b>luminous</b> <b>ceilings</b> to create a [...] "tower of light," [...] an updating of the technique of trans-illumination, that is, illuminating the building from within, that had been developed in Europe in the 1920s. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote of the Manufacturers Hanover Building: [...] "The whole, viewed from the outside, is no longer architectural in the traditional sense: it is a design, not of substance, but of color, light and motion." [...] The same year, the Tishman Building by Carson & Lundin created a [...] "tower of light" [...] in quite a different way, updating the American tradition of exterior floodlighting: Abe Feder's lighting design used mercury vapor lamps to evenly illuminate the aluminum facade so as to recreate the building's daytime appearance, with the accent feature of the address, [...] "666," [...] picked out in red neon at the top. Architects and critics rediscovered the possibilities of light, apparently unaware of the pre-war discussions. For example, also in 1958 a New York Times writer declared [...] "lighting as an art that combines function and decoration" [...] to be [...] "one of the big advances in recent years in architecture". Gio Ponti condemned floodlighting as [...] "primitive and barbaric" [...] and predicted [...] "a new nocturnal city":Lighting will become an essential element of spatial architecture[...] [...] [...] By a predesigned self-illumination this architecture will present formal night effects never yet imagined - illusions of spaces, of voids, of alternations of volumes, weights, and surfaces[...] [...] [...] We artists will create luminously corporal entities of form. His 1960 Pirelli Tower in Milan was a prominent example of postwar European night architecture, using ceiling fluorescent lights in the three vertical sections into which the building is divided, and rooftop floodlights reflecting off the bottom of a cantilevered roof; Walter Gropius and Pietro Belluschi's Pan Am Building was influenced by its form but used floodlighting at night.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{conversation}} with the staff from Sharp, we decided to highlight {{the integration of the}} proposed system with the Units shown during the meeting. We have therefore developed and detailed design of the large dome proposal in the first stage keeping in mind, however, that the Units may also be integrated in the devices of the suspensions and of desk design. The choice of the dome is motivated by three considerations: one hand we have preferred, given the time available to investigate only one of the proposed topics; in terms of size and performance, the dome expresses the best, the complexity of the choices made; Units built in the last dome form a constellation of radial lights reminding formal characteristics of known elements of lighting culture of the architectural and design. In the lighting culture exists in fact the Sky Simulator, which are lighting devices able to mimic changes in sunlight. These devices are used for the simulation of the solar radiation, received by the buildings reproduced in scale and placed underneath the simulator. In the architectural reference, is that of “Ventana des Esterellas all’Alambra” of Cordoba, or <b>luminous</b> <b>ceilings</b> of buildings made of concrete-glass, while the design is reminiscent of the effect of light textured made by some Italian lamps successfully produced in the 90 ’s. These references refer to a Light Skype connecting the light source to the sky, to the choreography of lights in it and, in reference to the Light Simulator, to changes in sunlight. Each single unit can play these variations both in brightness and in colour temperature, because the individual Unit are in fact interconnected by bus DMX and controlled by a central unit that can be driven even in remote or wireless. The variation of colour temperature may be produced by both the identical and simultaneous variation of light in all units, or by the additive synthesis produced by summation of different lights produced by the individual units. In this case, the dome will be able to modify continuously the temperature from 2700 K to 6500 K, in this case the colour of the light emitted may be variable and will follow the circadian rhythm. The variation of the brightness and colour temperature achieved in an indoor environment, and even if not consciously perceived, reproduces the changing of sunlight and gives a wellness and reduces the fatigue from the ennui fixed and constant lighting. The dome, as already said, will also issue colored lights, when all the units simultaneously or to additive synthesis will produce a frequency 460 nm, said Blue Sky you will get a light capable of inhibiting the production of melatonin favouring the mental activities and the ‘attention. And ‘in fact a particular blue part of the spectrum of light that has a powerful effect and uplifting. Inside the eye, a family of specialized cells are sensitive for ‘see’ the blue colour of the sky that has a frequency of 460 nm. When these photo-receptors transposing the blue light,the nerve impulses of the brain detect, waking up, increasing attention and concentration. The dome will realize a complex system that will not only light but also will promote the well-being and physical and mental activities of those who will be working, discussing and thinking in their luminous and iridescent protectio...|$|R
