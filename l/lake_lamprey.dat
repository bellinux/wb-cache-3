50|$|The Miller <b>Lake</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Entosphenus minimus) is {{a species}} of lamprey in the Petromyzontidae family endemic to the United States. Its natural habitat is the Miller Lake drainage.|$|E
50|$|The Miller <b>Lake</b> <b>lamprey</b> was {{presumed to}} be extinct until 1992, when it was {{collected}} again. Continued collection efforts yielded more animals, and in 2000, the group published a paper on the rediscription of this lamprey. In an attempt to restore and protect the Miller <b>Lake</b> <b>lamprey,</b> restoration efforts to remove the barrier originally have been carried out, and surveys are done regularly to establish {{an understanding of the}} population's health. Understanding how evolutionary forces could drive speciation of a dwarf parasitic species of lamprey is a potential new area of research for scientists.|$|E
25|$|Control of sea {{lampreys}} in the Great Lakes {{is conducted}} by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and is coordinated by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. Lake Champlain, bordered by New York, Vermont, and Quebec, and New York's Finger Lakes are also home to high populations of sea lampreys that warrant control. <b>Lake</b> Champlain's <b>lamprey</b> control program is managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

25|$|Birds {{living in}} the Southern Coast Range include a variety of smaller and larger bird species. Species include {{peregrine}} falcons, pileated woodpeckers, olive-sided flycatcher, and western bluebirds among others. The threatened northern spotted owl also inhabit the mountain forests. Animal life in the rivers, streams, and <b>lakes</b> include <b>lamprey,</b> coastal cutthroat trout, dace, Umpqua chub, frogs, salamander, turtles, coho salmon, steelhead trout, and others.|$|R
50|$|An adult <b>lake</b> <b>lamprey</b> is {{dark blue}} or dark brown with a lighter belly, {{and the body}} is 11.8-27.3 cm in length. The lamprey's disc-like mouth is filled with sharp teeth. The Vancouver lamprey has eyes {{on the top of}} its head, two dorsal fins, a caudal fin, and an anal fin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lake</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{is found}} only in the Cowichan and Mesachie Lakes on Vancouver Island, and is not migratory. The lamprey lives and spawns in shallow gravel areas and {{typically}} remains in the lake rather than venturing up streams. They {{have been found to}} be capable of surviving in saltwater through experimentation, but remain in fresh water in the wild. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 live in the entirety of the two lakes as adults.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} of special {{interest}} because it has an extremely limited distribution, with all known animals contained within a single small drainage system {{and it is the}} smallest known parasitic lamprey in the world. The Miller <b>lake</b> <b>lamprey</b> was presumed extinct in 1958, after state fishery managers attempted to eradicate the lamprey from the lake because it was feeding on the introduced trout. The known larval streams for this lamprey were treated with lampricide and a barrier was erected to prevent adults from entering to spawn.|$|E
50|$|Lake trout were fished commercially in the Great <b>Lakes</b> until <b>lampreys,</b> overharvest and {{pollution}} extirpated or severely reduced the stocks. Commercial fisheries still exist {{in some areas}} of the Great Lakes and smaller lakes in northern Canada. Commercial fishing by Ojibwe for Lake Trout in the Lake Superior is permitted under various treaties and regulated by the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC).|$|R
25|$|Invasive {{species are}} a problem for <b>Lake</b> Ontario, {{particularly}} <b>lamprey</b> and zebra mussels. Lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed. Zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control, and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-one {{species of}} fish have been {{documented}} in fresh waters in the park. Differences in fish distribution depend on drainage: northern pike are not seen in the Copper River drainages, and no salmon species are seen in Yukon River drainages. Large freshwater fish include Chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye salmon, {{as well as other}} salmonids such as lake trout, cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, Arctic grayling and rainbow trout. Other fish include eulachon, burbot, round whitefish, northern pike, Pacific <b>lamprey,</b> <b>lake</b> chub and a variety of sculpins.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Fish passage devices {{often fail}} {{for either of}} two reasons: (1) {{individuals}} fail to encounter and recognize the passage device, or (2) fail to successfully negotiate the device once encountered. In the Laurentian Great <b>Lakes</b> the sea <b>lamprey</b> Petromyzon marinus is an invasive pest, threatening the persistence of important commercial and recreational fisheries. For ten years we have been examining the sea lamprey migration and the roles that semiochemicals play in guiding movements, the selection of habitats, and mating behavior. Here, we present evidence from numerous field experiments designed to reveal {{the extent to which}} attractive and repulsive conspecific odors may be used to guide migrating lampreys into watersheds, river channels, and devices associated with dams. The evidence strongly suggests that lampreys may be effectively guided to fish passage entrances (and away from dangerous areas, such as water intake structures) through the manipulation of chemical information. We discuss the implications of these findings for achieving improved lamprey conservation...|$|R
40|$|Unionid mussels are {{critical}} to aquatic ecosystem function and are imperiled. They are indicators of biological integrity due to sensitivity to stressors and interconnectedness with the aquatic community. Like unionids, invasive sea lamprey larvae (Petromyzon marinus) burrow into stream sediments. Sea lampreys have seriously impacted {{the ecology of the}} Great <b>Lakes.</b> Sea <b>lamprey</b> control consists of lampricides targeting the larval stage (ammocoetes) in tributaries. Lampricides have sublethal effects on mussels. This study investigated mussel and ammocoete distribution and habitat use to aid in refining lampricide application. Habitat and mussel surveys were conducted in the Paw Paw River, in Southwest Michigan, and ammoceote data were obtained from databases of sea lamprey surveys conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Mussels were absent in most tributaries and had a mean density of 0. 59 /m² in the mainstem. Ammocoetes had a mean density of 0. 43 /m² and densities were highest in tributaries. A statewide regression analysis revealed that mussels have species specific distribution determinants and a canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated this species specific pattern in the Paw Paw River. Generalized linear models revealed median particle size, gradient, and bank stability to be effective predictors of unionid distribution in the Paw Paw River. Distance to sea lamprey spawning habitat and bank stability were effective predictors of ammocoete distribution. Minimal overlap of mussel and ammocoete distributions suggests that refinement of lampricide treatment in the Paw Paw River is possible. Redefining the extent of the mainstem reach and dividing it into several shorter reaches so that only areas with high ammocoete densities and low unionid densities would be treated with lampricide could result in reducing treatment costs and minimizing threats to unionid conservation while still having continued success in controlling sea lamprey...|$|R
40|$|Female {{sea lamprey}} (Petromyzon marinus) seek males through {{chemical}} cues of a sex pheromone. Female choice {{experiments in the}} Great Lakes indicated females were responsive to sex pheromone in half of the trials and could differentiate among concentrations of sex pheromones emitted from traps; i. e., females entered traps with higher concentrations. Those results were corroborated in experiments with <b>Lake</b> Champlain sea <b>lamprey.</b> However, none of these studies conducted experiments {{in the presence of}} background pheromone, which would be present under natural conditions. We conducted female choice experiments in which we stocked mature males (n = 3 - 9) for the purpose of providing competing pheromone in a 50 -m stream enclosure in Malletts Creek, a tributary to Lake Champlain,. The equivalent of pheromone released by 0, 1, 3, 9, or 27 males was pumped through a lamprey pot 35 m upstream of a release cage containing a female. In each trial, lasting a maximum of 1 hour, a female was released and her behavior and movements were recorded through visual observations and antenna readings. Females swam to a pheromone source or swam upstream moving rocks in 1...|$|R

40|$|The exotic {{sea lamprey}} (Petromyzon marinus) contributed greatly to collapses of fish {{populations in the}} Laurentian Great Lakes in the mid 1900 s (Christie 1974). Despite {{stringent}} population control actions in the 1950 s and 1960 s, sea lamprey persist and continue to affect populations of host fishes. The relative importance of different host species to sea lamprey production is unknown. Therefore, we used stable isotope analysis to ask whether sea <b>lamprey</b> in <b>Lake</b> Superior derive most of their production from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), as is often assumed, or from alternative hosts. The stable isotope ratio of nitrogen (δ 15 N) in a consumer’s tissues indicates its trophic level, whereas carbon (δ 13 C) indicates its base of production (Harvey et al., 2002). We collected transforming, parasitic, and spawning <b>Lake</b> Superior sea <b>lamprey.</b> Transformers and parasites came from eastern U. S. waters. Spawners as well as four potential hosts (lake herring, Coregonus artedii; bloater, C. hoyi; lean lake trout; siscowet lake trout) were captured throughout U. S. waters. We measured 63 δ 15 N and δ 13 C in sea lamprey muscle and host blood. We then compared empirical δ 15 N of sea <b>lamprey</b> in eastern <b>Lake</b> Superior to values predicted by a model, developed by Harvey et al. (2002), that estimates stable isotope ratios as functions of growth, based on bioenergetics. Simulations ran one year, during which sea lamprey fed exclusively on one of four hosts (shallow-water coregonines, lean lake trout, siscowet lake trout, or deepwater coregonines) ...|$|R
50|$|Sea {{lampreys}} {{are considered}} a pest in the Great Lakes region. The species is native to the inland Finger Lakes and Lake Champlain in New York and Vermont. Whether it is native to Lake Ontario, where it was first noticed in the 1830s, {{or whether it was}} introduced through the Erie Canal which opened in 1825 is not clear. Improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919 are thought to have allowed its spread from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, and while it was never abundant in either lake, it soon spread to Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s. They have created a problem with their aggressive parasitism on key predator species and game fish, such as lake trout, lake whitefish, chub, and lake herring. Elimination of these predators allowed the alewife, another invasive species, to explode in population, having adverse effects on many native fish species. The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout is considered an apex predator, which means that it has no predators. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior <b>lake</b> trout population. <b>Lamprey</b> introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes' ecosystem then became unbalanced.|$|R
40|$|Sea {{lampreys}} (Petromyzon marinus) are parasitic pests in the Great Lakes {{which have}} negatively impacted game fish populations. Management {{efforts to control}} sea lamprey populations throughout the Great Lakes began in the 1950 s and continue today. The primary control technique used is the application of lampricides to streams to kill larvae before they become parasites. A better understanding of larval sea lamprey growth rates, age determination, and habitat preference is greatly needed to improve both selection of streams for lampricide application and to inform models of sea lamprey population dynamics. Otoliths {{have been used to}} estimate age in teleost fish through annuli counts and otolith size metrics. Lampreys do not have otoliths, having instead an analogous structure called a statolith. Determining age based on statolith annuli counts {{has been found to be}} imprecise and inaccurate. Therefore, I evaluated whether statolith size is correlated with sea lamprey larva, also known as ammocoete, age using known-age populations of ammocoetes from two contrasting Great Lakes streams. Statolith width was found to be the measurement that better distinguished the age-classes within the populations. When combining length-frequency and statolith width data into a likelihood-based statistical model I was able to more accurately assess ammocoete population age composition for one known-age population than when using only length-frequency data. Studies of the biology and ecology of Great <b>Lakes</b> sea <b>lampreys</b> (Petromyzon marinus) may require an effective means of tagging larvae to track individual movements to better control this pest species. I evaluated the feasibility of using passive integrated transponder (PIT) and visible implant (VI) Alpha tags in larval sea lampreys at least 100 mm and 85 mm in length, respectively. The use of PIT tags in lampreys as small as 100 mm in length is not suggested unless a tag burden of less than 5 % can be achieved. Until a better method of wound closure is found to limit VI Alpha tag loss in lampreys, the use of these tags is not suggested in lampreys as small as those used in this study. If habitat preference, depth distribution, or in-stream distribution changes as larvae approach metamorphosis, as anecdotal evidence suggests, there is a potential for bias in the current ranking surveys which make the assumption that larval lampreys occupy habitat in the same proportion irrespective of size. To monitor the movement and preferred habitats of large larvae, I marked and released larvae approaching metamorphic size and subsequently tracked their movements. I used three different tagging methods, including passive integrated transponders (PIT) tags, visible implant (VI) Alpha tags, and visible implant elastomer (VIE) tags to mark larvae. Using PIT telemetry and electrofishing, I was able to locate 11 % of our released ammocoetes. It was found that the larger ammocoetes moved further distances downstream from release locations than the smaller ammocoetes...|$|R
40|$|Sea {{lampreys}} (Petromyzon marinus) have {{a complex}} life cycle that involves a parasitic phase {{in which they}} feed on the blood and bodily fluids of large piscivorous fishes. Following {{the invasion of the}} Great <b>Lakes</b> by sea <b>lampreys</b> in the early 20 th century, sea lamprey parasitism contributed to major declines in the populations of commercial and sports fisheries in that basin. The lampricide 3 -trifluoromethyl- 4 -nitrophenol (TFM), developed in the late 1950 s,is now routinely applied to tributaries of the Great Lakes to control sea lamprey populations. This lampricide is selectively toxic to larval sea lampreys, which typically reside as burrow-dwelling filter-feeders in streams. Although the TFM concentrations commonly applied to streams and rivers is 1. 2 - 1. 5 times the 9 h LC 99. 9 (minimum lethal concentration; MLC) of the larvae, surviving residual sea lamprey may be observed after treatments. The underlying causes for “residuals” are poorly understood, however. The main goal of my M. Sc. thesis was to determine how body size and life stage influenced TFM uptake, excretion andsurvival of larval sea lampreys following TFM exposure. Because rates of oxygen consumption (ṀO 2) are inversely proportional to body size in animals, I predicted that correspondingly lower rates of ventilation would result in lower rates of TFM uptake and greater TFM tolerance in larger compared to smaller larval sea lampreys. As predicted, smaller lampreys had exponentially higher rates of ṀO 2 and TFM uptake compared to larger animals. I alsopredicted that due to higher metabolic demands, more activepost-metamorphic sea lampreys would have higher TFM uptake rates compared to larval sea lampreys. Surprisingly, both ṀO 2 and TFM uptake rates were similar in size matched larval and post-metamorphic sea lampreys. Body mass wasalso correlated with TFM elimination, following intraperitoneal injection of TFM, but there were no differences in the TFM clearance rates between larval and post-metamorphic sea lampreys. Finally, toxicity tests indicated that larval sea lamprey with greater mass and condition factor (CF) were able to survive exposure to TFM longer than smaller sea lampreys. Collectively, these results suggest that large larval sea lampreys may be more tolerant to TFM, suggesting that streams containing high densities of large larvae may be at risk for increased residual sea lamprey following TFM treatment. Thus, it would be advisable to take precautions to reduce the chances of residuals when TFM is applied tosteams with high densities of large larvae...|$|R
40|$|The first {{specimen}} of Ammocoetes branchialis that showed histologically any atrophic {{changes in the}} endostyle was taken on July 16. These changes proceeded relatively rapidly for about a month, after which the endostyle as such was no longer recognized. All specimens examined after August 15 showed in cross section the characteristic ductless follicles more or less completely formed. More gradual and minor {{changes in the way}} of further absorption of cell remnants and completion of the follicles continued at least until September 1. Two specimens taken from the creek on September 4, 1911. showed complete follicle formation with some stainable colloid (figures 14 and 15). There was still yellow granular pigment in the fibrous tissue between the follicles. In two specimens taken on October 14, 1909, the pigment was absent and the follicles were more closely set, larger, and contained homogenous colloid. In the twenty-four specimens of ammocoetes studied, there were variations in the time of the onset of metamorphosis. There may also be variations in the rate of progress of the changes in different specimens. There is no evidence that removal of the animals from their native environment to the laboratory either increases or decreases the rate of metamorphosis. Schneider states that he was unable to get specimens kept in the laboratory to undergo metamorphosis. Gage, however, has repeatedly observed the metamorphosis under laboratory conditions, and the six of our specimens kept in the laboratory—some for forty days—remained in excellent condition and the metamorphosis proceeded as well as in those living in the creek. I know of no observations bearing on the question as to whether the metamorphosis may be hastened or delayed as it can be in tadpoles and other amphibia. It is probable, however, that physical conditions greatly influence the transformation. These observations as to the length of time from the inception to the completion of metamorphosis indicate that a month and probably longer is necessary for the <b>lake</b> and brook <b>lampreys</b> of Central New York. This is in agreement with the observations of Gage and of Muller on metamorphosis in general, but is at variance with the views of Bujor, who states that the process takes place within three to four days. The first endostylar changes are a gradual shrinkage in the whole organ with thickening of the capsule and septum and proliferation of the connective tissue in the periendostylar zone. The tongue anlage is developed in this thickening just dorsal to the endostyle and anterior to the gland orifice. The size of the chambers progressively decreases and with the thickening of the septum the halves of the endostyle are both absolutely and relatively more separated. All the five types of epithelia are affected, the first to show the change being type I, the four fan-shaped bundles of cuneiform cells of each half of the endostyle. These disappear totally quite early. The next type to show marked changes is type III, or the cells with yellow pigment granules. Here the change is progressive and these cell groups in different stages of atrophy may be traced through to the fully developed follicles. The epithelium of type V, or the endothelial-like lining of the parietal walls of the chambers, is piled up and extruded laterally as the chambers contract or shrink. These cells in different stages of atrophy may be followed until the metamorphosis is nearing completion. It is certain that the cells of types I, III, and V play no part {{in the formation of the}} ductless follicles. With types II and IV the question is not so easily settled as it is from one or the other or from both of these types that the permanent follicles arise. One can say definitely that type IV plays the major role, but whether the cells of type II after fusion with the basal group of type IV do not also share in the formation of the ventral follicle of the given chamber, I cannot decide, but from the evidence obtainable this seems probable. It is significant that the cells of type IV are continuous with, and indistinguishable from, the cells lining the orifice and are continued anteriorly in the deep pharyngeal groove and peripharyngeal grooves as well as posteriorally from the orifice in the small pharyngeal groove. As to the fate of this extraglandular epithelium of type IV I have no data save that with the closing of the orifice and the formation of the permanent branchial sac these grooves with their ciliated epithelium disappear and the whole sac comes to be lined with plain stratified epithelium. The fact that the cells of the pharyngeal grooves and the lining cells of the gland orifice are continuous with the cells of the endostyle from which the permanent thyroid follicles are formed is not without significance in relation to the development of the thyroid of the higher chordates. One or more very large follicles are formed from the lower portion of this orificial epithelium of type IV. Four ductless follicles are the maximum number that may be formed primarily in each half of the endostyle from the four areas of epithelium of type IV. From the specimens studied this maximum is frequently not obtained. Posterior to the orifice where four chambers exist, each corresponding to one half of an anterior chamber, but two follicles may be formed from each chamber, but in the coil these are proportionately increased, in cross section. Most of the detailed studies here recorded have been made on the part of the endostyle posterior to the coil where the simplest conditions exist. Here two follicles are ordinarily formed from each chamber. In cross sections the follicles are at first only long tubules whose cavities are the remnants of the original endostyle chambers, but when the metamorphosis is completed each of these primary tubules is cut up into several elongated closed sacs corresponding to the true ductless follicles of all higher chordates. New follicles also arise by budding from these primary ones, and this process is probably of normal occurrence at the metamorphosis...|$|R
