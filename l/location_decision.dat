The nature and behavior of markets depends somewhat on their locations therefore market performance partly depends on geography.. If a firm locates in a geographically isolated region, their market performance will be different than a firm located in a concentrated region. The location decisions of both firms and households create cities that differ in size and economic structure. When industries cluster, like in the Silicon Valley in California, they create urban areas with dominant firms and distinct economies.|$|E

This paper investigates what the role of talent is, when firms decide for a location by carrying out two studies. Firstly, an extensive literature review was conducted where three factors of firm <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> were identified as: clustering, soft and hard factors, and personal networks. The role of talent continuously emerged in the literature {{in regards to the}} three firm <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> factors and appeared to be intertwined in these. Consequently, these factors and the role of talent were conceptualized in an analytical framework. Thereafter, the analytical framework was applied to the second study when conducting a multiple-case study of three clean-tech firms in Uppsala, Sweden. This was done in order to investigate the role of talent in the firms’ <b>location</b> <b>decision.</b> The findings of the multiple-case study revealed that the role of talent was important during the <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> of all three firms where talent was intertwined with the identified location factors. Thus, the multiple-case study confirms that the role of talent impacts firm <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> through being intertwined in the identified firm <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> factors...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze the impact of tax rates and {{agglomeration}} rents – and more in particular their interaction - on <b>location</b> <b>decisions</b> of firms within Belgium. In the literature it is argued that both location determinants may enhance or rather weaken each other’s impact. Using the number of new firms at the sector level for 43 Belgian districts, we show that local effective tax rates either have no or a negative impact on <b>location</b> <b>decisions.</b> Before the Belgian corporate tax reform in 2003, demand-side induced agglomeration rents – market potential- have a positive impact on <b>location</b> <b>decisions.</b> Supply-side induced agglomeration rents - in terms of the number of existing firms – only increase entry within the same sector. However, the interaction effect between taxes and agglomeration rents on firm entry is significant.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the <b>location</b> <b>decisions</b> of family physicians in Saskatchewan by determining {{the factors that influence}} family physicians’ <b>location</b> <b>decisions,</b> and identifying the major themes from the factors. The research employed a rational choice model as a basis to design the methodology and explain how Saskatchewan family physicians make their practice <b>location</b> and re-location <b>decisions.</b> A mixed method approach, including an on-line questionnaire survey and interviews with key health agencies, was used to collect and analyse data. Data from the survey were summarised using summary statistics and cross tabulation. Responses from stakeholder interviews were transcribed and analyzed using interpretive description method. The mixed method approach elicited a rich and detailed description of family physicians’ <b>location</b> <b>decisions.</b> Participants of the study ranked family concern, work-life balance and community influence as the most influential factors of family physicians’ <b>location</b> <b>decisions.</b> The fourth factor of <b>locations</b> <b>decisions</b> according the study was compensation. Although compensation was mentioned as a factor, it was recorded as the least influential factor among the participants of this research. Other factors that were identified as having some influence on practice location choices were respect and appreciation, and scope of practice. To conclude, the study found that <b>location</b> <b>decisions</b> are not only about identifying the major influential factors of practice location choices, but also involve finding a good match between family physicians and potential practice locations and communities. That is, family physicians’ preferences must match the characteristics of the potential communities. Based on the conclusion, the study made two policy recommendations regarding the matching between family physicians and communities. The first policy recommendation is strategic matching between family physicians and communities for more efficient and effective recruitment and retention. The second recommendation is providing strategic incentives to ensure access to family physician services for the population in communities that do not meet the requirements of the strategic matching...|$|R

Previous literature identifies four main types of location factors that influence the distribution of new FDI manufacturing projects in the host country. These include regional demand, regional production costs, regional policies and regional presence of agglomeration economies. The empirical results suggest that certain non-agglomeration characteristics influence the <b>location</b> <b>decision</b> of Japanese firms in automotive-related industries.

As a tax measure, we employ the Tax Attractiveness Index (see Keller and Schanz 2013). This index covers 18 different tax factors, such as the taxation of dividends and capital gains, withholding taxes, the existence of a group taxation regime, and thin capitalization rules. Our count data regression analysis is based on a novel hand-collected data set consisting of the subsidiaries of German DAX 30 companies. Controlling for non-tax effects, we find that a country's tax environment as measured by the Tax Attractiveness Index has a significantly positive effect on the number of Germancontrolled subsidiaries located there. Hence, our study implies that <b>location</b> <b>decisions</b> depend on a bundle of tax factors as captured by the index. In a second step, we show that the <b>location</b> <b>decisions</b> of German DAX 30 companies cannot be explained by the statutory tax rate alone. In contrast, withholding taxes, double treaty networks, and special holding regimes seem to play a decisive role in <b>location</b> <b>decisions.</b> Previous studies examining only the influence of statutory tax rates may thus have underestimated the effects of taxation on the activities of multinational companies...|$|R
