40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the antitumor agent 6 -thioguanine (TG, NSC- 752) by rat liver was {{studied in}} vitro. Livers from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized and the 2 ̆ 2 liver homogenate 2 ̆ 2 {{was subjected to}} differential centrifugation to obtain the 2 ̆ 210, 000 x g pellet 2 ̆ 2, the 2 ̆ 2 post-mitochondrial fraction 2 ̆ 2, the 2 ̆ 2 cytosol fraction 2 ̆ 2, and the 2 ̆ 2 microsomes 2 ̆ 2. The homogenity of each fraction was estimated by appropriate marker enzyme assays. To delineate the in vitro metabolism of TG by rat <b>liver,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> mM of 8 -(2 ̆ 714) CTG was incubated with different subcellular fractions in KCl-Tris-MgCl(, 2) buffer, pH 7. 4 at 37 (DEGREES). The metabolites formed were identified by chromatography, UV spectrometry, as well as mass spectrometry. After a 1 hr incubation, TG was metabolized by the liver homogenate, the 10, 000 x g pellet and the post-mitochondrial fraction mainly to 6 -thioguanosine (TGR), accompanied by varying lesser amounts of 6 -thiouric acid (TUA), allantoin, guanine- 6 -sulfinic acid (G-SO(, 2) H) and an unknown product. In comparison, the cytosal fraction converted TG almost entirely to TGR and TUA in equal amounts. The formation of TGR from TG was limited by the endogenous supply of ribose- 1 -phosphate. With the microsomal fraction, however, TG was metabolized significantly to G-SO(, 2) H and the unknown, accompanied with some TGR. After a 5 hr incubation the metabolism of TG was changed to favor the catabolic route, yielding mostly TUA in the post-mitochondrial and cytosol fractions; but mainly allantoin in the liver homogenate fraction. The kinetic studies of TG metabolism by the subcellar fractions indicated that the formation of TGR served as a depot form of TG. The level of TGR decreased when the catabolism of TG became prominent. The oxidation of TG to GSO(, 2) H mediated by the hepatic microsomes represented a new catabolic pathway of TG. This GSO(, 2) H, under acidic conditions, readily decomposes to guanine and inorganic sulfate. In the presence of reduced glutathione in Tris buffer, pH 7. 8 at 25 (DEGREES), GSO(, 2) H is adducted to glutathione chemically to form S-(2 -amino-purin- 6 -yl) glutathione and conceivably, inorganic sulfate. Therefore, the formation of GSO(, 2) H from TG might have implication in the desulfuration mechanism of TG. On the other hand, the unknown formed from TG {{by the action of}} the microsomal enzymes appeared to be a TG conjugate. However, it is neither a glutathione, a glucuronide, nor a ribose conjugate. Additionally, the deamination of TG by guanine deaminase (E. C. 3. 5. 4. 3) isolated from rat liver was also investigated. TG is a poorer substrate (Km = 4. 8 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 3) M) for guanine deaminase than that of guanine (Km = 4. 7 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 6) M) at pH 7. 25, optimal pH for TG as a substrate. TG is also a competitive inhibitor of guanine for guanine deaminase, with a ki of 2. 2 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 4) M. ...|$|E

40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{have been}} implicated in the hepatic injury induced after cold ischemia-warm reperfusion (CI-WR), by {{altering}} the extracellular matrix (ECM), but their precise role remains unknown. The hepatic MMP expression was evaluated after 2 conditions of CI (4 degrees C for 24 and 42 hours: viable and nonviable livers) followed by different periods of WR, using isolated perfused rat livers. CI-WR induced moderate changes in hepatic MMP transcript levels not influenced by CI duration, whereas gelatinase activities accumulated in liver effluents. Therefore, the protective effect of a new phosphinic MMP inhibitor, RXP 409, was tested after prolonged CI. RXP 409 (10 microM) {{was added to the}} University of Wisconsin solution, and livers were preserved for 42 hours (4 degrees C), then reperfused for 1 hour in Krebs solution (37 degrees C), containing 20 % erythrocytes. Liver viability parameters were recorded, and the extent of cell necrosis was evaluated on liver biopsies, using trypan blue nuclear uptake. Treatment with RXP 409 significantly improved liver function (transaminase release and bile secretion) and liver injury. In particular, the MMP inhibitor significantly modified the extent of cell death from large clusters of necrotic hepatocytes as found in control livers (2 %- 60 % of liver biopsies; mean, 26 % +/- 9 %) to isolated necrotic hepatocytes as found in treated <b>livers</b> (<b>0.</b> <b>2</b> %- 12 %; mean, 3 % +/- 2 %) (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that MMPs, by altering the ECM, {{play a major role in}} liver CI-WR injury leading to extensive hepatocyte necrosis and that their inhibition might prove to be a new strategy in improving preservation solutions...|$|R

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 114 - 114. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 242 In the {{pet food}} industry, Salmonella is getting greater scrutiny {{because it is}} considered a “reasonably foreseeable hazard” {{with the implementation of}} the Food Safety Modernization Act. Specifically, there is zero tolerance for any serotype of Salmonella in pet foods. Salmonella contamination was responsible for 78 % of the Class I recalls in pet food {{according to the most recent}} Reportable Food Registry Report (FDA, 2015). One potential method of Salmonella mitigation shown to be effective was through coating the exterior of the kibble with a powdered dry acidulant, such as sodium bisulfate (SBS; Jones-Hamilton, Co.). Sodium bisulfate coating on both dog and cat kibbles was shown to provide complete mitigation of Salmonella within 14 -d storage (Jeffrey et al., 2014). However, it is thought that the use of dry acidulant with a palatant for coating kibble may negatively impact palatability of a dry dog food. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine if the use of a dry acidulant, SBS, would influence the palatability of a dry dog food. A single dry extruded all life stages dog food was collected from a commercial pet food manufacturer before the coating step. The kibble was coated with either 2. 2 % spray dried chicken <b>liver</b> + <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % SBS or 2. 2 % spray dried chicken <b>liver</b> + <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % powdered silica (control). A total of 20 beagles were used in a standard 2 -bowl forced choice palatability test method for 2 d. Dogs were fed 400 g of both diets once per day, with bowls rotated daily to address side bias. Results were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (Cary, NC). The inclusion of SBS did not affect daily preference of diet (P = 0. 23). Furthermore, there was no effect of day (P = 0. 18) or the interaction of treatment × day (P = 0. 98). These results demonstrate that palatability is not affected by the inclusion of SBS with a palatant in the coating of dog food kibble. Considering that the inclusion of SBS has been shown to be effective at mitigating Salmonella in pet food and no negative effects on palatability were observed, the use of a dry acidulant in a dog food coating gives the industry a promising method to control Salmonella contamination of finished dog foods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract I Mirtazapine {{is a new}} {{antidepressant}} agent hat {{entered the}} United States market in April 1996. To date, the literature provides limited information about therapeutic blood concentrations and virtually no information about postmortem l vels. The Los Angeles County Coroner's Toxicology Laboratory has encountered 13 cases where postmortem tissue distributions of mirtazapine were determined. The analysis of mirtazapine from postmortem specimens (2 -mL sample size) consisted of an n-butylchloride basic extraction procedure with identification and quantitation on a gas chromatograph-nitrogen-phosphorus detector. Linearity was achieved from 0. 025 mg/L to 3. 0 mg/t with a limit of quantitation of 0. 025 mg/L. Confirmation of mirtazapine was performed on a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer by comparison with a pure analytical standard. The tissue distribution of mirtazapine are in the following concentration ranges: heart blood 0. 03 - 0. 57 mg/L (13 cases), femoral blood 0. 04 - 0. 24 mg/L (9 cases), vitreous 0. 06 - 0. 10 mg/L (3 cases), <b>liver</b> <b>0.</b> 32 - <b>2.</b> 1 mg/kg (12 cases), bile 0. 40 - 6. 6 mg/L (7 cases), urine <b>0.</b> 12 - <b>2.</b> 5 rag//(11 cases), kidney 0. 23 mg/kg (1 case), spleen 0. 17 mg/kg (1 case), and gastric <b>0.</b> 001 - <b>2.</b> 7 mg total (9 cases).

The basis of all studies was the „membranes as pacemakers of metabolism” by Hulbert (Lipids, 2007, 42, 811 - 819).

40|$|The {{results suggest}} that {{nicotine}} vapour stimulates an in vitro olfactory preparation in three strains of rat and two strains of mouse, {{in a manner similar}} to known odorants. Preliminary experiments also suggest that nicotine is an odorant for human subjects. In the rat, the electro-olfactogram (EOG) produced by nicotine is attenuated by superfusion of the olfactory mucosa with the lectin concanavalin A. This reduction is prevented by a-methyl-D-mannoside, suggesting. that there is a glyco-moiety associated with at least one olfactory receptor responding to nicotine. A concanavalin A induced change in EOG response with varying odorant concentration for several odorants, including nicotine, can be explained by a single concanavalin A sensitive olfactory receptor with a dissociation constant for odorant binding in the order of 100 nM. The results also show that hydrophilic odorants are poor stimulants for the olfactory epithelium, supporting the hypothesis that the interaction of an odorant with the olfactory receptors involves hydrophobic effects. Spatial variation in response to four odorants, including nicotine, by the rat olfactory epithelium can be explained by a mosaic of olfactory receptors of various types in the olfactory epithelium. This observation is consistent with current hypotheses of odour quality determination by the olfactory mucosa. Nicotine binding sites in olfactory and respiratory epithelia. Binding studies show that there are sites for 3 H(-) nicotine in both olfactory and respiratory preparations, though these sites may not be the same in each tissue. The binding parameters for olfactory epithelium are Ko= 695 nM and Bmax= 8. 24 pmol/mg protein (mean of two experiments at optimal binding conditions).

40|$|In {{conditions}} {{associated with}} high serum iodothyronine sulfate concentrations, e. g. during fetal development, desulfation of these conjugates may be important in the regulation of thyroid hormone homeostasis. However, {{little is known about}} which sulfatases are involved in this process. Therefore, we investigated the hydrolysis of iodothyronine sulfates by homogenates of V 79 cells expressing the human arylsulfatases A (ARSA), B (ARSB), or C (ARSC; steroid sulfatase), as well as tissue fractions of human and rat liver and placenta. We found that only the microsomal fraction from liver and placenta hydrolyzed iodothyronine sulfates. Among the recombinant enzymes only the endoplasmic reticulum-associated ARSC showed activity toward iodothyronine sulfates; the soluble lysosomal ARSA and ARSB were inactive. Recombinant ARSC as well as human placenta microsomes hydrolyzed iodothyronine sulfates with a substrate preference for 3, 3 '-diiodothyronine sulfate (3, 3 '-T(2) S) approximately T(3) sulfate (T(3) S) >> rT(3) S approximately T(4) S, whereas human and rat liver microsomes showed a preference for 3, 3 '-T(2) S > T(3) S >> rT(3) S approximately T(4) S. ARSC and the tissue microsomal sulfatases were all characterized by high apparent K(m) values (> 50 microM) for 3, 3 '-T(2) S and T(3) S. Iodothyronine sulfatase activity determined using 3, 3 '-T(2) S as a substrate was much higher in human liver microsomes than in human placenta microsomes, although ARSC is expressed at higher levels in human placenta than in human liver. The ratio of estrone sulfate to T(2) S hydrolysis in human <b>liver</b> microsomes (<b>0.</b> <b>2)</b> differed largely from that in ARSC homogenate (80) and human placenta microsomes (150).

Further research is needed to identify these iodothyronine sulfatases, and to study the physiological importance of the reversible sulfation of iodothyronines in thyroid hormone metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Vomiting in {{pregnancy}} {{is a common}} condition affecting 80 % of pregnant women. Hyperemesis is {{at one end of}} the spectrum, seen in <b>0.</b> 5 – <b>2</b> % of the pregnant population. Known factors such as nulliparity, younger age and high body mass indexare associated with an increased risk of this condition in the first trimester. Late pregnancy complications attributable to hyperemesis, the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood, have not been studied in large population-based studies in the United Kingdom. The objective of this study was to determine a plausible association between hyperemesis and pregnancy complications,such as pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes and liver problems {{in pregnancy}}, and the rates of elective (ElCS) and emergency caesarean section (EmCS). Methods: Using a database based on ICD- 10 classification, anonymised data of admissions to a large multi-ethnic hospital in Manchester, UK between 2000 and 2012 were examined. Notwithstanding the obvious limitations with hospital database-based research, this large volume of datasets allows powerful studies of disease trends and complications. Results Between 2000 and 2012, 156 507 women aged 45 or under were admitted to hospital. Of these, 1111 women were coded for hyperemesis (0. 4 %). A greater proportion of women with hyperemesis than without hyperemesis were coded forhypertensive disorders in pregnancy such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (2. 7 % vs 1. 5 %;P= 0. 001). The proportion of gestational diabetes and liver disorders in pregnancy was similar for both groups (diabetes: 0. 5 % vs. 0. 4 %; P= <b>0.</b> 945, <b>liver</b> disorders: <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % vs. <b>0.</b> 1 %;P= 0. 662). Hyperemesis patients had a higher proportion of elective and emergency caesarean sections compared with the non-hyperemesis group (ElCS: 3. 3 % vs. <b>2</b> %; P= <b>0.</b> 002, EmCS: 5 % vs. 3 %; P= 0. 00). Conclusions: There was a higher rate of emergency and elective caesarean section in women with hyperemesis, which could reflect the higher prevalence of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders(but not diabetes or liver disorders) in this group. The factors contributing to the higher prevalence of hypertensive disorders arenot known, but these findings lead us to question whether there is a similar pathogenesis in the development of both the conditions and hence whether further study in this area is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Neonatal {{injection}} of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV 8) vectors results in widespread transduction in multiple organs and therefore holds promise in neonatal gene therapy. On the other hand, insertional mutagenesis causing liver cancer has {{been implicated in}} rAAV-mediated neonatal gene transfer. Here, to better understand rAAV integration in neonatal livers, we investigated the frequency and spectrum of genomic integration of rAAV 8 vectors in the liver following intraperitoneal {{injection of}} <b>2.</b> <b>0</b> × 1011 vector genomes at birth. This dose was sufficient to transduce a majority of hepatocytes in the neonatal period. In the first approach, we injected mice with a β-galactosidase-expressing vector at birth and quantified rAAV integration events {{by taking advantage of}} liver regeneration in a chronic hepatitis animal model and following partial hepatectomy. In the second approach, we performed a new, quantitative rAAV vector genome rescue assay by which we identified rAAV integration sites and quantified integrations. As a result, we find that at least ∼ 0. 05 % of hepatocytes contained rAAV integration, while the average copy number of integrated double-stranded vector genome per cell in the <b>liver</b> was ∼ <b>0.</b> <b>2,</b> suggesting concatemer integration. Twenty-three of 34 integrations (68 %) occurred in genes, but none of them were near the mir- 341 locus, the common rAAV integration site found in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, rAAV 8 vector integration occurs preferentially in genes at a frequency of 1 in approximately 103 hepatocytes when a majority of hepatocytes are once transduced in the neonatal period. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the relationship between vector dose and integration frequency or spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed at}} {{adopting}} the developmental {{changes in the}} internal organs and bilateral traits of growing chickens selected five generations for increased 6 -week body weight and genotyping for normal feathering (line F) or naked-necks (line N), compared to their corresponding genetic controls (lines CF and CN). Line N had the smallest weight percentages of total lungs and <b>liver</b> (<b>0.</b> 54 and <b>2.</b> 38 %) and biggest weight percentages of right and left shanks (2. 46 and 2. 48 %). Line F had the smallest spleen weight percentage (0. 20 %) and tallest right and left shanks (8. 50 and 8. 57 cm) and widest right and left shanks (3. 74 and 3. 75 cm). Gizzard weight percentages of lines N and CN (3. 37 and 3. 55 %) were significantly more than those of lines F and CF (2. 74 and 3. 00 %). The results indicated that neither short-term selection nor Na allele have influenced the development of heart. Na allele showed variable pleiotropic effects, where the weight percentages of lungs and liver were decreased and the weight percentages of gizzard and spleen were increased. A reduction in lung and liver weight percentages characterized the naked-neck selected line, revealing an interaction between selection and Na allele. The pressure of short-term selection for body weight was early noticeable {{on the development of}} liver and spleen that could initiate possible metabolic disorders or susceptibility to disease infection later with the continuity of selection scheme. Short-term selection albeit boosted the bilateral shank measurements, but did not influence the bilateral developmental stability. The developmental stability characterized the bilateral characters in chickens carrying Na allele, suggesting a role of Na allele in the developmental stability of the birds pertaining the natural heating waves. The results of correlation coefficients indicated that the bilateral asymmetries of different characters are not significantly associated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} was {{designed}} to characterize pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of nebicapone in rats and mice. Upon oral administration of nebicapone the extent of mouse liver catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition is half that in the rat. Nebicapone was rapidly absorbed reaching plasma C within 30 min and being completely eliminated by 8 h. Nebicapone was metabolized mainly by glucuronidation and methylation in both species, but rat had an extra major metabolite, resulting from sulphation. Administration of nebicapone by the intraperitoneal route significantly increased compound AUC in the rat while in the mouse a significant increase in AUC of metabolites was observed. These results show that nebicapone exhibited marked species differences in bioavailability and metabolic profile. Evaluation of COMT activity in rat and mice liver homogenates revealed that both had similar methylation efficiencies (K values, respectively 7. 3 and 6. 4 min), but rat had twice active enzyme units as the mouse (molar equivalency respectively 150 and 83). Furthermore, nebicapone inhibited rat liver COMT with a lower K than mouse <b>liver</b> COMT (respectively <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> versus 1. 2 nM). In conclusion, the results from the present study show that mice and rats respond differently to COMT inhibition by nebicapone. The more pronounced inhibitory effects of nebicapone in the rat may be related to an enhanced oral availability and less pronounced metabolism of nebicapone in this specie, but also concerned with the predominant expression of S-COMT over MB-COMT, the latter of which is less sensitive to inhibition by nebicapone than the former...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of single cell proteins (Kluyveromyces marxianus) as fishmeal substitutes for Oreochromis niloticus during long-term feeding under natural climatic conditions. Juveniles (150) were divided into two groups: the control group, fed with conventional fish diet (T 1); and the experimental group, fed with the alternative diet (T 2). T 1 animals had a higher final weight and per cent weight gain than T 2 animals, which we mainly observed in winter and autumn. The lipid content ranged from 1. 9 % to 3. 8 % in <b>liver</b> and from <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> % to 1 % in white muscle for both groups. T 2 animals had a higher protein concentration in the fillet and the lipid content in this tissue was not altered by diet.

Specific fatty acids (FAs) were selectively retained in fillet phospholipids (PLs), primarily as C 22 : 6 n 3, which was found at high levels in the PLs of both groups during all seasons. Despite the differences observed, the percentage of polyunsaturated FAs in the fillet was similar throughout the experiment for both diets, reaching approximately 50 % of the total FA in the PLs.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom received an application from BASF {{to modify the}} existing MRLs for fenpropimorph in commodities of animal origin {{as a result of}} the reported use on wheat, barely, rye and oats. The United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRLs in tissues of swine and ruminant origin and in milk. In {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 an Evaluation Report was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. EFSA concluded that the data confirm the MRL of 0. 5 mg/kg for the reported use on barley and oats; for wheat and rye a lower MRL of 0. 15 mg/kg would be sufficient. For food of animal origin EFSA derived the following MRL proposals: 3 mg/kg (ruminant <b>liver),</b> <b>0.</b> 5 mg/kg (ruminant kidney), <b>0.</b> <b>2</b> mg/kg (ruminant fat), 0. 15 mg/kg (ruminant muscle), 0. 03 mg/kg (swine <b>liver),</b> <b>0.</b> 015 mg/kg (milk) and the LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg (swine muscle, fat, kidney). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of fenpropimorph in the commodities under consideration. The exposure resulting from the fenpropimorph uses on cereals and the derived MRLs on products of animal origin will not result in an acute consumer health risk. A potential long-term consumer risk could not be excluded for fenpropimorph, with wheat being the major contributor. The overall long-term exposure is significantly reduced if the MRLs on wheat and rye are lowered to the value of 0. 15 mg/kg supported in the current application. However, the long-term risk assessment could not be finalised due to lack of information on the full details on all authorised uses and the scientific basis for the existing MRLs...|$|R
