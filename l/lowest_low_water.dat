50|$|Like other {{estuaries}} {{along the}} Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences semi-diurnal tides (two high tides and two <b>low</b> tides per day). At mean <b>low</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (the lower <b>low</b> tide), the bay contains approximately 113 million cubic ft of water. Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's tidal prism is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 - 9 feet), which can vary {{the amount of}} water (40-90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean tidal period of 745 minutes, bay waters turn over, on average, twice a day. Mixing within the estuary is dependent on local winds and tides. Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary. This has been further corroborated by water quality and dye studies.|$|R

40|$|AIM: In {{this paper}} we {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} flooding (<b>low</b> and high <b>water</b> period) on the feeding activity and diet composition of Serrapinus notomelas in patches of the macrophyte Eichhornia azurea in a shallow floodplain lake (upper Paraná River Floodplain, Brazil). We also assessed the variations of diet composition and feeding activity along the diel cycle. METHODS: Traps were used to catch the fish inside of macrophyte patches monthly from June/ 2007 to May/ 2008. A total of 1038 stomachs were examined. We assessed the feeding activity with the mean stomach fullness degree method. To summarize and support the results of diet composition in the different periods (<b>low</b> and high <b>water</b> periods) and times (dawn, light period, and dusk), was applied a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS). RESULTS: The feeding activity of S. notomelas did not differ between <b>low</b> and high <b>water</b> periods, but it differed along the diel cycle. The feeding activity was higher during the light period and dusk, at both the <b>low</b> and high <b>water</b> period. The diet composition differed significantly between <b>low</b> and high <b>water</b> periods, and also along the diel cycle. In the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> the diet of S. notomelas was composed mainly by algae and in the high water by Cladocera. Algae were consumed mainly during the light period while Cladocera in dawn and dusk. CONCLUSIONS: Our {{results indicate that the}} oscillations in the water level affect the diet composition, but not the feeding activity of S. notomelas.

Post treatment of biomass pyrolysis vapor was investigated in a catalyst fixed bed reactor at the downstream of the pyrolysis reactor. In-situ catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapor was conducted in an entrained flow pyrolysis reactor by feeding a premixed feedstock of the catalyst and biomass. Na 2 CO 3 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 was very effective for de-oxygenation of the pyrolysis liquid and oxygen content of the bio-oil was decreased from 47. 5 wt. % to 16. 4 wt. %. An organic rich bio-oil was obtained with 5. 8 wt. % water content and a higher heating value of 36. 1 MJ/kg. Carboxylic acids were completely removed and the bio-oil had almost a neutral pH. This bio-oil of high calorific <b>low,</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> and oxygen content may be an attractive fuel precursor.
