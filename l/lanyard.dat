5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red <b>lanyard</b> worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Type 94 Nambu pistols {{decreased}} {{towards the end}} of World War II as the Japanese faced bombing raids from allied forces and material shortages increased. This drastic change in quality from late March 1945, onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear {{towards the end of}} June 1945. The smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a bakelite checkered pattern. Many pistols were not serialized and no pistols have been reported that bear July 1945 manufacture date. Only four unserialized and undated pistols are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks, <b>lanyard</b> loops, and extractors. A small number of pistols made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded pistols that had minor or cosmetic defects.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a <b>lanyard</b> within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Many ID card <b>lanyards</b> have a {{built-in}} feature {{known as a}} [...] "breakaway" [...] closure. Breakaway <b>lanyards</b> release when pulled or when pressure is applied. This prevents choking or hanging. <b>Lanyards</b> with a breakaway feature are most often used in hospitals and healthcare clinics, schools, nursing homes, child care facilities, or factories that require employees to operate machinery.|$|R

50|$|Some accoutrements such as <b>lanyards,</b> {{have both}} a traditional/ceremonial and a {{practical}} purpose. In these cases a different item may be worn in garrison or ceremonial occasions than that {{used in the}} field. For example, in the Australian army different corps and units wear different coloured <b>lanyards</b> for service or ceremonial dress, but universally use drab natural fibre coloured <b>lanyards</b> for pistol retention in the field.|$|R
25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a <b>lanyard</b> pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple <b>lanyard</b> pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The <b>lanyard</b> pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to fire charges against {{submerged}} targets was with aircraft bombs attached to <b>lanyards</b> which triggered them. A similar idea was a 16 lb guncotton charge in a <b>lanyarded</b> can. Two of these lashed together {{became known as the}} [...] "depth charge Type A". Problems with the <b>lanyards</b> tangling and failing to function {{led to the development of}} a chemical pellet trigger as the [...] "Type B". These were effective at a distance of around 20 ft.|$|R

25|$|Grandpa Type A Nambus have {{multiple}} variances from the later Type A Modified. The Type A Modified, {{commonly referred to}} as Papa Nambu, were produced at the Tokyo Arsenal until the 7000 serial number range. The trigger guard of the Grandpa Type A Nambu were considered extremely cramped especially when wearing gloves and were enlarged in later produced models. The Grandpa Nambus also had a wooden bottom magazine and welded <b>lanyard</b> loops. Papa Nambus had aluminum bottomed magazines with <b>lanyard</b> loops retained in rings. Both the Grandpa and Papa type Nambus may have the Siamese juk symbol stamped on the rear grip indicating service in Thailand before World War II.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a {{comeback}} to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, {{in part to}} coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary {{since its founding in}} 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle <b>lanyard</b> in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The <b>lanyard</b> was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.|$|E

25|$|The Sparoair I was the {{original}} version of the rocket, launched using an ejection system and a <b>lanyard</b> for firing; after that proved unreliable in flight testing, the Sparoair II was developed that utilised a rail launch with ignition prior to release from the aircraft. Eight launches of Sparoair II vehicles had been conducted by 1961. Each Sparoair II rocket cost USD$6,000.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{propellant}} charge {{appropriate for}} the required range and the bomb were loaded via the muzzle. Usually a Lee–Enfield rifle's bolt action mechanism was screwed into the breech.
