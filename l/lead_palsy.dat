40|$|Introduction: Unilateral {{anterior}} shoulder dislocation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common problems encountered in orthopedic practice. However, simultaneous bilateral anterior dislocation of the shoulders is quite rare. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 75 -year-old woman presented with simultaneous bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation following a trauma, complicated with a traction injury to the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

30|$|Surgical {{intervention}} in idiopathic or acquired {{superior oblique muscle}} palsy is not necessarily applied to all cases of the palsy. The clinical manifestations, especially diplopia or the large extent of abnormal head posture, lead to surgical intervention. Even among patients with idiopathic or acquired palsies who undergo surgeries, the clinical presentations, such as vertical deviations and vertical fusion amplitudes, vary largely from patient to patient. A large range of vertical fusion amplitudes in the idiopathic palsy, varying from patient to patient, will give unpredictable surgical outcome while a small range of vertical fusion amplitudes in the acquired <b>palsy</b> <b>leads</b> to the need of more precise surgery. Ideally, the surgery should be finished in a single secession, but an additional surgery will be sometimes required. The combination of two surgical procedures at a single secession is a recommended choice, but is difficult {{to be followed by}} non-subspecialty ophthalmologists.|$|R
40|$|Lower eyelid {{position}} {{is determined by}} the re-lationship of the globe to the bony orbit, 1 the balance between gravity and tissue elasticity, the support of the medial and lateral canthal liga-ments, and the dynamic support of the orbicularis oculi muscle. In this system, the deep lateral canthal tendon plays a key role. 2 – 4 It inserts inside the orbit at the lateral orbital tubercle (Whitnall’s tubercle), 5 located 2 – 3 mm posterior to the orbital rim. During aging, tissue elasticity gradually decreases and the static support system elongates. So maintaining the lower eyelid against the ocular surface in elderly de-pends more and more on the orbicularis oculi mus-cle.

50|$|Neonatal Stroke, {{similar to}} a stroke which occurs in adults, {{is defined as a}} {{disturbance}} to the blood supply of the developing brain in the first 28 days of life. This description includes both ischemic events, which results from a blockage of vessels, and hypoxic events, which results from a lack of oxygen to the brain tissue, as well as some combination of the two. A neonatal stroke occurs in approximately 1 in 4000 births, but is likely much higher {{due to the lack of}} noticeable symptoms. One treatment with some proven benefits is hypothermia, but may be most beneficial in conjunction with pharmacological agents. Neonatal strokes may <b>lead</b> to cerebral <b>palsy,</b> learning difficulties, or other disabilities. Well-designed clinical trials for stroke treatment in neonates are lacking, but some current studies involve the transplantation of neural stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells; it is not yet known if this therapy is likely to be successful.|$|R
40|$|Trochlear nerve <b>palsy</b> <b>leads</b> to {{kinematic}} aberrations of {{both the}} paretic and the unaffected eye. During dynamic head roll, the rotation axis of the covered paretic or unaffected eye deviates inward, while the rotation axis of the viewing paretic or unaffected eye aligns with the line of sight; this convergence of rotation axes increases with gaze {{moving in the direction}} of the unaffected eye. During downward saccades, the trajectories of both eyes curve towards the unaffected side; these curvatures increase when the head is rolled to the affected side and gaze directed to the unaffected side. Hence, during both vestibular evoked and saccadic ocular movements, the unaffected eye shows similar kinematic aberrations as the paretic eye. While aberrations of the paretic eye can be explained by decreased force of the superior oblique (SO) muscle, aberrations of the unaffected eye may be due to increased force parallel to the paretic SO in the unaffected eye in accordance with Hering's law. This law, which forms the basis of conjugate eye movements, also seems to govern eye displacements in unilateral eye muscle palsy...|$|R
50|$|In {{infants with}} poor neurodevelopment, {{prematurity}} and asphyxia are typical problems. These conditions can <b>lead</b> to cerebral <b>palsy,</b> mental retardation, and sensory impairment. Hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy is a proven therapy for neonatal brain injury. However, {{recent research has}} demonstrated that high doses of recombinant erythropoietin can reduce or prevent this type of neonatal brain injury if administered early. A high rate of neuronal apoptosis is evident in the developing brain due to initial overproduction. Neurons that are electrically active and make synaptic connections survive, while those that do not undergo apoptosis. While this is a normal phenomenon, it is also known that neurons in the developing brain are at an increased risk to undergo apoptosis in response to injury. A small amount of the RhEpo can cross the blood-brain barrier and protect against hypoxic-ischemia injury. Epo treatment has also shown to preserve hemispheric brain volume 6 weeks after neonatal stroke. It demonstrated both neuroprotective effects and a direction towards neurogenesis in neonatal stroke without associated long-term difficulties.|$|R
40|$|Schwannoma {{is a type}} of benign nerve sheath tumour {{arising from}} the Schwann cell. Because of the close {{relationship}} between the tumour and the nerve of origin (NOO), the operation of extracranial head and neck schwannoma may <b>lead</b> to <b>palsy</b> of major nerve. For this reason, an accurate diagnosis of schwannoma with the identification of the NOO is crucial to the management. The aim of this review was to find out the distribution of the NOO and the usefulness of the investigations in the diagnosis of schwannoma. Medical records of the patients who underwent operation of the extracranial head and neck schwannoma in our division were reviewed. Between January 2000 and December 2009, 30 cases of extracranial head and neck schwannoma were operated. Sympathetic trunk (10, 33 %) and vagus nerve (6, 20 %) were the two most common NOOs. In five (17 %) cases, the NOO was not found to be arising from any major nerve. For these 30 patients, 20 received fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and 26 underwent imaging studies (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) before operation. The specificity of FNAC and imaging studies in making the diagnosis of schwannoma was 20 and 38 %, respectively. For the patients who had nerve palsies on presentation, their deficits remained after operation. The rate of nerve palsy after tumour excision with division of NOO and intracapsular enucleation was 100 and 67 %, respectively. The diagnosis of schwannoma is suggested by clinical features and supported by investigations. Most of the time, the diagnosis can only be confirmed on the histological study of the surgical specimen. Sympathetic trunk and vagus nerve are the two common NOOs. MRI is the investigation of choice in the diagnosis of schwannoma and the identification of NOO. © 2011 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transarterial balloon {{embolization}} {{used to be}} {{the preferred}} method for treating DCCFs; however, a strayed, overinflated, or migrated balloon may <b>lead</b> to oculomotor <b>palsy.</b> This investigation compared the use of detachable balloons and GDCs, which were previously used only in cases of balloon-technique failure and are now increasingly used as a first-line treatment for DCCFs, in terms of the risk of oculomotor nerve deficit, mortality/morbidity, and initial angiographic results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 48 patients with DCCFs treated with endovascular embolization at our institution between March 2004 and May 2009, 38 patients were included in this review. Patients who underwent trapping procedures, a second intervention within 2 weeks, or any procedure that included n-BCA infusion were excluded. Twenty of the enrolled patients were treated with transarterial balloons and the other 18, with GDCs. RESULTS: Five patients (25 %) in the balloon group and none in the coil group had oculomotor nerve deficits within 2 weeks. The rate of procedure-related oculomotor nerve deficit was significantly higher in the balloon group than in the coil group (P. 048). There {{were no significant differences in}} terms of procedure-related mortality/morbidity or initial angiographic results between the 2 groups...|$|R
40|$|White matter (WM) lesions in preterm newborns may <b>lead</b> to {{cerebral}} <b>palsy.</b> To study WM lesions in a mouse model, we used intrapallial stereotactic {{injections of}} ibotenic acid, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. Previous studies support a contribution of {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) to the brain lesions seen in various adult excitotoxic models. Therefore, we studied both 5 -day-old (P 5) wild-type mice and t-PA knock-out (t-PA-/-) mice. The ibotenic acid doses required to induce WM cysts were lower in the wild-type mice (EC 50 < 0. 01 microg/animal) than in the t-PA-/- mice (EC 50 = 2. 5 microg/animal) (p < 0. 01), indicating the existence of t-PA-dependent and t-PA-independent mechanisms. Dose-dependent prolonged cyst growth occurred in the wild-type mice only. Early microglial activation and astrogliosis were similar in the wild-type and t-PA-/- mice. In adult mice (P 45), demyelination occurred at the injection site in both groups but the astroglial scar was denser in the wild-type than in the t-PA-/- mice. These data support involvement of t-PA at several stages of WM lesion formation. Inactivation of t-PA might confer protection by prolonged hemostasis. The role of t-PA in cyst expansion suggests {{a new approach to}} the development of neuroprotective strategies in infants with developing WM lesions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Botulinum toxin is {{a natural}} purifi ed protein {{and one of the}} strongest {{biological}} poisons – neu-rotoxin. It is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Its medical usage started in USA in and in Europe in. Th ere are seven diff erent immune types of the toxin: A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Toxin types A and B are used to decrease muscular spasticity. Botulinum toxin prevents the formation of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve tissues in muscles, which in the end irreversibly destroys neuromuscular synapses. It is called temporary local chemoden-ervation. It does not aff ect the synthesis of acetylcholine. As it aff ects neuromuscular bond it also aff ects one of the symptoms of cerebral palsy- spasticity. Decreasing the spasticity of children with cerebral <b>palsy</b> <b>leads</b> to the improvement of conscious movements, muscles are less toned, passive mobility is improved, orthosis tolerance is also im-proved, and the child is enabled to perform easier and better motor functions such as crawling, standing and walking. Since the action of Botulinum toxin is limited to - months, new neural collaterals are formed and neuromuscular conductivity is reestablished which in the end once again develops a muscular spasm.

40|$|Transgenic mice {{expressing the}} human {{superoxide}} dismutase 1 (SOD- 1) mutant at position 93 (G 93 A) develop a phenotype resembling {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). In fact, G 93 A mice develop progressive motor deficits which finally <b>lead</b> to motor <b>palsy</b> and death. This {{is due to the}} progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Although a similar loss is reported for specific cranial motor nuclei, only a few studies so far investigated degeneration in a few brainstem nuclei. We recently reported that chronic lithium administration delays onset and duration of the disease, while reducing degeneration of spinal motor neuron. In the present study, we extended this investigation to all somatic motor nuclei of the brain stem in the G 93 A mice and we evaluated whether analogous protective effects induced by lithium in the spinal cord were present at the brain stem level. We found that all motor but the oculomotor nuclei were markedly degenerated in G 93 A mice, and chronic treatment with lithium significantly attenuated neurodegeneration in the trigeminal, facial, ambiguus, and hypoglossal nuclei. Moreover, in the hypoglossal nucleus, we found that recurrent collaterals were markedly lost in G 93 A mice while they were rescued by chronic lithium administration...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{it is well}} {{recognized}} that there are multiple potential pathways causing hypoxic-ischemic events that may <b>lead</b> to cerebral <b>palsy</b> in term infants. The {{signs and symptoms of}} neonatal encephalopathy may range from mild to severe, depending on nature and timing of brain injury. The incidence of cerebral palsy has not changed over the last 30 years and one of the obstetricians’challenge is how to recognize babies at intrapartum risk both before and during labour. A detailed description of prepartum and intrapartum risk factors is available. A close surveillance of labour and intrapartum time should be mandatory as the valuation of all available data from obstetrical examination, cardiotocography, ultrasound and labour progression to reach the correct diagnosis with the lowest possible rate of error. The close monitoring should not exclude a humanized and compliant attitude versus labouring women and their families. We analysed the Cagliari Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) activity during the last four years considering 22 asphyxiated babies (coming from 9 different hospitals) who underwent hypothermia treatment. The main result was that the need to resuscitation procedures at birth correlates with adverse outcomes. Asphyxia still remains a matter of great concern also as medico legal claims. Considering that neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous condition, it is unlikely that it will be eradicated. However, a comprehensive evaluation of all risk factors and of intrapartum surveillance available tools may reduce as much as possible adverse events.

40|$|Background: Purpose {{of current}} study was to {{describe}} the variations in the complex network of terminal branches of facial nerve in the face. The facial nerve passes through the substance of parotid gland in the plane between superficial and deep lobes. The knowledge of variation in the branching pattern of terminal branches {{is very important for}} surgeons to prevent the injuries which may <b>lead</b> to facial <b>palsy.</b> Methods: The present study includes fifty foetal parotid glands in 25 foetuses and 8 adult parotid glands of 4 cadavers. The glands exposed in fixed fetuses and adult cadavers, capsules removed. The superficial lobe of the gland reflected laterally and the trunk of facial nerve in the substance was observed. The divisions and terminal branches were traced. The variations in the divisions and terminal branches, loops between branches were observed and noted. Results: In the foetal specimens the facial nerve divides into 2 main divisions in 88 % of glands. The remaining 12 % foetal specimens the facial nerve divides directly into 5 terminal branches. 56 % foetal specimens show straight branching pattern, 12 %specimens show looping between zygomatic and buccal branch. In 32 % specimens the loop between upper buccal and lower buccal branches present. Multiple communications or complex pattern between two main divisions not found in this study. Conclusion: The variations noted are: In the foetal specimens the facial nerve divides into two main divisions in 88 % and in all adult specimens.

40|$|Background: A chance {{observation}} of return of excellent facial movement, after 18 {{months following the}} first stage of cross-face nerve grafting, without free functional muscle transfer, in a case of long-standing facial <b>palsy,</b> <b>lead</b> the senior author (RBA) to further investigate clinically. Patients and Methods: This procedure, now christened as cross-face nerve extension and neurotization, was carried out in 12 patients of very long-standing facial palsy (mean 21 years) in years 1996 - 2011. The mean patient age and duration of palsy were 30. 58 years and 21. 08 years, respectively. In patients, 1 - 5 a single buccal or zygomatic branch served as a donor nerve, but subsequently, we used two donor nerves. The mean follow-up period was 20. 75 months. Results: Successive patients had excellent to good return of facial expression with two fair results. Besides improved smile, patients could largely retain air in the mouth without any escape and had improved mastication. No complications were encountered except synkinesis in 1 patient. No additional surgical procedures were performed. Conclusion: There is experimental evidence to suggest that neurotization of a completely denervated muscle can occur by the formation of new ectopic motor end plates. Long-standing denervated muscle fibres eventually atrophy severely but are capable of re-innervation and regeneration, as validated by electron microscopic studies. In spite of several suggestions in the literature to clinically validate functional recovery by direct neurotization, the concept remains anecdotal. Our results substantiate this procedure, and {{it has the potential to}} simplify reanimation in longstanding facial palsy. Our work now needs validation by other investigators in the field of restoring facial animation...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{important}} advances in perinatal {{care in the}} past decades, asphyxia remains a severe condition leading to significant mortality and morbidity. Perinatal asphyxia has an incidence of 1 to 6 per 1, 000 live full-term births, and represents the third {{most common cause of}} neonatal death (23 %) after preterm birth (28 %) and severe infections (26 %). Many preconceptional, antepartum and intrapartum risk factors {{have been shown to be}} associated with perinatal asphyxia. The standard for defining an intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic event as sufficient to produce moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy which subsequently <b>leads</b> to cerebral <b>palsy</b> has been established in 3 Consensus statements. The cornerstone of all three statements is the presence of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7 and base deficit ≥ 12 mmol/L) at birth in a newborn exhibiting early signs of moderate or severe encephalopathy. Perinatal asphyxia may affect virtually any organ, but hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most studied clinical condition and that is burdened with the most severe sequelae. The feasibility of providing neuroprotection after HIE has been proven by hypothermia therapy, which is able to reduce the risk of death or major neurodevelopmental disability. Many promising neuroprotective agents might contribute to reduce hypoxic-ischemic brain injury through different mechanisms of action, but further studies are required to confirm their efficacy. The prognosis is dependent on the severity of the perinatal asphyxia. Only a minority of infants with severe HIE survive without handicap.   Proceedings of the International Course on Perinatal Pathology (part of the 10 th International Workshop on Neonatology · October 22 nd - 25 th, 2014)  · Cagliari (Italy) · October 25 th, 2014  ·  The role of the clinical pathological dialogue in problem solving Guest Editors: Gavino Faa, Vassilios Fanos, Peter Van Eyken </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} {{to be discussed}} in this paper is based on neurophysiology, for cerebral palsy is not an orthopædic but a neurological problem. Damage to the brain (the cause of cerebral <b>palsy)</b> <b>leads</b> to a disorder of muscular coordination and not to paralysis or paresis of muscles, as, for instance, in lower motor neurone lesions. We find disordered motor function in all patients, and often there are associated defects of vision, hearing, and speech. The motor system is affected centrally and therefore we do not confine ourselves to treating any particular muscle group but treat the body as a whole. The usual treatment consists of exercises used for orthopædic cases as though the patient could control his muscle function in the normal way. A normal central nervous system allows the patient to direct his nervous impulses {{so that he can}} contract or relax specific muscle groups in order to move, say, an elbow, a hand, or a foot. In such a person we can strengthen weak muscles and teach the patient to correct faulty postures and movement patterns. The patient with cerebral palsy has all the muscle power he needs for movements and his peripheral nerve supply is intact, but he cannot direct the impulses to his muscles in the normal way so as to produce separate movements. Sometimes his posture becomes completely fixed and he cannot move at all. When he does move, however, the movement is widespread and there is no fixation. He cannot direct his movements either and often flexes a limb when he wants to extend and vice versa The patient cannot contract or relax individual muscle groups or move parts of the body independently of each other. His coordination of posture and movements is abnormal and this involves all the affected parts of the body...|$|R
