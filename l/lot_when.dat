5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E

Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child.

The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> I go to Africa".|$|E

[...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope.

500|$|In 1790, the {{trustees}} of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a cadastral survey map of Romney. Prior to this survey, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of Romney sometime before the town's incorporation on December 23, 1762. On June 30, 1790, Mitchel submitted to {{the trustees}} a [...] "Plan of the Town of Romney," [...] which divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size, with four lots adjacent to the courthouse comprising the [...] "publick" [...] square. The Wirgman Building was later built upon the [...] "publick" [...] land lot numbered [...] "Lot 76". Romney's first cemetery was present on the <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> it {{was a part of}} the courthouse square. The cemetery's interments were located on the actual site, and to the rear, of the future Wirgman Building.|$|E
500|$|One notable {{feature of}} the comic is the {{blending}} of mythological elements from many different cultural traditions, especially from the British Isles and Native American mythology. Siddell attributes this style to {{his experience as a}} child: [...] "I moved about a <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> I was younger and had the opportunity to grow up hearing stories from {{different parts of the world}} and I've always been fascinated by them." [...] In addition to mythology, Siddell makes heavy use of alchemical themes; for example, the main character is named Antimony, after a toxic chemical element, and many pages feature artistic depictions of alchemical symbols. The symbol for antimony appears frequently in Gunnerkrigg Court: the character Antimony wears a necklace shaped like that symbol, the character Reynardine has the symbol imprinted on his wolf body, and the symbol is used to mark the end of a chapter.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} July 15, 2004, and {{marked the first}} {{occasion}} that an episode of the Star Trek franchise was shot digitally rather than using traditional film stock. Director of photography Marvin V. Rush later explained {{that this was an}} easy transition, and added that this made the filming process easier as a high-definition monitor was available on set allowing departments, such as make-up, to make immediate adjustments. Directing Enterprise once again was Allan Kroeker {{for the first half of}} [...] "Storm Front", who had helmed the previous episode [...] "Zero Hour". The production of the two parts intermingled over 14 days, with the second half directed by David Straiton. The initial two days of filming took place on the standing sets representing the Enterprise and the shuttlepod. The shoot moved to Stage 9 on the Paramount <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> it resumed after a weekend break, which had been set up to represent the interior of a New York City apartment.|$|E

25|$|During the Mexican {{period of}} San Diego's history, La Jolla was mapped as pueblo land and {{contained}} about 60 <b>lots.</b> <b>When</b> California became {{a state in}} 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated {{as part of the}} chartered City of San Diego. In 1870 Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A real estate boom in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.|$|R

Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me.

500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks.

Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E

[...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> showing her crazy and fun side.
