The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 <b>landing</b> <b>aid</b> radar. A TACAN aerial and electronic countermeasures pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid,</b> would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E
500|$|Following the recommencement of construction, {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the ship, based on wartime experience and Britain's post-war carrier warfare technology and innovations. These included an angled flight deck, steam catapult and a mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid,</b> making Melbourne the third aircraft carrier (following [...] and [...] ) to be constructed with these features, instead of having them added later.|$|E

2500|$|PIRATE {{operates}} in two IR bands, 3–5 and 8–11 micrometres. When {{used with the}} radar in an air-to-air role, it functions as an infrared search and track system, providing passive target detection and tracking. In an air-to-surface role, it performs target identification and acquisition. By supercooling the sensor even small variations in temperature can be detected at long range. Although no definitive ranges have been released an upper limit of 80nm has been hinted at; a more typical figure would be 30 to 50nm. [...] It also provides a navigation and <b>landing</b> <b>aid.</b> PIRATE {{is linked to the}} pilot’s helmet-mounted display. [...] It allows the detection of both the hot exhaust plumes of jet engines as well as surface heating caused by friction; processing techniques further enhances the output, giving a near-high resolution image of targets. The output can be directed to any of the Multi-function Head Down Displays, and can also be overlaid on both the Helmet Mounted Sight and Head Up Display.|$|E
2500|$|Following the war's end, {{work on the}} Majestic {{class was}} suspended, then {{restored}} to a low-priority status, with the rate of work increasing as foreign nations purchased the ships. Two, Magnificent and Terrible, entered service more-or-less as designed, but the next three were heavily upgraded with three British developments allowing the operation of large, fast, jet-propelled aircraft: the angled flight deck, the steam catapult, and the mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid.</b> The sixth, Leviathan, was not completed. Work was suspended in May 1946, and plans to convert her into a commando carrier or missile cruiser, or sell her to a foreign buyer, fell through. During the 1950s, she {{was used as an}} accommodation ship in Portsmouth Harbour and, in 1966, her boilers were removed and sold to the shipyard refitting the Colossus-class [...] for Argentine service. Leviathan was scrapped in May 1968. None of the completed Majestic-class vessels saw service in the Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|From mid-1957 until December 1960, {{the carrier}} {{underwent}} a massive refit and reconstruction in the Netherlands. The work {{was carried out}} by Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, and cost US$27 million. The most visible change was the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck. The size of the angle required that an accessway be built around the starboard side of the island superstructure; the weight acting as a counterbalance for the flight deck's portside overhang. Combined with the fitting of a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid,</b> these modifications permitted the operation of jet aircraft up to [...] in weight. The carrier's island superstructure was replaced, and a lattice mast was fitted to support the new fire control system and radar suite. The ship's boiler capacity was increased, and internal electricity was converted to AC through the installation of four turbo generators and one diesel generator.|$|E

2500|$|Vengeance was not {{reactivated}} for RN use, and on 14 December 1956, {{the carrier}} was {{sold by the}} Admiralty to Brazil for US$9 million. From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction at Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, which cost US$27 million. Modifications included the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck, a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid.</b> This was to allow the operation of jet aircraft, which were larger, faster, and heavier than the propeller aircraft previously operated by the carrier. A new superstructure was fitted, including a large lattice mast to support a new radar suite and fire control system. Boiler capacity was increased, and the internal electrics were converted to AC power. The length of the modernisation refit meant that while the carrier was the first purchased by a Latin American nation, she was the second to enter service; another Colossus-class carrier entered service with the Argentine Navy as [...] in July 1959.|$|E
2500|$|During the Korean War, Sydney was {{deployed}} to Korean waters in late 1951, with a wartime CAG of 805, 808, and 817 Squadrons embarked. The Fleet Air Arm operated in a strike, ground support, and escort role during the deployment, which saw three RAN pilots killed {{and a fourth}} seriously wounded, while thirteen aircraft were lost. Nine of these were shot down by North Korean flak artillery, with aircraft damaged by flak on at least ninety other occasions. The other four were lost in deck accidents, or crashed because of foul weather. Meanwhile, Majestic was undergoing major upgrades during construction to operate jet aircraft, including the installation of an angled flight deck, steam catapult, and a mirror <b>landing</b> <b>aid.</b> To allow the RAN to operate as a two-carrier force while Majestic was completed, the Royal Navy loaned the Colossus-class light carrier [...] to the RAN in late 1952. Vengeance arrived in Australia with three Bristol Sycamore helicopters for the Fleet Air Arm. Although not the first helicopters to see military service in Australia (that title belonging to a Sikorsky S-51 of the RAAF), the Sycamores formed the first Australian military helicopter squadron, and prompted the establishment of Australia's first helicopter pilot school.|$|E
