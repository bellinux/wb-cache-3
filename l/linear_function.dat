5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when stars were classified from A to Q based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen line. It thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple <b>linear</b> <b>function</b> of temperature. Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E
5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective <b>linear</b> <b>function</b> from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E
