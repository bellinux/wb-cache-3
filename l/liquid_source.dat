40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of liquid}} drops over solid substrates with a <b>liquid</b> <b>source</b> in {{the centre of}} the drop is considered from both theoretical and experimental points of view. For conditions of complete wetting the spreading is an overlapping of two processes: a spontaneous spreading and a forced flow caused by the <b>liquid</b> <b>source</b> in the centre. Both capillary and gravitational regimes of spreading are considered and power laws are deduced. In both cases of small and large droplets the exponent is a sum of two terms: the first term corresponds to the spontaneous spreading and the second term is determined by the intensity of the <b>liquid</b> <b>source.</b> In the case of a constant flow rate from the source the latter gives for the radius of spreading the following law R(t) ∼ t 0. 4 {{in the case of the}} capillary spreading and R(t) ∼ t 0. 5 in the case of gravitational spreading. In the case of partial wetting droplets spread with a constant advancing contact angle (at small capillary numbers). This yields R(t) ∼ t 1 / 3.

The binder SiO 2 {{is made from}} Perhydropolysilazane(PHPS), which is a an organosilicate polymer consisting of cyclic (SiH 2 -NH) n units. The PHPS changes into pure SiO 2 by heat treatment less than 450 °C, which can be easily coated on a substrate by spin coat. Compare to the conventional organic binders, SiO 2 is quite stable and has a good transparency. The composite BR showed more than 90 % of absolute reflectance at near infrared region.

40|$|As device {{geometry}} shrinks to 0. 35 p. m and below, the parasitic capacitance between closely spaced metal lines becomes {{important in terms}} of resistance-capacitance time delay in device switching. In this study, we investigated the use of fluorine doped plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition grown silicon oxide thin film as a low dielectric con-stant intermetal dielectric material. We evaluated C,F 6 and an organometallic <b>liquid</b> <b>source</b> triethoxyfluorosilane as the F dopant.

At similar F concentrations, the films deposited with the <b>liquid</b> <b>source</b> are always more stable than those deposited with C 2 F 6. This, in addition to the different stress vs. low frequency radio frequency power behavior between the two types of film, suggests that the already present Si-F bond in the liquid precursor results in a denser and more sta-ble film compared to the C,F 6 doped film where interstitial F may be present...|$|E
