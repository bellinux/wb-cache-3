5000|$|The {{definition}} for [...] "low-income areas" [...] first {{developed by the}} Bureau of the Census {{as part of its}} work for the newly established Office of Economic Opportunity, a new bureaucracy designed to administer most of the War on Poverty Programs created as a part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society legislative agenda. [...] The goal was to identify areas of major concentrations of poverty within large metropolitan areas. The original definition was formed through an attribute-based criterion. Each census tract was ranked by an equally weighted measurement of (1) an area's income, (2) level of education, (3) number of single-parent households, (4) percentage of low-skilled workers, and (5) quality of the housing stock. The lowest quartile from the rankings were then designated [...] "low income." [...] The 1970 census took the earlier attribute-based measure and translated it into a purely statistical one - defining [...] "low-income areas" [...] as census tracts with 20%-39% of its inhabitants falling below the poverty line and designating areas of [...] "high-poverty" [...] or “extreme poverty” as those with 40% or more of its inhabitants falling under the poverty line. The 20% threshold adopted in 1970 was derived by calibrating a statistic of household income that most closely approximated the 1960 <b>lower</b> <b>quartile.</b> The 40% threshold to designate [...] "high-poverty areas" [...] was set by doubling the low-income threshold. This 40% threshold became the common definition of [...] "concentrated poverty" [...] in policy and scholarly research.|$|E
50|$|Research has {{suggested}} that the enhancement of growth factor pathways, including that of GH/IGF-1, could potentially increase the risk of various cancers, including breast cancer. Increased proliferation due to increased IGF-1 activity has been suggested to possibly {{play a key role in}} the high risk of breast cancer seen in women with the BRCA1 mutation. Multiple large studies have found a correlation in premenopausal women between serum IGF-1 levels in the upper quartile of the normal range and IGFBP-3 levels in the <b>lower</b> <b>quartile</b> (i.e., high circulating IGF-1 levels and low circulating IFGBP-3 levels) and the risk of developing various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the increase in breast cancer risk has been found only to be modest (e.g., only more than twice the usual risk). Subsequent studies have found the increase in risk to be even less clear, and it is notable that high-normal range IGF-1 levels have been found to correlate only with premenopausal and not with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence. In any case, mice engineered to have lower circulating levels of IGF-1 show a lower risk of developing various cancers, including breast cancer. In contrast to the case of IGF-1, the upper quintile (20%) of postmenopausal women with the highest of both circulating estrogen and androgen levels have been found to have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (relative to lowest quintile, the risk is 2- to 3-fold higher). A significant positive association with breast cancer risk has also been found with prolactin levels in postmenopausal women.|$|E

Diet quality was assessed using components of macronutrients and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI- 2010). Associations were tested using linear regression analysis adjusted for total energy (kcal), age, gender, and race/ethnicity. One-day dNa in the <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles</b> were more likely reported among women, older adults (≥ 65 years old), and <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles</b> of total energy (kcal) (p-values ≤ 0. 001).

As dNa increased, meat protein, refined grains, dairy, and total vegetables, greens and beans densities increased; while total fruit and whole fruit densities decreased. Modified HEI- 2010 total score (total score without sodium component) increased as dNa increased (adjusted coefficient: 0. 11, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 07, 0. 15).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{relationships}} among cognitive functions, neurological soft signs, and clinical symptoms {{in a group of}} patients with chronic schizophrenia. A total of 90 patients were recruited. Blink rate was recorded when patients were in a resting and relaxed condition. Significant correlations were found only between blink rate and general psychopathology (p <. 01) and disinhibition soft signs (p <. 05). When the group was further divided into two subgroups by taking the <b>lower</b> and upper <b>quartiles</b> of their blink rate, patients at the upper quartiles exhibited significantly more disinhibition signs than those at the <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles.</b> There was also a trend for those patients at the upper quartiles to commit more error in a sustained attention task.

40|$|Background-—Socioeconomic status (SES) as {{reflected}} by residential zip code status may detrimentally influence {{a number of}} prehospital clinical, access-related, and transport variables that influence outcome for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing reperfusion. We sought to analyze the impact of SES on in-hospital mortality, timely reperfusion, and cost of hospitalization following STEMI. Methods and Results-—We used the 2003 – 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for this analysis. All hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of STEMI were identified using ICD- 9 codes. SES was assessed using median household income of the residential zip code for each patient. There was a significantly higher mortality among the lowest SES quartile {{as compared to the}} highest quartile (OR [95 % CI]: 1. 11 [1. 06 to 1. 17]). Similarly, there was a highly significant trend indicating a progressively reduced timely reperfusion among patients from <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles</b> (OR [95 % CI]: 0. 80 [0. 74 to 0. 88]). In addition, there was a lower utilization of circulatory support devices among patients from lower as compared to higher zip code quartiles (OR [95 % CI]: 0. 85 [0. 75 to 0. 97]). Furthermore, the mean adjusted cost of hospitalization among quartiles 2, 3, and 4, as compared to quartile 1 was significantly higher by $ 913, $ 2140, and $ 4070, respectively. Conclusions-—Patients residing in zip codes with lower SES had increased in-hospital mortality and decreased timely reperfusion following STEMI as compared to patients residing in higher SES zip codes. The cost of hospitalization of patients from higher SES quartiles was significantly higher than those from <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles.</b> (J Am Heart Assoc. 2014; 3 :e 001057 doi: 10. 1161...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{thromboxane}} A 2 (TxA 2), a key mediator of platelet activation and aggregation, {{are associated with}} an increased risk of cardiovascular events. We aimed at assessing the predictors of higher plasma levels of TxB 2, the stable metabolite of TxA 2, in consecutive patients presenting with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) on previous aspirin (ASA) treatment undergoing coronary angiography. Ninety-eight consecutive patients (age 61 ± 11, 75 % males) with NSTEACS, on previous chronic ASA treatment, were prospectively enrolled in this study. Coronary disease extent was assessed by angiography according to the Bogaty score. In all patients, admission plasma levels of TxB 2 (pg/ml) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and patients showing TxB 2 levels in the fourth quartile were compared to patients showing TxB 2 levels in the <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles.</b> Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that platelet count (odds ratio [OR] 1. 18, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 - 1. 63, p= 0. 04), multivessel coronary disease (OR 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 3. 67, p= 0. 03), and coronary atherosclerosis extent index (OR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 45 - 6. 79, p= 0. 001) were independent predictors of TxB 2 level upper quartile. Of note, C-reactive protein serum levels were similar in patients with TxB 2 levels in the upper quartile as compared to those in the <b>lower</b> <b>quartiles</b> (p= 0. 49). In conclusion, NSTE-ACS patients with severe coronary atherosclerosis may have incomplete suppression of TxA 2 production despite chronic ASA therapy. This finding suggests that additional efforts should be made to lower TxA 2 levels in patients with widespread coronary artery disease. © Schattauer 2012...|$|R
