Often in legal literature, legal principles are considered to be legal norms, general <b>legal</b> norms, <b>legal</b> <b>values</b> etc. In fact, legal principles are just legal norms that different from the latter are legal norms of general application that ignore specific legal facts.

In other words, do legal facts have a place in our ‘disenchanted’ or naturalistic (in the scientific sense) understanding of the world. In the final section of this paper, I evaluate naturalism and nonnaturalism in law and consider the future of the debate and its relevance for understanding the connection between law, morality and legal normativity...|$|R

Previous studies of Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s anti-corruption efforts have understandably situated them in the context of local history, including both Chinese folk culture and the Hong Kong Government 2 ̆ 7 s need to rebuild legitimacy following major civil disturbances between 1966 and 1968. This article does not disagree with these emphases, but argues that the attack on corruption is equally a part of British cultural history. Drawing on newly-available archival material, this article shows that longstanding British antipathy to corruption provided political and <b>legal</b> <b>values</b> on which Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Colonial officials drew when the local context made the tackling of corruption politically advantageous. At the same time, though, British legal culture was as much an obstacle as an inspiration to anti-corruption efforts. In particular, the Hong Kong Government 2 ̆ 7 s Prevention of Bribery Ordinance conflicted with British <b>legal</b> <b>values</b> concerning the rights of the accused, and the British Fugitive Offenders Act hindered London 2 ̆ 7 s ability to support the extradition of a notoriously corrupt police official, Peter Godber.
