Examples of IP mechanisms include Haskell's type classes, Scala's implicits, Agda's instance arguments, Coq's type classes, and Rust's traits. The design of IP mechanisms has led to heated debate: proponents of one school argue the desirability of coherence, ensuring each implicit has a unique resolution; while proponents of another school argue for the power and flexibility of <b>local</b> <b>scoping</b> or overlapping instances. The current state-of-affairs seems to indicate the two goals {{are at odds with}} one another, and cannot easily be reconciled. This paper presents Cochis, the Calculus Of CoHerent ImplicitS, an improved variant of the implicit calculus that offers flexibility while preserving coherence and avoiding ambiguity. Cochis supports <b>local</b> <b>scoping,</b> overlapping instances, first-class instances, and higher-order rules, while remaining type safe and coherent. Cochis has a compact formulation. We introduce a logical formulation of how to resolve implicits, which is simple but ambiguous and incoherent, and a second formulation, which is less simple but unambiguous and coherent. Every resolution of the second formulation is also a resolution of the first, but not conversely. Parts of the second formulation bear a close resemblance to a standard technique for proof search called focussing. nrpages: 51 status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} science, a {{local variable}} is a variable that is given <b>local</b> <b>scope.</b> Local variable references in the function or block {{in which it}} is declared override the same variable name in the larger scope. In programming languages with only two levels of visibility, local variables are contrasted with global variables. On the other hand, many ALGOL-derived languages allow any number of nested levels of visibility, with private variables, functions, constants and types hidden within them, either by nested blocks or nested functions. Local variables are fundamental to procedural programming, and more generally modular programming: variables of <b>local</b> <b>scope</b> are used to avoid issues with side-effects that can occur with global variables.|$|E

We provide (i) a fully compositional relational semantics for a first-order programming language with a construct for local variable scoping; and (ii) an equational proof system based on Kleene algebra with tests for proving equivalence of programs in this language.

To address the routing scalability problems caused by this rapid growth, we propose an evolutionary approach that is incrementally deployable and provides immediate benefits to any adopting ASes. The basic premise of the approach is that route aggregation removes from routing tables the unnecessary topological details about remote portions of the Internet. We demonstrate that aggregation can be applied incrementally starting from <b>local</b> <b>scopes</b> within individual routers and individual ASes, and gradually expanded to the global Internet scope. The evaluation studies show that route aggregation is effective in addressing FIB scalability problems within a router and within a network. I...|$|R

The stack is used for data that has a simple last-in, first-out lifetime determined by block structure; the other part (often called the heap) is used for data whose lifetime extends beyond the scope of program blocks. The heap is periodically "garbage collected" to reclaim memory that is no longer needed. Tofte and Talpin's region calculus [23] attempts to unify these two styles of memory management. The region calculus divides memory into regions, and provides a <b>local</b> <b>scoping</b> mechanism for those regions. Every value created by the pro [...] ...|$|R
