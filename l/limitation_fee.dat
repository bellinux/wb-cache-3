The Supreme Court itself recognized in Abood that implementing its <b>limitations</b> on agency <b>fees</b> {{would be difficult to}} administer, and in dicta suggested that further rulings would clarify its thinking. But the Beck decision did not provide this clarification.

Because of this confusion, some lower courts have {{gone so far as to}} approve schemes whereby union members may assert their Beck rights only during limited [...] "window periods" [...] (in apparent contravention of Pattern Makers) and that Beck objectors renew their objection annually (in apparent contravention of General Motors).

40|$|Proponents of {{tort reform}} applied to medical {{malpractice}} argue for change {{partly on the}} premise that the threat of lawsuits has made medical care more costly. Using U.

Direct reforms (caps on damages, abolition of punitive damages, eliminating mandatory prejudgment interest, and collateral source offset) did not significantly reduce payments for Medicare-covered services in any specification. Indirect reforms (<b>limitations</b> on contingency <b>fees,</b> mandatory periodic payments, joint-and-several liability reform, and patient compensation funds) significantly reduced Medicare payments only in a specification based on any hospitalization, but not in analysis of hospitalization for each of four common chronic conditions. Neither direct nor indirect reforms had a significant effect on the health outcomes, with one exception. The overall conclusion is that tort reforms do not significantly affect medical decisions, nor do they have a systematic effect on patient outcomes. Reform Medicare Liability Malpractice Tort...|$|R
40|$|I empirically {{study the}} expert’s agency {{problem in the}} context of lawyers and their clients. Incentives of lawyers and clients are {{misaligned}} in dispute resolution under contingency fee arrangement with which lawyers receive a fraction of recovered payment as compensation while bearing the legal cost. Lawyers prefer to pursue a case less than their clients prefer as they incur all the legal costs and receive smaller fraction of payment. In this paper, I measure the degree to which lawyers work in the interest of their clients. To do so, I construct a bargaining model of dispute resolution that nests two special cases as well as their convex combinations in which lawyers work in their clients’best interests and in which they work in their own interests, and estimate the model using data of medical malpractice disputes. The timing of dropped cases identi…es the nesting parameter because cases are dropped more frequently and at earlier timings if lawyers work in their own interests. I …nd that lawyers work almost perfectly in their own interest.

Finally, I evaluate the impact of tort reform on contingency fee, and show that <b>limitation</b> of contingency <b>fee</b> lower the joint surplus further...|$|R
40|$|LIMITATION ON FEES FOR STATE PARKS. ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FEES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Prohibits {{fees for}} day use of state coastal parks and beaches. Limits fees charged in state parks, other than beaches, to {{reasonable}} and direct costs of maintenance, as provided. Enacts purchase provision as specified. Increases initial vehicle registration fees for environmental license plates by $ 5 and by $ 10 for renewal and retention. Adds severability clause; requires amendment by initiative, except for increases in fees, as specified; and provides for intervening statutory changes. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact {{on state and}} local governments: This measure could result in an annual revenue loss to the State Parks and Recreation Fund of $ 12 million, beginning in 1992. The losses would result in either (1) increased state funding from other sources (including the General Fund) or (2) reductions in services throughout the park system (including potential park closures). <b>Fee</b> <b>limitations</b> on other parks would not reduce fee revenues to the State Parks and Recreation Fund in the foreseeable future, because the current cost to operate and maintain each state park is significantly more than the fee revenue from each park.

40|$|The {{right of}} access to civil justice is a {{cornerstone}} of the Belgian legal order. At present time, however, financial barriers prevent about {{three quarters of the}} Belgian population from fully asserting their subjective rights. As traditionally, apart from legal aid, private funding is the dominant method of funding a civil claim in Belgium, alternative funding options in between private and public funding might hold some prospects for improving the access to civil ustice. Therefore this paper aims to provide an in-depth economic analysis of the effects of cost shifting, client-lawyer fee arrangements and legal expenses insurance on the various dimensions of the access to civil justice. In summary, the main results from the analysis are that theoretically all three alternative funding methods may hold certain prospects for improving the accessibility of civil justice. But, as far as empirical data are available, cost shifting fits least the requirements for solving the policy issue addressed in this paper. However, the validity of this empirical observation is subject to certain <b>limitations.</b> Both contingency <b>fees</b> and legal expenses insurance hold clear prospects for overcoming risk aversion and liquidity constraints. Also, relative to hourly fees, the incentive scheme inherent to contingency fees appears most appropriate to curb lawyer opportunism. The involvement of a legal expenses insurer may lead lawyers to behave less opportunistically too. Finally, within the current legal framework, insurers' control of costs and quality requires their direct or indirect involvement in the civil justice administration system. This may pose some challenging policy issues as the market for legal expenses insurance further develops in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} an image {{to the point}} on information provided to consumers before {{the conclusion of a}} credit contract, starting with the importance of information and ending with the legal framework. A high consumer protection may be achieved primarily through consumer information. The complexity of banking services but also the vulnerability of consumers in relation to the banks and the unbalanced relationship led to the need to develop specific legislation that clearly establishes the rights and obligations of the parties of a credit agreement for consumers. In this regard, in 2008, after many debates, Directive 2008 / 48 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit agreements for consumers was adopted. At national level, the Directive was transposed by the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 50 / 2010 on credit agreements for consumers. Taking into account national specificities, such as lack of experience of consumers in financial products, the irresponsible lending and the unfair practices of creditors, the national act includes wider provisions than the European Directive, such as those relating to <b>fees</b> <b>limitations</b> or those related to the calculation of the variable interest rate. Also the GEO no 50 / 2010 applies to all credit agreements concluded by consumers and creditors. As regards the advertising, any advertisement shall include a series of standard information.

40|$|This book {{is borne}} {{out of the}} {{observation}} of a certain gap in the legal literature on the European internal market, which has traditionally focused on substantive issues - such as the content and {{the scope of the}} rules on free movement, including adjacent policies such as State aid control - and on their impact on the allocation of powers between the European institutions and Member States. Little attention has been devoted {{to the way in which}} these rules shape the administrative institutions in charge of securing the internal market. This is, precisely, the subject of this book. The book builds on the notion of "European administrative union" and, hence, on an understanding of the European administration as a sum of institutions, bodies or agencies - both European and national - which act cooperatively. It is against this complex reality that the different chapters of the book scrutinize the organizational and procedural specificities of the different public administrations that interact in the internal market. Some chapters address these issues from a cross-sector perspective (e. g., the studies on the public administration associated to the four fundamental freedoms or the study on independent regulatory authorities) while others do so from a sector-specific perspective (e. g., the studies on the banking union, the European system of State aid control, the European networks of competition and food authorities, or the administrative implications of public procurement rules). The combination of both perspectives provides new insights into the administrative dimension of the internal market.
