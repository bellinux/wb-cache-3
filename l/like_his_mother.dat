The adult Jason (Derek Mears) kidnaps Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), a girl who looks <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> and holds her prisoner in his underground tunnels.

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012–2015 {{revealed that}} Nyuserre Ini undertook building {{works on the}} valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest {{in the administration of}} the pyramid town of Khafra and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, who bore the same name as Nyuserre's mother and <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.|$|E

25|$|Edmund – 23 years old, {{the younger}} and more intellectually and poetically {{inclined}} son. He is thin and wiry.

He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings.

6000|$|Herbert {{looked up}} surprised, not much liking {{to become an}} experience. He had had less {{intercourse}} with ladies than many boys of humbler pretensions, for <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> had always scouted the idea of sending her children to a Sunday-school, and she was neither <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> friends nor <b>his</b> preconceived notions. 'There! for want of an introduction, I must introduce myself. Your cousin Bertha, or Birdie, whichever you like best.' ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> Kocher was {{a deeply}} {{religious}} man and {{also part of}} the Moravian Church. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God. He thought that the rise of materialism (especially in science) was a great evil, and he attributed the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E
25|$|George was {{considered}} to be the cleverest of the Imperial children. He was also outgoing, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother.</b> George and Nicholas shared the same tutors, but studied in adjoining rooms. They followed the course of the Academy of the Russian General Staff. Their tutors were distinguished professors. Their English teacher, Charles Heath, had once been tutor to their uncles, Grand Dukes Sergei and Pavel. Both brothers spoke and wrote faultless English. From Mr. Heath they acquired a love of sport, particularly shooting and fly-fishing. They also spoke fluent French and passable German and Danish. George displayed signs of a promising career in the Navy before falling ill with tuberculosis in 1890.|$|E

60|$|It {{was as if}} he {{perceived}} the beauty of youth {{for the first time in}} Hugh's slender, well balanced, khaki-clad body. There was infinite delicacy in his clear complexion, his clear eyes; the delicately pencilled eyebrow that was so exactly <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's.</b> And this thing of brightness and bravery talked as gravely and as wisely as any weather-worn, shop-soiled, old fellow....|$|R
60|$|Jem was {{the child}} of the House of Dreams. All the others had been born at Ingleside. He had curly red hair, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's,</b> and frank hazel eyes, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> father's; he had <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> fine nose and his father's steady, humorous mouth. And {{he was the only}} one of the family who had ears nice enough to please Susan. But he had a {{standing}} feud with Susan because she would not give up calling him Little Jem. It was outrageous, thought thirteen-year-old Jem. Mother had more sense.|$|R
25|$|One famous bakeneko {{story is}} about a man named Takasu Genbei, whose mother’s {{personality}} changed completely after his pet cat went missing for many years. His mother avoided the company {{of friends and family}} and would take her meals alone in her room. When the family peeked in on her, they saw a cat-like monster in the mother's clothes, chewing on animal carcasses. Takasu, still skeptical, slew what looked <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> and after one day his mother's body turned back into his pet cat that had been missing. Takasu then tore up the floorboards of his mother's room to find her skeleton hidden there, her bones gnawed clean of all flesh.|$|E
500|$|<b>Like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> {{in later}} life, Kīnaʻu was often {{associated}} with supernatural power due to his royal rank. During {{a trip to the}} island of Hawaii in January 1859, his arrival on the island coincided with the eruption of Mauna Loa. It was reported that [...] "it was believed by large proportion of the native population of the island, that Pele had thrown forth the lava stream in special honor of his arrival".|$|E

Shikadai is voiced by Kenshō Ono in Japanese and by Todd Haberkorn in the English dub.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 her son, Curt Nyström Stoopendahl (1893-1965), {{followed}} in her footsteps and {{also became a}} popular postcard and poster artist, staying very close to <b>his</b> <b>mother’s</b> artistic style. Even his signature, “Curt Nyström”, looked <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother’s.</b> Likewise, her brother-in-law, Georg Stoopendaal, already {{in the beginning of}} the 19th century found postcards to be a good source of income, unlike his more serious paintings, and his Christmas cards are also clearly inspired by Jenny Nyström's.|$|R
5000|$|At age 14, Sy Dang ventured as an {{interpreter}} {{for the local}} French garrison. He tried {{the prospect of being}} a Christian Brother, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> brother, but found he was not suited for a [...] "pious", teaching life. He decided to follow a military career. He married Cam De Nguyen at the age of twenty-one. She converted to Roman Catholicism; the couple had ten children.|$|R

500|$|Shortly after Gardner's wife becomes mad, the {{vegetation}} begins eroding into a grey powder {{and the water}} from the well becomes tainted. One of Gardner's sons, Thaddeus, goes insane <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> and is similarly locked in a different room in the attic. The livestock begins turning grey and dying and, like the crops, their meat is tasteless and inedible. Thaddeus eventually dies and Merwin, another of Gardner's sons, goes missing during an excursion to retrieve water from the contaminated well. After two weeks of silence from Gardner, Pierce visits the farmstead and witnesses the tale's eponymous horror {{for the first time in}} the attic. Gardner's final son, Zenas, has disappeared and the [...] "colour" [...] has infected Nahum's wife, whom Pierce puts out of her misery. He then flees the decaying house as the horror destroys the last surviving resident, Nahum.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Often, after driving all day, Fred sat on deck {{beside his}} fat friend, while the boat glided on through {{miles and miles}} of solemn, {{unbroken}} old woods, and heard him sing about [...] "de New Jerusalem," [...] about [...] "good old Moses, and Paul, and Silas," [...] with a kind of dreamy, wild pleasure. To be sure it was not <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> singing; but then it had a sort of good sound, although he never could very precisely make out the meaning.|$|R

6000|$|In his musing upon Altair {{he began}} to {{remember}} some very curious details. He recalled that at first glance he had inwardly exclaimed, [...] "How much she looks like Leo!" [...] The lips and chin were similar, only sadder, sweeter--and the poise of the head was like hers also. But the brow and the eyes were more <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's.</b> It was as though Altair were at once the heavenly sister of Leonora and the spirit daughter of <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> and the love which lay on the tremulous lips, the deep, serious eyes, moved him still with almost undiminished power. He was eager to see the celestial face again.|$|R
