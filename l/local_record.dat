5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective <b>local</b> <b>record</b> stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E

An entire page of the Edmonton Bulletin was devoted to the reopening, including a congratulating ad from a <b>local</b> <b>record</b> store, an ad for the electrical contractors who installed the wiring, and a message congratulating the Princess placed by the managers of three other establishments already wired for sound: the Rialto, Empress and Capitol Theatres. The physical renovations necessary to accommodate the new wiring were carried out by S. H. Muttart, an important local builder and namesake of the Muttart Conservatory in Edmonton’s River Valley. The first talkie screened at the Princess was Close Harmony starring Buddy Rogers and Nancy Carroll.|$|E

In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to <b>local</b> <b>record</b> producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E

25|$|Though major record {{companies}} dominate the Turkish industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Indie music is mostly based around <b>local</b> <b>record</b> labels with limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim {{to be signed}} to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen to.|$|E

[...] He or Hooker later presented them to Bernie Besman, who ran the Detroit area's only professional record company. [...] Although Hooker had played mostly with an ensemble at that time, Besman decided to record him solo. [...] This put {{the attention}} solely on the singer/guitarist, in contrast to the prevailing jump blues style, which emphasized ensemble instrumentation. [...] Recent hit singles by Muddy Waters and Lightnin' Hopkins had also used this stripped-down, electrified Delta blues-inspired approach.|$|E
500|$|On its {{original}} release in March 1995, The Beacon Street Collection was only available in <b>local</b> <b>record</b> stores in Orange County, California and at No Doubt's shows. Its rawer sound proved {{popular with the}} band's fans and the band's first batch of one thousand copies sold out within {{only a few months}} after its release. Interscope realized the band's potential and allowed them to record their third album, Tragic Kingdom in various Los Angeles studios, [...] "wherever they could get a deal on a studio". During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interested in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label Trauma Records, which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and Tragic Kingdom got the personal focus that comes from a small company.|$|E
500|$|Despite some {{opinion polls}} {{indicating}} a Labour lead, most commentators expected that Winston Churchill's prestige would ensure a comfortable Conservative {{victory in the}} July 1945 general election. Before polling day, The Manchester Guardian surmised that [...] "the chances of Labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority... are pretty remote". The News of the World predicted a working Conservative majority, while in Glasgow a pundit forecast the result as Conservatives 360, Labour 220, Others 60. The expectations of a Labour victory in Liverpool Exchange were not high, but Bessie's chances were boosted by the poor <b>local</b> <b>record</b> of the sitting member, Colonel Shute, and she herself was confident. Defying most forecasts, across the country Labour won 393 seats, and with an overall majority of 146, Clement Attlee formed the first majority Labour government. Bessie won Liverpool Exchange with a majority of 665 from 16,000 votes cast.|$|E

40|$|A global record (i. e. {{a set of}} <b>local</b> <b>records,</b> one {{for each}} process of an {{asynchronous}} computation) abstracts what is usually called global state, global checkpoint or global snapshot in particular problems. This paper concentrates on consistency of global records. First, a general model of asynchronous computations, including the classical shared memory model and several message passing models, is introduced. Then, under this general model, a necessary and sufficient condition, stating whether an arbitrary set of <b>local</b> <b>records</b> can be included in some consistent global record, is proved. Finally, it is shown that, when a simple strategy (derived {{as a consequence of}} the previous theorem) is followed by each process of an asynchronous computation, then all <b>local</b> <b>records</b> taken by processes belong to consistent global records. Such a result can be used to design efficient snapshoting or checkpointing algorithms in asynchronous computations. Key-words: Distributed systems, asynchronous co [...] ...|$|R
