First-principles calculations for KLT supercells were used to investigate these phenomena. Lattice dynamics calculations for KLT exhibit a Li off-centering instability. The energetics of Li-displacements for isolated <b>Li-ions</b> and for Li-Li pairs up to 4 th neighbors were calculated. Interactions between nearest neighbor <b>Li-ions,</b> in a Li-Li pair, strongly favor ferroelectric alignment along the pair axis. Such Li-Li pairs can be considered "seeds" for polar nanoclusters in KLT. Electrostriction, local oxygen relaxation, coupling to the KT soft-mode, and interactions with neighboring <b>Li-ions</b> all enhance the polarization from Li off-centering. Calculated hopping barriers for isolated <b>Li-ions</b> and for nearest neighbor Li-Li pairs are in good agreement with Arrhenius fits to experimental dielectric data.

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the <b>Li-ion</b> batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{and compares}} {{the effectiveness of}} estimating two health-relevant electrochemical variables, the side reaction current density {{and the number of}} cyclable <b>Li-ions,</b> as indicators of battery state of health (SOH) in battery management systems of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). The choice of these two electrochemical variables {{is based on the assumption}} that battery degradation is mainly caused by consumption of cyclable <b>Li-ions.</b> This assumption is valid for the two widely-used types of EV/HEV batteries considered herein, namely LiFePO 4 and LMO-based mixture batteries. This dissertation provides formulations to estimate these two electrochemical variables from measurements of battery terminal voltage and current. Estimation is necessary here because the electrochemical variables cannot be measured on-board. Estimation of the side reaction current density is formulated as a subsystem identification problem and is solved using retrospective-cost subsystem identification. A new subsystem identification algorithm, the two-step filter, is also developed to improve the estimation accuracy of the side reaction current density under the presence of state of charge (SOC) estimation errors. On the contrary, the number of cyclable <b>Li-ions</b> is estimated as an unknown battery parameter using the extended Kalman filter. This dissertation also analyzes the robustness of estimation of the two electrochemical variables by providing a framework to obtain the lower bound of relative estimation errors of each of the two variables under non-ideal conditions for algorithms that estimate the variable by minimizing the error between measured voltage and estimated voltage. This framework determines that the lower bound of the relative estimation error of a variable is proportional to the error in either measurement or estimate of battery terminal voltage caused by non-ideal conditions, and inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the voltage to the variable and the magnitude of the variable itself. This framework also yields the same lower bound for the covariance of unbiased estimates as given by the Fisher information. The effectiveness of estimating the side reaction current density and the number of cyclable <b>Li-ions</b> as SOH indicators is also discussed through comparison. Compared to the number of cyclable <b>Li-ions</b> or other SOH indicators such as capacity and internal resistance, the side reaction current density is a more ideal SOH indicator when it can be estimated accurately, because it can instantaneously indicate battery degradation rate. However, estimation of the side reaction current density under practical non-ideal conditions is fundamentally difficult due to the fact that the sensitivity of the voltage to the side reaction current density and the magnitude of the side reaction current density are both low. On the other hand, the number of cyclable <b>Li-ions</b> is a promising SOH indicator for battery management systems in practice because it provides an indication of the remaining capacity from the first principles, can be estimated using a standard algorithm and simple models, and demonstrates high robustness to non-ideal conditions. Future extensions of this work include i) studying the impact of temperature on estimation of health-relevant electrochemical variables by including thermal dynamics in the model, ii) validating experimentally estimation of the number of cyclable <b>Li-ions,</b> and iii) extending estimation of the side reaction current density to other side-reaction-based battery degradation and safety problems such as Lithium plating and dendrite formation...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{three-dimensional}} ternary vanadate compounds {{with excellent}} structural stability on exfoliated graphene nanoflacks allows the first success of conversion-type sodium vanadate anode candidate for high-rate and long-life lithium-ion batteries(LIBs). Corresponding additive-free self-anchoring behavior of active sodium vanadates material on graphene surface is representatively investigated, architecturing unique dendritic structure, a first-of-this-kind configuration, with robust flexibility and sufficient capability of structure-preservation. The prepared nanocomposite provides a high reversible capacity over 800 mA h g(- 1) and ultrafast charging/discharging capability with <b>Li-ions</b> via conversion-type reaction. More remarkably, the well-designed structure retains more than 96 % of initial capacity {{with respect to}} their ultralong cycling stability, demonstrating the combined advantages of the facile hydrothermal protocol, high active material loading and architecture configuration for high-performance <b>Li-ions</b> storage.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the stability and the interactions in dispersions of colloidal fumed silica, Aerosil 200, and the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetraflouroborate (BMImBF 4) {{as a function of}} Li-salt concentration (LiBF 4). Photon correlation spectroscopy was used to study the aggregation behavior at low silica concentration and Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the interactions in the ionic liquid and with the silica surface. We find that the addition of LiBF 4 increases the stability of the dispersions, with smaller agglomerates of silica particles and higher gelation concentrations in the presence of Li-salt. The increased stability with the addition of Li-salt is explained by the formation of a more stable solvation layer, where <b>Li-ions</b> accumulate on the surface. This leads to an increased interaction between lithium ions and the BF 4 - anions in the solvation layer as seen by Raman spectroscopy. Upon gelation the <b>Li-ions</b> are expelled from the surface as hydrogen bonding between the silica particles are formed.

25|$|Another area of {{research}} focuses on the prevention of thermal runaway in batteries. The researchers coated the anode or separator layer of the battery with microspheres sensitive to heat.

25|$|Contrary to {{electric}} vehicle applications, batteries for stationary storage do not suffer from mass or volume constraints. However, {{due to the}} large amounts of energy and power implied, the cost per power or energy unit is crucial. The relevant metrics to assess the interest of a technology for grid-scale storage is the $/Wh (or $/W) rather than the Wh/kg (or W/kg).

Through in situ XRD, Tan et al. [21] proposed that lithiation involves a single, continuous, topotactic insertion of <b>Li-ions</b> in the range 0 – 1 Li+.

Moreover, the ameliorated diffusivity of the electrolyte through channels and pores would ensure a high specific surface area {{in contact with the}} electrode and hence an increased possibility for <b>Li-ions</b> to react. In the specific case of fluorides, there could also be an additional positive effect due to the minimization of nanoparticle aggregation induced by the conversion reaction [61].|$|R
