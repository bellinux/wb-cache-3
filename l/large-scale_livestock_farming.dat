50|$|Dendrophryniscus leucomystax is {{a species}} of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to {{southern}} and southeastern Brazil and occurs in coastal forests of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Santa Catarina states. It is a very common species living in secondary and primary forests on leaves near the ground and in bogs. Breeding takes place in rain pools on the ground. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by clear-cutting of forests and <b>large-scale</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—China is {{the largest}} and fastest {{developing}} country in the world. Its rapid economic growth has led to rapidly increasing energy consumption and serious pollution. Jiangxi province {{is the most important}} livestock and poultry base. Along with the economic development and the improvement of people's living standards, Jiangxi is confronted with severe pollution problems because of the rapid development of the livestock and poultry industry which bringing serious challenges to the ecological environment. Cultivating microalgae by biogas slurry is an effective method of biological pollution control. Taking a demonstration project which can realize energy microalgae cultivation and livestock biogas slurry deep purification as example, the difficulties in practice of biogas slurry cultivating microalgae are analyzed and countermeasures to the problems are discussed in details.

30|$|Healthy {{livestock}} farming technologies and management practices are a central concern in animal farming industry, which must provide high-quality meat products to safely meet human consumption requirements. In particular, pigs {{are one of}} the most important economic livestock species in numerous countries. Pigs represent the largest livestock product in China, with great commercial and economic values worldwide (Bai et al. 2014; Sun and Jia 2015; Yu and Abler 2014). However, intensive or <b>large-scale</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> causes various problems such as serious feed resource shortages and grain competition between humans and livestock (Ilea 2009). In addition, the utilization of antibiotics in livestock husbandry potentially poses a threat to livestock health, and it could lead to environmental pollution as well as a decline in animal immunity, gut microbiota disorders, and an increased risk of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria genes in the environment (Baquero et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2018). Residues of antibiotics in livestock products are likely harmful to human health (Marshall and Levy 2011). However, the restricted use of antibiotics in feed used in {{livestock farming}} may increase disease rates in animals and decrease amounts of global products. Therefore, it is imperative to develop safe and effective feed additives that could replace antibiotics, thus improving livestock health and products. Recently, studies focused on replacing antibiotics in livestock husbandry have examined the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and other dietary additives on livestock (Abudabos et al. 2017; Markowiak and Slizewska 2018; Marshall and Levy 2011). Moreover, these studies have aroused the interests of scientists globally, since these newly developed feed supplements were found to improve livestock health and growth (Markowiak and Slizewska 2018).|$|E

40|$|Integrated {{aquaculture}} is {{inclusive of}} interactive utilization {{of resources and}} ecosystems in the artificial rearing of aquatic animals and plants. By the nature, purpose and scale of the operation, integrated fish culture can be categorized into five major modes. One is the traditional small-scale subsistence farming where fish are produced by recycling on-farm wastes in ponds or rice field, two is recycling of human excreta, three is the industrialized commercial operation by integrating medium and <b>large-scale</b> poultry or <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> with ponds for fish production, four is integration of aquaculture with natural ecosystems, e. g., shrimp culture with mangroves, cage and pen culture in lakes, cove culture in reservoirs. The fifth is environmental-oriented integration, where waste effluents from intensive aquaculture ponds are recycled to improve water quality and to grow filter feeder/ herbivores or macrophytes as secondary crops.

40|$|We {{argue that}} an {{understanding}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> as normative practice clarifies how sustainability is to be understood in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is first approached by investigating its identity. We argue that the economic aspect qualifies and the formative aspect founds the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice. Observing the normativity related to these aspects {{will be the first}} task for the livestock farmer. In addition, we can distinguish conditioning norms applicable to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice which should be observed for competent performance of the practice. Failing to do justice to this normativity might affect the practice's sustainability only in the long term - this is especially the case with conditioning norms. Motives to observe normativity have, therefore, the character of an ultimate conviction regarding the flourishing of the practice. Finally, the sustainability of the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice crucially depends on the broader food system of which it is part...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{the scale and}} {{intensity}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> have increased significantly. At the same time, Western societies have become more urbanised and fewer people have close relatives involved in farming. As a result, most citizens have little knowledge or direct experience of what farming entails. In addition, more people are expressing concerns over issues such as farm animal welfare. This has led to increasing public demand for more sustainable ways of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> To date, {{little research has been}} carried out on the social pillar of sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} provide insights into the sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. This study reviews the key findings of earlier published interdisciplinary research about the social perceptions of dairy farming in the Netherlands and Norway (Boogaard et al., 2006, 2008, 2010 a and 2010 b) and synthesises the implications for sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> This study argues that the (sociocultural) sustainable development of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is not an objective concept, but that it is socially and culturally constructed by people in specific contexts. It explains the social pillar of the economics/ecological/social model sustainability in terms of the fields of tensions that exist between modernity, traditions and naturality – ‘the MTN knot’ – each of which has positive and negative faces. All three angles of vision can be seen in people's attitudes to dairy farming, but the weight given to each differs between individuals and cultures. Hence, sociocultural sustainability is context dependent and needs to be evaluated according to its local meaning. Moreover, sociocultural sustainability is about people's perceptions of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> Lay people might perceive <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> differently and ascribe different meanings to it than experts do, but their ‘reality’ is just as real. Finally, this study calls for an ongoing collaboration between social and animal scientists in order to develop <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems that are more socioculturally sustainable...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} monitoring Trenthorst, situated near Lübeck in a temperate {{maritime climate}} on loamy soils, {{was established in}} 2003 and compares two cash crop and three <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. We studied the soil mineral nitrogen contents of one cash crop and two <b>livestock</b> <b>farms,</b> specialised in dairy cows and goats/oilseeds resp., with {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> show a more even course of Nmin in the rotation and a higher rotation mean. The rotation average of Nmin in the cash crop farm was not lower than the ones in the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms.</b> But {{in the course of the}} rotations differences became evident: compared to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> the cash crop farm showed higher Nmin-values after the first rotation year (mulched vs. cut grass clover) but lower values in the fourth and fifth year of the rotation. As a precise nitrogen supply via manure as in the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> is impossible in a self-sustaining cash crop farm, the excess of nitrogen at the beginning and the lack of it towards the end of the rotation could not be balanced.

Excessive livestock waste {{as a result of}} intensive farming system need to be addressed. Although animal waste can be utilized as a manure to improve the physical and chemical properties of soil, it can also cause environmental hazard if not managed properly.
