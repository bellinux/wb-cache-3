5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their <b>lunch</b> at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own <b>lunch</b> food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given <b>lunch</b> vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having <b>lunch</b> in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional <b>lunch</b> due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for <b>lunch.</b> Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take <b>lunch</b> on their own time, workers responded with a strike.

The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E

50|$|School <b>lunches</b> {{must meet}} the {{applicable}} recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Regulations also state that school <b>lunches</b> must provide one-third of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, iron, calcium, and calories. School <b>lunches</b> must meet federal nutrition requirements {{over the course of}} one week's worth of <b>lunches.</b> However, local school food authorities may make decisions about which specific foods to serve and how they are prepared.|$|R

A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 This was an {{observational}} {{study of the}} food and nutrient contribution of <b>lunches</b> in the Food Pyramid Choices Menu system as offered to and eaten by 93 third graders participating from two schools in the Reynolds school district in Oregon. In response to current public health concerns in the U. S. and the emphasis on diets of moderation rather than simply nutritional adequacy, this study focused on the total and saturated fat content of the <b>lunches</b> offered to and eaten by third graders. In the Food Pyramid Choices Menu system, children are allowed to select their own <b>lunches</b> from a variety of entrees, milk, fruits, vegetables, and grain products. The meals as offered to the children were calculated as the mean amount of each food offered to each student in the school. Nutrient analysis for the average <b>lunches</b> as offered was done with Nutrikids (Lunchbyte Systems, Inc.) nutrient analysis software. One week of <b>lunches</b> were analyzed and averaged over the week. The meals as eaten were determined for each child by measuring the foods selected by each child, and subtracting the amount that was leftover by that child. The nutrient analysis for each child's <b>lunches,</b> as eaten, was averaged over the number of days that each child ate <b>lunches</b> while participating in the study. The nutrient content of <b>lunches</b> was analyzed using ESHA's Food Processor. Each student's data for each day was averaged over the week and then with data from all the students participating to arrive at the mean daily food and nutrient intakes. The <b>lunches</b> as offered and as eaten had total fat contents of 33...|$|R
50|$|Unhealthy school <b>lunches</b> {{contribute}} to malnutrition {{in both the}} short term and the long term. In many cases, unhealthy adult eating patterns {{can be traced back}} to unhealthy school <b>lunches,</b> because children learn eating habits from social settings such as school. A 2010 study of 1,003 middle-school students in Michigan found that those who ate school <b>lunches</b> were significantly more likely to be obese than those who did not.|$|R

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) <b>lunch</b> counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned <b>lunch</b> counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at <b>lunch</b> counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown <b>lunch</b> counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the <b>lunch</b> counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E

5|$|GCHS {{underwent}} a major remodeling project during the 2005–2006 school year. An open courtyard had previously {{existed in the}} central section of the school which had gone largely unused. School officials met and decided to enclose the courtyard and transform the space into a multi-purpose atrium tetrastylum. After nearly a year, construction was completed. The new multi-purpose area was used for additional seating during lunchtime, as well as conferences, banquets, and additional uses. The atrium featured a projection screen, a flat-screen HDTV, additional storage closets, a small elevated stage area, several unique design features, and additional entrances/exits to classrooms. The renovation was, however, largely regarded by students and residents of Garden City as a waste of resources, owing {{to the construction of}} the current high school. One of the main reasons for the enclosure of the courtyard was to provide adequate room for most of its students in a lunchroom of some sort. However, at the time, the high school espoused an open <b>lunch</b> policy, and consequently a majority of its close to 2,000 students left campus for <b>lunch.</b> Administrators responded to this in the 2007–2008 school year by closing <b>lunch</b> to freshmen, and the following year by closing <b>lunch</b> to sophomores who do not have special identification cards.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, <b>lunch,</b> and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its <b>lunch</b> menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving <b>lunch</b> from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria.
