5|$|A {{study in}} 2011 by Douglas Miller {{shows that in}} English county cricket, the {{proportion}} of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less likely to be out lbw when batting {{and more likely to}} dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received <b>leeway</b> whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batsmen from the subcontinent {{were less likely to be}} lbw wherever they played in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka {{had a lot of}} <b>leeway</b> in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographies. My thesis attempts, in {{the first}} {{instance}} to ascertain whether Islamic legal theory (usul) has made provisions for the accommodation of changing social exigencies. If such provisions have been made, are they adequately employed to achieve optimum benefit? In the second instance, the Islamic judicial process of discovering and formulating the Divine law and the elements that contribute towards it is subjected to scrutiny to ascertain whether it is proceeding according to the general provisions made for it in terms of the principles of the law or, whether this crucial process has since been abandoned, corrupted, distorted or replaced. I have chosen four representative classical works of usul al-fiqh on which to base my assessment of usul vis-a-vis changing social exigency. One of the works is a Shafi i exposition; the second two are Hanafi expositions, and the fourth is a general exposition not located in a particular legal school (madhhab). After illustrating the inherent <b>leeways</b> {{to be found in the}} legal propositions together with the inherent scope accompanying the notions of maslahah (utility) and urf (prevailing norms), I proceed to evaluate the extent to which these <b>leeways</b> are employed in the actual judicial process of two of the world's most authoritative judicial institutions namely; al-Azhar (Cairo) and Darul Ulum (Deoband). To do this, I analyze the fatwa (judicial decree) on organ transplantation from both these institutions. My analysis is not aimed at the outcome of the fatwahs, but rather at the processes involved in arriving at the particular verdicts. In my conclusion I point to the ample provisions made by legal theory to contend with any social exigency and to the tragic neglect of their employment in the application of the law to novel situations. It is, therefore, the inconsistency between the provisions of legal theory and the absence of their application in the actual judicial process that has contributed to the current tension between law and social change...|$|R

5|$|The game's {{script was}} written by Naotaka Hayashi, a staff writer at 5pb. whose most notable work {{at the time was}} visual novel Steins;Gate. After playing through Steins;Gate on the {{recommendation}} of another staff member, Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story, and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default. Another reason Asano wanted Hayashi was due to the plot's heavy use of parallel worlds. Hayashi's work on the game involved creating the plot and character settings. While he wrote the majority of the game's dialogue, more detailed work was given to writers at Square Enix and Silicon Studio. One of the supplementary writers was Silicon Studio's Keiichi Ajiro, who wrote the contents of D's Notebook. Ajiro also created the initial story outline with Asano. The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased during the writing process. During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember during the writing process was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high <b>leeway</b> for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, and to not overrun into multiple dialogue boxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little <b>leeway</b> for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally a programmer, with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based European office in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E

40|$|Multi-class {{supervised}} learning systems require {{the knowledge of}} the entire range of labels they predict. Often when learnt incrementally, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To avoid this, generous <b>leeways</b> have to be made to the philosophy of incremental learning that either forces a part of the machine to not learn, or to retrain the machine again with a selection of the historic data. While these hacks work to various degrees, they do not adhere to the spirit of incremental learning. In this article, we redefine incremental learning with stringent conditions that do not allow for any undesirable relaxations and assumptions. We design a strategy involving generative models and the distillation of dark knowledge as a means of hallucinating data along with appropriate targets from past distributions. We call this technique, phantom sampling. We show that phantom sampling helps avoid catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning. Using an implementation based on deep neural networks, we demonstrate that phantom sampling dramatically avoids catastrophic forgetting. We apply these strategies to competitive multi-class incremental learning of deep neural networks. Using various benchmark datasets and through our strategy, we demonstrate that strict incremental learning could be achieved. We further put our strategy to test on challenging cases, including cross-domain increments and incrementing on a novel label space. We also propose a trivial extension to unbounded-continual learning and identify potential for future development.

40|$|According to Adamovsky (2000) playing {{is a way}} {{to grasp}} {{information}} and to understand it by realizing its corporal and experiental aspects. This idea can be described as a performative perspective on play. According to Donald W. Winnicott (1970) playing is located in an intermediate area of phenomena of transition and transition objects thatcombine an individual with his/her surroundings. In this area a symbolicalorder is displayed which creates the experiences in the arts, imagination, and also in science. Thus, culture is understood as an amplification of playing interms of an objectification as a cultural experience. This means that playing can be ciphered out as learning when it realizes the corporal and experientalaspects of information and symbolical orders. Acting in terms of playing is not at first subject to moral or ethical rules. Agreements and rules are moreoverput up during the performative play. Then, differences at hand get a new validity structuring the play (Bateson 1972) and producing “new orders ofassociations and relations” (Sutton-Smith 2001). According to Richard Sennett(1974), rules can be read as a protection for individual <b>leeways,</b> becauseimpossible and possible options are clearly marked out. This is the ground fora “perspective taking“ (Flavell 1975), “to act in between identities“(Schechner 1990), for “projections of the ‘I on the ‘Non-I’, on “experiences onthe ‘extraneous’” (Waldenfels 1990) as intersubjective processes in playing(cf.

40|$|This work {{stems from}} the {{following}} underlying research question: which theoretical tools {{can be used to}} frame the issue of subjectivity in our contemporaneity? The current political-discursive order seems to be built upon new anthropological dispositions which rest on a cognitive and mechanistic conception of individuality. In this specific context is it possible to identify new conceptual fields that can open up the possibility for different ways of practising and thinking subjectivation? In their own disciplinary domains, psychoanalysis and philosophy establish themselves as possible answers to such question. This work builds a methodological intersection between the philosophical and psychoanalytical thought of two authors that have effectively emphasized the issue of the constitution of the subject in the contemporary French reflection: Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan. An in-depth analysis of these authors' theoretical frameworks allows to point out precisely at which level the mechanism of the production of subjectivity has to be investigated nowadays. Both perspectives refuse to rescue the subject, intended as a substantial unit of conscience, in contrast with cognitivist and neuro-biologist <b>leeways</b> of contemporary scientific thought. Rather, they attempt to substantiate a different thinking practice able to identify the emergence of subjectivity in the intersection between practices of subjection and processes of subjectivation. Thanks to the combination of the methodologies developed by Foucault and Lacan, it becomes possible to investigate the epistemic and discursive matrixes for individuals' objectivation and, at the same time, the possible ways of constituting the self implemented by subjects within such a system of determinations. After having analyzed the foundamental relationship between subjection and subjectivation in relation to the constitution of subjectivity, this research will focus on the contemporary working structure of the regimes of power with respect to their discoursive form and link them to the production of well-defined forms of subjectivity. In the background of the devices of individualization produced by the contemporary paradigm of neo-liberal capitalism, I will describe the specific relationship between subject and language that can orient the individual towards potential procedures of ethical and political subjectivation...|$|R

40|$|Inequalities in {{education}} {{are most of}} the time unacceptable perceptions as far as schools system is supposed to be an intergenerational mobility vector. A growing litterature in Economics question the differences among educative schemes and particularly the impact of a student's social background on his/her school results (Wössmann 2004). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the ability of several developed countries to promote equal opportunities. To define the different educative systems, we supported our theory on Mons typology (2004) which define four major types of systems : individualised integration, particularised integration, regular integration and separation. Each education model was represented by a country belonging to O. E. C. D. : Japan and Finland for individualised integration, United Kingdom for particularised integration, Italy for regular integration and Germany for separation model. Concerning the notion of equal opportunities, our analysis area is close to the 'capability approach' from the economist Amartya Sen (1985, 1992) and turns to liberate students possibilities for choosing the school career they are supposed to prefer. An Educative System can be considered as egalitarian as soon as students performances are relatively independent of their sociocultural background. So, the aim is to analyse if educative system make students free from the weight of their social environment and can get a real freedom to reach the level of education they have reasons to value. After having compared the different existing educative systems in developed countries, a multilevel economical model will show the way students are posted to the different schools of countries and so, allow to estimate people <b>leeways.</b> According to our assumptions, the results confirm that educative models in Finland and in United Kingdom produce a large equality in opportunities. At the opposite, in Japan, for whom educative system is similar to Finland, it seems to appear a poor equality in opportunities, the objective for this egalitarian system may be biased by a hard competition period between pupils before their university entrance examination. Furthermore, unexpectedly, the educative system in Germany seems a little more egalitarian than in Italy for whom the educative model does not seem actually satisfying its unique school ambition. Results are implemented from PISA 2003,which is a relevant database since it helps in measuring : -the impact of the student's social and cultural environments on his performance -the variations of performance within each school -the variations of performance between several schools Therefore, it can identify the way students are appointed to the various schools within a country...|$|R
40|$|The MPEG- 2 {{standard}} for video coding is predominant in consumer electronics for DVD players, digital satellite receivers, and TVs today. MPEG- 2 processing puts high demands on audio/video quality, which {{is achieved by}} continuous and synchronized playout without interrupts. At the same time, there are restrictions on the storage media, e. g [...] , limited size of a DVD disc, communication media, e. g., limited bandwidth of the Internet, display devices, e. g., the processing power, memory and battery life of pocket PCs or video mobile phones, and finally the users, i. e., humans ability of perceiving motion. If the available resources are not sufficient to process a full-size MPEG- 2 video, then video stream adaptation must take place. However, this should be done carefully, since in high quality devices, drops in perceived video quality are not tolerated by consumers. We propose real-time methods for resource reservation of MPEG- 2 video stream processing and introduce flexible scheduling mechanisms for video decoding. Our method is a mixed offline and online approach for scheduling of periodic, aperiodic and sporadic tasks, based on slot shifting. We use the offline part of slot shifting to eliminate all types of complex task constraints before the runtime of the system. Then, we propose an online guarantee algorithm for dealing with dynamically arriving tasks. Aperiodic and sporadic tasks are incorporated into the offline schedule by making use of the unused resources and <b>leeways</b> in the schedule. Sporadic tasks are guaranteed offline for the worst-case arrival patterns and scheduled online, where an online algorithm keeps track of arrivals of instances of sporadic tasks to reduce pessimism about future sporadic arrivals and improve response times and acceptance of firm aperiodic tasks. At runtime, our mechanism ensures feasible execution of tasks with complex constraints in the presence of additional tasks or overloads. We use the scheduling and resource reservation mechanism above to flexibly process MPEG- 2 video streams. First, we present results from a study of realistic MPEG- 2 video streams to analyze the validity of common assumptions for software decoding and identify a number of misconceptions. Then, we identify constraints imposed by frame buffer handling and discuss their implications on the decoding architecture and timing. Furthermore, we propose realistic timing constraints demanded by high quality MPEG- 2 software video decoding. Based on these, we present a MPEG- 2 video frame selection algorithm with focus on high video quality perceived by the users, which fully utilize limited resources. Given that not all frames in a stream can be processed, it selects those which will provide the best picture quality while matching the available resources, starting only such decoding, which is guaranteed to be completed. As a final result, we provide a real-time method for flexible scheduling of media processing in resource constrained system. Results from study based on realistic MPEG- 2 video underline the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
