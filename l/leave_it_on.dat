500|$|Their first release, the EP, <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>On,</b> was {{an entirely}} {{independent}} one and {{was launched in}} Whelan's in Dublin. The band collectively provided an amount of cash to record it {{at the start of}} 2005. McGuinness had a job so provided the money, {{with the rest of the}} band paying him back. <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> was released on the band's Delo Records label, with Cottage Records distributing it. Produced by Marc Carolan the four-track EP was released in Ireland in November 2005, entering the Top 30 of the Irish Singles Chart. The single, [...] "Leave it On", went straight to number one in the Irish Singles Chart. Delorentos followed this with a tour which included an appearance at the UK industry show In The City (festival) and they were invited to participate in the 2006 series of RTÉ's annual Other Voices music show. This was followed in May 2006 by another single, [...] "The Rules", which debuted in the Irish Singles Chart at number fourteen and spent a total of three weeks in this chart.|$|E
500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me that you come into this world as you <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E

500|$|Just {{prior to}} this, Delorentos {{had come to}} wider {{attention}} when they represented Ireland at the National Student Music Awards (NSMA) in Dublin on 31 March 2005, where they were chosen as the Best Student Artist in the UK and Ireland. As part of their prize, they received free recording time at the BBC's Maida Vale recording studios and were invited onto the UK television show , on which they confirmed the UK release date of their debut EP <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>On.</b> The band followed this with another Irish tour and appeared on The Cafe in 2006 and 2007. They toured with other more established bands such as Idlewild, Bell X1, Whitey, The Futureheads, Gang of Four and Tapes 'n Tapes in locations such as London, New York City, Chicago and Toronto. Delorentos featured at both Oxegen and Electric Picnic in 2006, becoming the first unsigned act to perform at both festivals. In February 2007, they released the single, [...] "Basis of Everything", to coincide with US dates in New York City {{and a series of}} performances at South by South West.|$|E
500|$|A thirteen-year {{rivalry with}} Nicholls State University {{ended with the}} 2011 {{football}} season. [...] It began in 1998 when the annual football game between the two schools was at first cancelled due to severe flooding in San Marcos, where the game was to be played. [...] The athletic directors and coaches later decided to postpone the game from October to November. [...] To remember those affected by the floods, including some people {{who had died in}} it, a wooden oar was made with each school's colors and initials. [...] The winning school would take possession of the oar for the next year and have the score inscribed on it. [...] This rivalry became known as the Battle for the Paddle. [...] The oar was last traded in 2010 when Nicholls State received it following 47-44 win over Texas State after four overtimes. [...] Prior to the schools' meeting in 2011, Rob Bernardi, the Athletic Director for Nicholls State, said {{that they would not be}} bringing the oar to San Marcos and would <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> display in the Nicholls State athletic offices. [...] Due to Texas State changing conferences, Bernardi said it was unlikely that the schools will face each other in football again and that the rivalry was ending.|$|E

Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, as Radiohead said: [...] "it's our song, let people hear it." [...] In 2009, Prince put the video of the Coachella performance on his official website.|$|E

2500|$|A further British Rail report, from a {{committee}} chaired by Sir David Serpell, {{was published in}} 1983. The Serpell Report made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km. This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the shelf. Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors. This process, known as [...] "sectorisation", led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.|$|E
2500|$|The outcry was instantaneous. The word [...] "grovel" [...] had {{sinister}} connotations for West Indian people, many of {{whom have}} slave ancestry. Moreover, apartheid and the Gleneagles Agreement were prominent issues of the day, so a white South African using the word [...] "grovel" [...] heavily accentuated the faux pas. The West Indian fast bowlers took great delight in adding yards to their run-up when Greig came to the wicket and their supporters took equal delight when his wicket was captured. At times during the series, the West Indies were roundly criticised for their use of short-pitched bowling. To compensate for his unusual height and attempt to combat such bowling, Greig held the bat at shoulder height (rather than <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the ground) as the bowler ran in, thus not using a back swing of the bat. While it helped him to combat the short ball, it left him vulnerable to the yorker (full pitch) and he was bowled quite regularly for a top order batsman. The West Indian bowlers managed to hit Greig's stumps often. Apart from a formidable performance in the fourth Test at Leeds, where he fought back with 116 and 76 not out and shared a big partnership with keeper Alan Knott, Greig scored just 51 runs in seven innings. Worse, his bowling lost penetration and he took only five wickets as England slumped to a 0–3 loss. However, Greig did not lose his sense of humour: playing on his [...] "grovel" [...] comment, he pretended to crawl {{on his hands and knees}} in front of the open stands on the Harleyford Road side of The Oval in the last Test match, delighting the crowds that had previously jeered him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{village of}} Redwater was first namechecked in EastEnders on 21 January 2016, {{and the working}} title of the series was {{revealed}} as Redwater on 26 February 2016. [...] On 13 April 2017, {{the title of the}} series was revealed as Kat & Alfie: Redwater, though it continued to be referred to as Redwater. Richie hoped that the show would continue beyond its first series, saying, [...] "With the storylines we've heard, I'd be very surprised if it wasn't a long runner. That's the plan." [...] On 20 April 2016, it was reported that BBC chiefs were [...] "so impressed" [...] with how filming for Redwater had gone that they had [...] "given the green-light for it to return [...] in extended form in a primetime 9pm slot" [...] and that the [...] "numerous characters [...] all have stories to tell." [...] Treadwell-Collins said {{that he would not be}} working on a second series as he had left the BBC but had spoken to producer Victoria Wharton about it and had [...] " [...] putting plans in place about what would happen next. Throughout the series, we have very carefully laid down secrets and hinted at other characters. The end of this series will feel like a midpoint—not an ending. We <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the mother of all cliffhangers at the end of episode six." [...] On 14 June 2017, the BBC stated that no decision had yet been made for the series to return. On 20 September 2017, it was officially confirmed that Kat & Alfie: Redwater would not return for a second series, with a BBC spokesperson saying, [...] "In order to increase the range of new original drama on BBC One, Kat & Alfie: Redwater won't be returning." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E
