Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby <b>lower</b> <b>inflation,</b> introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{taken by}} the {{government}} to <b>lower</b> <b>inflation</b> were largely defeated by natural disaster. In early 1988, the administration of Daniel José Ortega Saavedra (Sandinista junta coordinator 1979–85, president 1985–90) established an austerity program to <b>lower</b> <b>inflation.</b> Price controls were tightened, and a new currency was introduced. As a result, by August 1988, inflation had dropped to an annual rate of 240 percent. The following month, however, Hurricane Joan cut a path directly across the center of the country. Damage was extensive, and the government's program of large spending to repair the infrastructure destroyed its anti-inflation measures.|$|E

Although eighteen months of austerity measures had <b>lowered</b> <b>inflation</b> to 2.1%, after eighteen months of rising unemployment, stagnation of industrial output and {{a breakdown of the}} Chinese financial system because of debt defaults, the government was forced to loosen the economic screws in the mid-1990s.|$|R

It has been reported that contour tourniquet cuffs occlude blood flow at <b>lower</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures than standard rectangular cuffs of equal width, which may be attributable to better cuff fit and more efficient transmission of pressure to deep tissues. There are two types of contour cuff designs; fixed-contour and variable-contour.|$|E

25|$|Nicaragua's {{economy is}} focused {{primarily}} on the agricultural sector. It is the least developed country in Central America, and the second poorest in the Americas by nominal GDP. In recent years, under the administrations of Daniel Ortega, the Nicaraguan economy has increased dramatically, although {{it has also been}} subject to the global recession. The country's economy actually contracted by 1.5% in 2009, due to decreased export demand in the US and Central American markets, lower commodity prices for key agricultural exports, and low remittance growth, but saw 4.5% growth in 2010 thanks to a recovery in export demand and growth in its tourism industry. Nicaragua's economy continues to post growth, with preliminary indicators showing the Nicaraguan economy growing an additional 5% in 2011. Consumer Price inflation have also curtailed since 2008, when Nicaragua's inflation rate hovered at 19.82%.

25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be <b>lower</b> <b>inflation</b> rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends {{to examine the relationship between}} demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E

40|$|Much static {{research}} on the new Keynesian economics {{is based on the}} distortion caused by monopolistic pricing. When the theory of monopolistic competition is extended to monetary dynamics in an overlapping generations (OLG) model (Otaki 2007, 2009), the underemployment problem is resolved by a proper monetary policy. However, even in the full-employment equilibrium, the market mechanism does not attain the socially optimal allocation. Since the rate of population growth is assumed to be zero, the optimal gross in- flation rate in the model is unity. There is no such coordination motive in a monetary economy, and hence, the inflation rate may exceed unity. The monopolistic power <b>lowers</b> the <b>inflation</b> rate. The prices of the cur- rent goods relative to the future goods increase by virtue of the monopolistic power. This improves the life- time utility because the <b>lowered</b> <b>inflation</b> rate corrects the consumption stream, which is biased toward the current goods...|$|R
