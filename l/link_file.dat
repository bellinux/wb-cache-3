A <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> of the 1982 birth cohort was produced that successfully linked 97 percent of the death records for infants {{who died in a}} nine-State area. The method NCHS uses to create national <b>linked</b> <b>files</b> takes full advantage of two existing data sources: the NCHS fully coded natality and mortality files and State files of matched births and infant deaths. For the nine-State pilot area, NCHS obtained computerized <b>linked</b> <b>files</b> from the States and extracted from them the certificate numbers on matching birth and death records. With the use of these numbers, NCHS selected and linked birth and death statistical records from its final natality and mortality files, thus creating new statistical linked records. The initial match rate of 93. 2 percent for the project's <b>linked</b> record <b>file</b> was increased to 96. 7 percent as a result of efforts by the pilot States to complete the matching of birth and infant death records. Matching in the nine-State <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> appears to be highly accurate, {{based on the results of}} two evaluation studies. In the second stage of the project, now underway, NCHS will continue to evaluate and improve State and national <b>linked</b> <b>files</b> for the four birth cohorts of 1983 - 86.

40|$|Environmental {{science is}} a large field of study that {{requires}} the acquisition of data for decision making in solving environmental issues. Leveraging desktop geographic information systems (GIS) and web-based GIS (WebGIS) systems for assisting in the problem solving processes can benefit both the research community and policy makers for decision making activities. Ensuring interoperability between desktop, web, and server GIS is essential for maximizing access, sharing and manipulation of data. Interoperability is maximized through the adoption of best practices, use of open standards, and utilization of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). While many of the interoperability challenges such as infrastructure, data exchange, and file formats are common between applications, some regions like the Arctic present specific challenges including the need for presenting data {{in one or more}} polar projections. ^ This thesis describes the development and use of the Arctic Research Mapping Application (ARMAP) suite of online interactive maps, web services, and desktop virtual globes ([URL] and several of the interoperability challenges and solutions encountered in development to date. The Arctic Research Logistics Support Service (ARLSS) database is the informational underpinning of ARMAP and has been incorporated in the ARMAP suite. Three case studies are described and demonstrate how the ARMAP suite can be used to improve access to ARLSS data and information for the purpose of facilitating Arctic science and logistic support. The cases presented include the use of: 1) A Keyhole Markup Language (KML) networked <b>link</b> <b>file</b> for Google Earth (GE) which eases the use of Arctic research information in a virtual globe for non-technical GIS users to develop quick maps; 2) A customized Internet Map Server client (ArcIMS), which provides access to many Arctic data sets in a powerful online GIS application with data exploration capabilities in a free web viewer to develop logistic plans for future research; and 3) A customized ArcGIS Explorer (AGX) application that provides users access to Arctic research information in a virtual globe similar to GE while providing GIS query capabilities developed to mimic the ArcIMS application. ^ ARMAP has become a unique science and logistic tool supporting U. S. and international Arctic science by providing users with the ability to access, query, and browse information and data. Avoiding duplication of effort has been a key priority {{in the development of the}} ARMAP applications. The ARMAP suite incorporates best practices that facilitate interoperability such as Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata standards, web services for embedding external data and serving framework layers, and open standards such as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web services. Outcomes of this project include the development and promotion of free desktop and web GIS tools that improve access to and exploration of pertinent information about U. S. Arctic research effort while using best practices for data storage and use developed from a task based analysis. Many of the features and capabilities of ARMAP are expected to greatly enhance the development of an Arctic Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). This project has provided functionality to the research community, logistic providers, public outreach, and program managers for Arctic research and decision making activities. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A large {{fraction}} of our information, {{both in the}} professional and private domains, is stored {{in the form of}} files on our personal comput-ers. When we collaborate with co-workers or meet with friends, mecha-nisms for sharing files and file annotations are frequently required. How-ever, centralized file sharing infrastructures are often not available or complicated to set up, and approaches like peer-to-peer sharing infre-quently provide functionality beyond simple copying of files between ma-chines. In this paper we present a light-weight approach for ad-hoc file sharing based on Linked Data principles. Our system exposes parts of a <b>file</b> system as <b>Linked</b> Data and allows users to interlink and annotate resources in such <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> systems. We further provide a mechanism for mounting multiple such file systems together, and for seamlessly nav-igating them using a common Web browser. As the exposed files and directories become Web resources, they are amenable to a large set of Semantic Web and Linked Data tools. Human and machine users may exploit such <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> systems in ad-hoc data sharing scenarios. They may further add arbitrary annotations to local and remote <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> system resources, which may also be shared among users. Finally, file system objects may be searched based on their extracted metadata and such semantic annotations. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{abstracted}} {{a sample}} of 7, 536 hospital medical records to validate {{the accuracy of the}} coding of obstetric information on 1) birth certificates, 2) a statewide computerized hospital discharge abstract data system, and 3) a <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> merging birth certificates and the hospital abstract data for Washington State deliveries occurring in 1989. Measures of accuracy of coding of delivery method and obstetric procedures varied greatly among the 23 hospitals that participated in the study. Computerized hos-pital discharge data were generally more complete and accurate than were birth cer-tificate data. The <b>linked</b> <b>file</b> was more likely to identify obstetric procedures than was either source alone. For example, only 84. 1 % of cesarean deliveries noted in the hospital charts were identified on birth certificates (range among hospitals, 37 - 100 %). Using the <b>linked</b> <b>file,</b> the authors identified 99. 8 % of cesarean deliveries (range, 97 - 100 %). Linked birth certificate-hospital abstract files may become an excellent source of data for ep-idemiologic and health care studies; however, further training of medical record per-sonnel and standardization of coding are needed {{to improve the quality of}} computerized data on obstetric events.

In addition to the census data, the study collected other documentary materials and involved oral history interviews. An associated qualitative dataset, The Creation and Collapse of an Occupational Community, the Case of Sheerness Naval Dockyard, is available via Qualidata at the University of Essex. Main Topics : Variables Census enumerators data was collected for all dockyard workers and included all information about the individuals (i. e. age, sex, marital status, occupation, birthplace) and most information about their household and family situations. The data is on two separate tapes. On the one known as the unlinked file there is a separate case for each dockyard worker at each census.
