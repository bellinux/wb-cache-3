The aims are the detection and identification of the different sources of damping and their dependence from the damage level. To this end a specially formulated non-linear identification method is proposed, based on a time-varying polynomial approximation of the system dynamics, suitable {{for use in the}} presence of excitations of any form. A minimum condition imposed to the identified dissipated energy leads to the distinction of the linear viscous component from the other damping mechanisms. The estimated values obtained from the experimental tests show a significant influence of the damage level on the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficient.</b> This suggests that, in a non-linear dynamic time-history analysis, the use of Rayleigh damping model with proportionality to the initial stiffness is basically in contrast with experimental evidence and more refined viscous damping models are needed for prediction purpose...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{dissipation}} during {{wave propagation}} in fragmented geomaterials {{can be caused}} by independent movement of fragments leading to energy loss on their impact. By considering a pair of impacting fragments at times much greater than the period of their oscillations, we show that at a large timescale, the dynamics of the pair can be described by a <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> model with <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> expressed through the restitution coefficient representing energy loss on impact. Wave propagation in fragmented geomaterials is also considered at the large timescale assuming that the wavelengths are much larger than the fragment sizes such that the attenuation associated with wave scattering on the fragment interfaces can be neglected. These assumptions lead to the Kelvin–Voigt model of damping during wave propagation, which allows the determination of a dispersion relationship. As the attenuation and dispersion are not related to the rate dependence of rock deformation, but rather to the interaction of fragments, the increased energy dispersion at low frequencies can be seen as an indication of the fragmented nature of the geomaterial and the capacity of the fragments for independent movement...|$|R

40|$|Heerema Marine Contractors is {{constructing}} a new semi-submersible crane vessel, the Sleipnir. Due to low initial stability, semi-submersibles may present significant wave induced resonant motions in heave, roll and pitch. For practical reasons, especially the roll motion {{could play a}} limiting factor for future lift operations of the Sleipnir. In order to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the Sleipnir, model tests in waves have been performed atMaritime Research Institute Netherlands. In the tested sea states low frequent second order roll has been observed. In order to evaluate {{the impact of the}} low frequent motions of the Sleipnir it is important to create an accurate (low frequent) simulation model. The aim of this thesis is to investigate if a low frequency roll motion simulation model, in the frequency and time domain, can be created. It is challenging to predict the low frequent second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements due to two main non-linear phenomenons. In the first place, the (<b>viscous)</b> roll <b>damping</b> is considered to be non-linear. In the second place, the second order wave forces in the vertical plane, which have not been investigated extensively in the past, are non-linear phenomena. A calculation method in order to simulate the low frequency roll motions is created. This simulation method makes use of a first and second order hydrodynamic date base, first and second order moment spectra and a moment transfer function in order to define the roll motion spectrum. In order to implement <b>viscous</b> roll <b>damping</b> in the frequency domain method, a linearization of the roll damping is necessary. First empirical <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> values have been obtained for the three tested sea states. The frequency domain method predicts the roll motion energy in good agreement with the measurements, using the empirical <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> roll <b>damping</b> values, for the three tested sea states. In order to predict the low frequent roll motions for any sea state, a calculation scheme is proposed. In this calculation scheme, a linear roll damping prediction method based on linearization techniques, is incorporated. However, the investigated linearization techniques do not predict the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> in agreement with the measurements. The energy in the rollmotion response spectrumis highly dependent on the amount of added <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> in the calculation. Therefore, it will be hard, due to inaccurate <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> predictions assigned to the linearization techniques, to estimate the low frequency second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements. In the time domain simulations non-linear <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> terms are incorporated by means of a linear and quadratic <b>damping</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Still water decay test simulations show a very good agreement with the measurements when using <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from decay tests. However, the statistics of the simulated model tests are not in exact agreement with statistics of the model tests. Possible causes for this mismatch are discussed. It must be noted that the time domain simulations have been validated with only one sea state. It is recommended to validate the time domain model for more sea states. Although the model tests and simulation methods show significant second order roll motions, which are undesirable for performing a heavy lift, it must be realized that a combination of the tested conditions (very low initial stability, long crested beam waves) will be very rare during a future heavy lift of the Sleipnir. Additionally it is noted, that the tested sea states exceed the typical heavy lift operability limit, used by Heerema.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 57 - 59). Modern turbomachinery design directs towards the ographics. generation or utilization of increasing amounts of power with the minimum engine weight. High performance turbomachinery requires of appropriate means to ensure structural isolation of components and rotor vibration limits with tolerance to sudden imbalance loads due to blade loss events, shock, and maneuver actions. Squeeze film dampers (SFDS) are an effective mean to reduce vibrations and to suppress instabilities in high performance aeroengine systems. The recently developed integral squeeze film dampers (ISFDS) offer several advantages over conventional SFDS such as reduced overall weight and length of the damper structure with less number of parts, accuracy of positioning (centering), and a split segment construction allowing easier assembly, inspection, and retrofit than with any other type of damper. The objective of the experimental program is the identification of the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> of sealed ISFDS from measurements of the imbalance response of a massive rotor supported on two (identical) integral dampers. Experiments are conducted on dampers with end plate seals of known clearance. The amplitudes of synchronous rotor response at the first critical speed, for increasing levels of imbalance, allow the determination of system amplification factors and the Measurements of oil flow rates, impact tests and imbalance response tests demonstrate that end gap seals render a substantial increase in the ISFD <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> and with only a small reduction on the flow through the dampers. The sealed integral dampers genemte <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> larger than two times the test values obtained earlier for open ended dampers. Conventional (cylindrical) sealed SFDS restrict substantially the lubricant through flow and determine minimal increments in the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> because the lubricant viscosity decreases as the operating film temperature raises.
