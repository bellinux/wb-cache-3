40|$|Advance in deep {{learning}} algorithms overshadows their security risk in software implementations. This paper discloses {{a set of}} vulnerabilities in popular deep <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> including Caffe, TensorFlow, and Torch. Contrast to the small code size of {{deep learning}} models, these deep <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> are complex and contain heavy dependencies on numerous open source packages. This paper considers the risks caused by these vulnerabilities by studying their impact on common deep learning applications such as voice recognition and image classifications. By exploiting these framework implementations, attackers can launch denial-of-service attacks that crash or hang a deep learning application, or control-flow hijacking attacks that cause either system compromise or recognition evasions. The goal {{of this paper is}} to draw attention on the software implementations and call for the community effort to improve the security of deep <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Machine {{learning}} is being deployed {{in a growing}} number of applications which demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy query load. However, most machine <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> and systems only address model training and not deployment. In this paper, we introduce Clipper, a general-purpose low-latency prediction serving system. Interposing between end-user applications and a wide range of machine <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks,</b> Clipper introduces a modular architecture to simplify model deployment across frameworks and applications. Furthermore, by introducing caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, Clipper reduces prediction latency and improves prediction throughput, accuracy, and robustness without modifying the underlying machine <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks.</b> We evaluate Clipper on four common machine learning benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to meet the latency, accuracy, and throughput demands of online serving applications. Finally, we compare Clipper to the TensorFlow Serving system and demonstrate that we are able to achieve comparable throughput and latency while enabling model composition and online learning to improve accuracy and render more robust predictions...|$|R
40|$|In this {{deliverable}} D 530. 2 “Tools for the Lessons Learned Framework” {{the overall}} lessons <b>learned</b> <b>framework</b> will be clarified {{based on the}} delivery D 53. 1 “Lessons <b>Learned</b> <b>Framework</b> Concept” and aligned with the deliverable D 52. 1 “Harmonized competence framework”. The Tools for the Lessons <b>Learned</b> <b>Framework</b> {{is a set of}} tools {{that can be used for}} lessons learned activities from the early phases of planning and making observations to the last phases of lessons learned implementation and dissemination of best practice. The LL-tools and the methodologies uses for lessons learned activities need to be adapted to each other and to the organisations that using them. One LL-tool doesn’t fit all organisations or cannot be applied to all lessons learned methods straight way. One methodology will not be suitable for all occasions, organisations or LL-tools. There are a limit number of LL-tools at the commercial market that are suitable and helpful for the crisis management organisations. Some organisations have developed their own LL-tools and some of these tools seems to be really good but the tools are not for sale. Some other organisations provide their LL-tools only together with the service of planning and executing the lessons learned at full-scale exercises. Nevertheless, this Lessons <b>Learned</b> <b>Framework</b> helps users to identify important success factors regarding the usage of LL-tools and enable the users to understand what features that are available at some of the LL-tools. There are no LL-tools that covers the full spectrum the lessons learned process or the large variety of user needs and requirements. The lessons <b>learned</b> <b>framework</b> and the result of the gathered features and requirements for LL-tools can also push some vendors of LL-tools to define a roadmap so their LL-tools are better aligned with the requirements and needs from the end-users...|$|R
25|$|In Machine Learning and Computer Vision, M-Theory is a <b>learning</b> <b>framework</b> {{inspired}} by feed-forward processing in the ventral stream of visual cortex and originally developed for recognition and classification {{of objects in}} visual scenes.

30|$|Another {{important}} aspect, pedagogy, {{which is}} defined as ‘any conscious activity by one person to enhance learning in another’(Mortimore 1999, p. 17), has been mentioned in mobile <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> (Ozdamli 2012). One such pedagogical activity is personalisation, which is a key aspect identified in many mobile <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks.</b> For example, it enables students to self-control their learning process (Kearney et al. 2012) and to control the content (Motiwalla 2007). Also, personalisation of the content, for instance, requires that educators ensure that the assessment feedback is personalised, reflecting individual student contribution. Furthermore, the benefits of personalised and individual feedback have been highlighted in the literature (Ferguson 2011; Taylor and Burke da Silva 2014).

40|$|For a {{seamless}} {{deployment of the}} Internet of Things (IoT), {{there is a need}} for self-organizing solutions to overcome key IoT challenges that include data processing, resource management, coexistence with existing wireless networks, and improved IoT-wide event detection. One of the most promising solutions to address these challenges is via the use of innovative <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> that will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied. For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information, and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices are mapped to different levels of rationality in cognitive hierarchy theory, thus enabling the IoT devices to use different <b>learning</b> <b>frameworks</b> depending on their available resources. Finally, key results on the use of cognitive hierarchy theory in the IoT are presented. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
