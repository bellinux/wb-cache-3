5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of deities, {{and distinct}} iconographies {{have been identified}} for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E

The new ruler made a great processional {{entrance}} on horseback into the city, accompanied by multiple cavalry squadrons, his consort (in an accompanying carriage) and the pealing of <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of church bells. The new Tsar stopped at the Chapel of Our Lady of Iveron, home of the Icon of the Blessed Virgin of Iveron, {{one of the most}} revered icons in Moscow. It was a tradition with Russian Tsars that every entry to the Kremlin be marked by the veneration of this image.|$|E
25|$|The {{continental}} coastline features numerous inlets and fjords, {{from which}} the mountains seem to rise straight up to great elevations; this is, for example, {{the case with the}} Cerro Macá (2,300 meters) near Puerto Aisén. The rest of the land consists of <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of islands forming numerous archipelagos interwoven with sometimes-narrow channels, which provide the main routes of navigation. The grouping of such islands shows that they are in part the summits of a submerged mountain chain, a continuation southward of the Chilean Coast Range. Three groups of these, called Chiloé, Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes, lie North of the Taitao Peninsula.|$|E

25|$|Many other trails {{followed}} the Oregon Trail {{for much of}} its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of California; and the Bozeman Trail to Montana.

In Japanese, the Kuril Islands are known as the Chishima Islands (Kanji: [...] , <b>literally,</b> <b>Thousand</b> Islands Archipelago), {{also known as the}} Kuriru Islands (Katakana: [...] , literally, Kuril Archipelago). Once the Russians reached the islands in the 18th century they found a pseudo-etymology from Russian kurit ("курить" [...] - [...] "to smoke") due to the continual fumes and steam above the islands from volcanoes.|$|R

Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere, {{regional}} {{scenes of}} teenage bands playing R rock were particularly well established {{several years before}} the British Invasion, {{in places such as}} Texas and the Midwest. [...] By 1963 singles by several such bands began appearing on the national charts, including those by the Trashmen, from Minneapolis, and the Rivieras, from South Bend, Indiana. [...] At the same time, in southern California surf bands formed, playing raucous guitar- and saxophone-driven instrumentals. [...] There was a resulting cross-pollination between surf rock, hot rod music, and other influences resulting in an energetic and upbeat style sometimes referred to as frat rock, which can be viewed as an early subgenre of garage rock. [...] It is often associated with many Pacific Northwest acts such as the Kingsmen, and also thrived elsewhere. [...] Writer Neil Campbell commented: [...] "There were <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of rough-and-ready groups performing in local bars and dance halls throughout the US prior to the arrival of the Beatles... he indigenous popular music which functioned in this way... was the protopunk more commonly identified as garage rock".|$|E

2500|$|Companies {{chose to}} support CP/M {{because of its}} large library of software. The Xerox 820 ran the {{operating}} system because [...] "where there are <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of programs written for it, it would be unwise not {{to take advantage of}} it", Xerox said. By 1984 Columbia University used the same source code to build Kermit binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus a generic version. The operating system was described as a [...] "software bus", allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way. Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the escape sequences for control of the screen and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).|$|E
2500|$|The Rathvon audio {{recollections}} {{were known}} by an extremely {{small circle of}} individuals {{from the time of}} their recording in 1938.

He, himself, never promoted them, or even promoted the idea that he had made them nor sold them. [...] He seems to have wanted to preserve them for posterity and he died the following year, 1939. As {{tens of thousands of people}} heard the Gettysburg address and even as late as 1900, significant people in Lincoln's life, the Civil War Federal Army and even Lincoln's private secretary, John Hay, were still very active in government as Secretary of State under McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, for most of Rathvon's life, there were <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of witnesses to the event. Consequently, in the years leading up to the 1930s, it probably didn't occur to him to attempt to preserve his recollections for posterity. [...] But with improvements in and access to the recording technology by the late 30s, and his advancing age, it was no surprise, that making a recording happened only a year before his death. Clearly, his position as one of five managers of his church kept him fully occupied right up to his death.|$|E

This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles, Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed. The vigor of the response from the LAPD, initially intended to prevent the demonstrators from storming the hotel where Johnson was speaking, was to a certain extent based on exaggerated reports from undercover agents which had infiltrated the organizations sponsoring the protest. [...] "Unresisting demonstrators were beaten – some in front of <b>literally</b> <b>thousands</b> of witnesses – without even the pretext of and attempt to make an arrest." [...] A crowd the Los Angeles Times reports at 10,000 clashed with 500 riot police outside President Johnson's fundraiser at the Century City Plaza Hotel. Expecting only 1,000 or 2,000 protesters, the LAPD field commander later told reporters he had been 'astounded' by the size of the demonstration. [...] "Where did all those people come from? I asked myself." [...] Scores were injured, including many peaceful middle-class protestors. Some sources put the crowd as high as 15,000 and noted that the police attacked the marchers with nightsticks to disperse the crowd.
