50|$|The Hamburger Wagon {{is a small}} wagon, {{large enough}} for only two people to work side by side; one cooks while the other one prepares the buns and handles the money. The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil in a <b>large</b> <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper. The burgers have a crispness on the outside due to being deep fried.|$|E

The Chicken Festival {{is also home}} to the world's <b>largest</b> <b>skillet,</b> which {{measures}} 10 feet, 6 inches in diameter; 8 inches deep; 8 foot handle; and weighs 700 pounds total. The skillet cooks over 7000 pieces of chicken {{by the end of the}} weekend which requires 300 gallons of cooking oil. [...] Vendor booths also line main street selling a wide variety of different goods to the public.|$|R
5000|$|London {{is a home}} rule-class city in Laurel County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is {{the seat}} of its county. [...] The {{population}} was 7,993 {{at the time of}} the 2010 U.S. census. London, Kentucky, is the second-largest city named London in the United States and the fourth-largest in the world. It is recognized as one of the country's micropolitan statistical areas, smaller cities which nevertheless function as significant economic hubs. Of the seventeen micropolitan areas in Kentucky, London is the largest; the London micropolitan area's 2010 Census population was [...] London is also home to the annual World Chicken Festival that celebrates the life of Colonel Sanders and features the world's <b>largest</b> <b>skillet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A hoard of {{gold and}} silver objects was found in 1812, {{supposedly}} near Backworth and, according to Haverfield, was sold to a Newcastle silversmith. He resold [...] "all, or nearly all" [...] to Mr. J. Brumell, a Newcastle collector, from whom most of the objects passed in 1850 to the British Museum. The hoard consisted of: a silver skillet in which were a pair of silver-gilt trumpet brooches, one silver and five gold rings, one gold bracelet, two gold chains with wheel-shaped pendant, and a crescent attached, three silver spoons, another silver skillet, 280+ Roman denarii, and two first brass coins of Antoninus Pius. A white bronze mirror {{had served as a}} cover. The date of deposition is thought likely to be A.D. 140. The <b>larger</b> <b>skillet</b> and one of the gold rings each have an inscription, a dedication to the mother-goddesses. This list does not wholly accord with Haverfield's: in particular he suggests that an oval silver dish 18 inches long and 2 pieces of a silver bridle bit never reached the British Museum.|$|R
40|$|Ah, an {{invitation}} to tell stories, even if the audience is not quite captive … (usual FDA-like disclaimer: I apologize in advance for any unintentional insult) If was dark when I arrived in Iceland, one January morning in 2004. My host (my 2 nd PhD student) Gunnar Stefansson took me {{from the airport to}} the apartment, and went skiing in the Alps with his family (slight exaggeration). The next day, it snowed. To forage for food, I used a <b>large</b> cast iron <b>skillet</b> to dig myself out of the apartment. I went to Iceland as a Fulbright Scholar. Some Fulbright Scholars go there to paint, some go there to write. As a mere statistician, I went there to help University of Iceland to develop a Statistics curriculum. But, secretly, I hoped to connect with scientists working on genomics in Iceland. I had noticed much of the reported findings in bioinformatics do not seem reproducible. Is the promised pot of gold {{at the end of the}} –omics rainbow a myth? (see Fig. 1) Iceland is technologically advanced, especially in the genomics area. The company called deCODE Genetics is in the news all the time. Perhaps I can find the answer in Iceland...|$|R
