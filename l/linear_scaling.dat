Natural and engineering surfaces typically exhibit roughness features, known as aperities, across a broad range of length scales down to the molecular level, with surface structures exhibiting self affinity, also known as surface fractality. It is recognized that the self affine structure of surfaces is the origin of the <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> of true contact area with applied pressure [...] Assuming a model of shearing welded contacts, this linearity between contact area and pressure can also be considered the origin of the [...] linearity of the relationship between static friction and applied normal force.|$|E

Similar to nVidia's SLI and ATI's Crossfire-technologies, Hydra allows linking several video cards together producing a single output and higher performance. Unlike SLI and CrossFire however, Hydra allows video cards from different chip manufactures to be linked together. Lucid claims it can do so with near to <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> of performance, i.e. two video cards equals twice the performance.

50|$|The present {{definition}} of TT is a <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), {{which is the}} proper time of a notional observer who is infinitely far away (so not affected by gravitational time dilation) and at rest relative to Earth.

The comparison of the observer's clock against TT depends on the observer's altitude: they will match on the geoid, and clocks at higher altitude tick slightly faster.|$|E

TT was defined to be a <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the SI second on the geoid (Earth surface at mean sea level).

TDB is now (since 2006) defined as a <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> of Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB). A feature that distinguishes TDB from TCB is that TDB, when observed from the Earth's surface, has a difference from Terrestrial Time (TT) that is about as small as can be practically arranged with consistent definition: the differences are mainly periodic, and overall will remain at less than 2 milliseconds for several millennia.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} two practical {{properties of}} hierarchical clustering methods for (possibly asymmetric) network data: excisiveness and <b>linear</b> <b>scale</b> preservation. The latter enforces imperviousness {{to change in}} units of measure whereas the former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset. Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i. e. a generative model for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both excisiveness and <b>linear</b> <b>scale</b> preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we show that all excisive and <b>linear</b> <b>scale</b> preserving methods can be factored into two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by {{the application of a}} canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization can be used to show stability of excisive and <b>linear</b> <b>scale</b> preserving methods in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output...|$|R
