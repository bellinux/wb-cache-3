25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E
2500|$|... "First of all I was {{attracted}} to the songs, because I thought that he painted great pictures in his lyrics, particularly for someone {{who had not been}} around the typical Music Row co-writes. I thought that he sang very well too. But more than anything {{there was a kind of}} this ‘I-will-do-it’ <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> - I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} James, {{when he joined}} Peter on the tenth tee, that the latter's manner was strange. He was pale. There was a curious <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
