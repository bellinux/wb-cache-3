40|$|Objectives Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a leading}} cause of activity limitations. The knee OA population is likely to consist of subgroups. The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of activity limitations in patients with early symptomatic knee OA and to describe characteristics of these subgroups. Methods Follow-up data over a period of 5 years of 697 participants with early symptomatic knee OA from the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) were used. Activity limitations were measured yearly with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Latent class growth analyses identified homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of activity limitations. Multivariable regression analyses examined differences in characteristics between the subgroups. Results Three subgroups were identified. Participants in Subgroup 1 (?egood outcome?f; n= 330) developed or displayed slight activity <b>limitations</b> <b>over</b> time. Participants in Subgroup 2 (?emoderate outcome?f; n= 257) developed or displayed moderate activity <b>limitations</b> <b>over</b> time. Participants in subgroup 3 (?epoor outcome?f; n= 110) developed or displayed severe activity <b>limitations</b> <b>over</b> time. Compared with the ?egood outcome?f subgroup, the ?emoderate outcome?f and ?epoor outcome?f subgroups were characterised by: younger age, higher body mass index, greater pain, bony tenderness, reduced knee flexion, hip pain, osteophytosis,. 3 comorbidities, lower vitality or avoidance of activities. Conclusions Based on the 5 -year course of activity limitations, we identified homogeneous subgroups of knee OA patients with good, moderate or poor outcome. Characteristics of these subgroups were consistent with existing knowledge on prognostic factors regarding activity limitations, which supports the validity of this classification...|$|R

Our study highlights the need for large-scale inter regional time series data on human-driven shift in elemental stoichiometry for predicting long-term changes in ecosystem attributes and associated feedbacks in river ecosystems.|$|E

Results: Net of demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status, increased neighborhood disorder was associated with lower odds of recovery. However, both psychosocial indicators and physical activity were significant individual partial mediators, which suggest neighborhood disorder influences recovery from physical impairment via psychosocial processes and barriers to physical activity.

40|$|Matching logic {{has been}} {{recently}} proposed {{as an alternative}} program verification approach. Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific proof system {{that needs to be}} proved sound for each language separately, matching logic provides a language-independent and sound proof system that directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms. Matching logic thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates the need for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason about programs, and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs. What is not clear, however, is whether matching logic is as powerful as Hoare logic. This paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare logic proof derivations into equivalent matching logic proof derivations. The presented technique has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching logic has no theoretical <b>limitation</b> <b>over</b> Hoare logic; and second, it provides a new approach to prove Hoare logics sound. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|E
