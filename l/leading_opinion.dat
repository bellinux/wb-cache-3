40|$|Transportation {{accounts}} for a large and growing part of carbon dioxide emissions. With an increasing vehicle fleet worldwide private car use is becoming an acute problem in need of urgent attention and action. Policy interference and cleaner cars are not enough; alternative fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles need to be adopted by consumers as well. Previous research on pro-environmental consumer behavior and sustainable consumption has proven the importance of norms and pro-environmental attitudes. However, little {{research has focused on}} understanding interpersonal influence found influential in consumer behavior research relating to innovation adoption. Consumer <b>opinion</b> <b>leading</b> and <b>opinion</b> seeking are two such interpersonal influence attitudinal constructs that have not been empirically analyzed in relation to sustainable consumption and alternative fuel vehicles. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the influence of a set of attitudinal constructs on electric and flexfuel vehicle adoption: personal norms, social norms, ecological attitudes, <b>opinion</b> <b>leading,</b> and <b>opinion</b> seeking. Data from a questionnaire survey on three groups of electric vehicle adopters and non-adopters is used (N= 1, 192). The results confirm the importance of personal norms, <b>opinion</b> <b>leading</b> and <b>opinion</b> seeking in the three groups also when controlling for socio-demographic factors. The main contribution {{of this study is that}} it shows the importance of both interpersonal influence and attitudinal factors as drivers for eco-innovation adoption. The study also contributes in showing that electric vehicle and flexfuel vehicle adopters differ in relation to non-adopters on several factors. USBESDA</p...|$|R

50|$|There {{are some}} {{characteristics}} of Chinese culture that influence its way of consumption and {{could explain the}} perception of Internet celebrities, according to that cultural values are considered as determinants of attitudes and behaviors: The first feature of Chinese society is the collective nature. The  Chinese  will  adhere  more  easily  to  the  standards  of  group  than  people  in individualistic societies.  The second feature is Polychronic, the people in a polychronic culture are enjoying social harmony and in general emphasizing relationships more than tasks.  According to the research cited “online social interaction is important in a collectivistic culture such as China. In fact, culture may be the strongest determinant factor of differences in customer online social networking and online shopping behavior across cultures (Pookulangara and Koesler, 2011 and Brandtzaeg, 2010). Since people holding these cultural values in general rely more on word-of-mouth from friends, family and expert opinions, and {{they are more likely}} to communicate and share information on social media, they also tend to find experts in order to earn <b>leading</b> <b>opinion</b> advice for important decision making and emotional support (Ji et al., 2010)”.   These characteristics give force to the role of opinion leaders who have a significant number of followers (like celebrities online), and who may bring an influence on a brand.|$|E
