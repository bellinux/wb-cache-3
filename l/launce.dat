Produced {{and directed by}} Raymond Raikes, it starred John Westbrook as Valentine, Charles Hodgson as Proteus, Caroline Leigh as Silvia, Perlita Neilson as Julia, and Frankie Howerd as <b>Launce.</b> BBC Third Programme aired another full production of the play in 1968, produced and directed by R.D. Smith and starring Denys Hawthorne as Valentine, Michael N. Harbour as Proteus, Judi Dench as Julia and Kate Coleridge as Silvia.|$|E
25|$|Ten years later, in 1970, Robin Phillips' RSC {{production}} starred Peter Egan as Valentine, Ian Richardson as Proteus, Helen Mirren as Julia, Estelle Kohler as Silvia, and Patrick Stewart as <b>Launce.</b> This production {{concentrated on}} the issues of friendship and treachery, and set the play in a decadent world of social elitism. Valentine and Proteus were presented as aristocratic students, the Duke was a Don, and Eglamour an old scout master. On the other hand, the poverty-stricken outlaws were dressed in animal skins.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable 20th-century {{production}} was Peter Hall's 1960 production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Set in a late medieval milieu, the play starred Denholm Elliott as Valentine, Derek Godfrey as Proteus, Susan Maryott as Silvia, Frances Cuka as Julia, and featured a much lauded performance by Patrick Wymark as <b>Launce.</b> Hall had only recently been appointed as Artistic Director of the RSC, and, somewhat unexpectedly, he chose Two Gentlemen as his inaugural production, billed as the opening show in a re-examination {{of the development of}} Shakespearean comedy.|$|E

25|$|In his 2008 {{edition of}} the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren argues that the play is the oldest {{surviving}} piece of Shakespearean literature, suggesting a date of composition as somewhere between 1587 and 1591. He hypothesizes that the play was perhaps written before Shakespeare came to London, with an idea towards using the famous comic actor Richard Tarlton {{in the role of}} <b>Launce</b> (this theory {{stems from the fact that}} Tarlton had performed several extremely popular and well known scenes with dogs). However, Tarlton died in September 1588, and Warren notes several passages in Two Gentlemen which seem to borrow from John Lyly's Midas, which wasn't written until at least late-1589. As such, Warren acknowledges that 1590/1591 is most likely the correct date of composition.|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin Victor rewrote {{the play}} for {{performance}} in 1762 (the earliest recorded performance {{we have of}} the play), at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. Starring Richard Yates as <b>Launce,</b> his wife, Mary Ann Yates as Julia and Elizabeth Pope as Silvia, Victor brought all of the Verona scenes together, removed Valentine's 'gift' of Silvia to Proteus and increased the roles of <b>Launce</b> and Crab (especially during the outlaw scenes, where both characters are intimately involved in the action). He also switched the emphasis of the play away from the love-friendship dichotomy and instead focused {{on the issues of}} fidelity, with the last line of the play altered to, [...] "Lovers must be faithful to be bless'd." [...] This necessitated rewriting Valentine as a near flawless protagonist who represents such faithfulness, and Proteus as a traditional villain, who doesn't care for such notions. The two are not presented as old friends, but simply as acquaintances. Thurio was also rewritten as a harmless, but lovable fool, not unlike <b>Launce</b> and Speed. Although not a major success (the play initially ran for only six performances), it was still being staged as late as 1895.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the cynicism and mockery as regards conventional lovers, however, comes from <b>Launce</b> and Speed, who serve as foils for the two protagonists, and [...] "supply a mundane view of the idealistic flights of fancy indulged in by Proteus and Valentine." [...] Several times in the play, after either Valentine or Proteus has made an eloquent speech about love, Shakespeare introduces either <b>Launce</b> or Speed (or both), whose more mundane concerns serve to undercut what has just been said, thus exposing Proteus and Valentine to mockery. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, as Valentine and Silvia engage {{in a game of}} flirtation, hinting at their love for one another, Speed provides constant asides which serve to directly mock the couple; ...|$|E

2500|$|Language is {{of primary}} {{importance}} in the play insofar as Valentine and Proteus speak in blank verse, but <b>Launce</b> and Speed speak (for the most part) in prose. More specifically, the actual content {{of many of the}} speeches serve to illustrate the pompousness of Valentine and Proteus' exalted outlook, and the more realistic and practical outlook of the servants. This is most apparent in Act 3, Scene 1. Valentine has just given a lengthy speech lamenting his banishment and musing on how he cannot possibly survive without Silvia; [...] "Except I be by Silvia in the night/There is no music in the nightingale./Unless I look on Silvia in the day/There is no day for me to look upon" [...] (ll.178–181). However, when <b>Launce</b> enters only a few lines later, he announces that he too is in love, and proceeds to outline, along with Speed, all of his betrothed's positives ("She brews good ale"; [...] "She can knit"; [...] "She can wash and scour"), and negatives ("She hath a sweet mouth"; [...] "She doth talk in her sleep"; [...] "She is slow in words"). After weighing his options, <b>Launce</b> decides that the woman's most important quality is that [...] "she hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults" [...] (ll.343–344). He announces that her wealth [...] "makes the faults gracious" [...] (l.356), and chooses for that reason to wed her. This purely materialistic reasoning, as revealed in the form of language, is {{in stark contrast to the}} more spiritual and idealised love espoused by Valentine earlier in the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{important}} to Shakespeare {{in the composition}} of the play was John Lyly's Euphues, The Anatomy of Wit, published in 1578. Like The Governor, Euphues presents two close friends who are inseparable until a woman comes between them, and, like both The Governor and Two Gentlemen, the story concludes with one friend sacrificing the woman so as to save the friendship. However, as Geoffrey Bullough argues [...] "Shakespeare's debt to Lyly was probably one of technique more than matter." [...] Lyly's Midas may also have influenced the scene where <b>Launce</b> and Speed run through the milkmaid's virtues and defects, as it contains a very similar scene between Lucio and Petulus.|$|E

2500|$|The Two Gentlemen of Verona is {{a comedy}} by William Shakespeare, {{believed}} to have been written between 1589 and 1593. It is considered by some to be Shakespeare's first play, and is often seen as showing his first tentative steps in laying out some of the themes and motifs with which he would later deal in more detail; for example, it is the first of his plays in which a heroine dresses as a boy. The play deals with the themes of friendship and infidelity, the conflict between friendship and love, and the foolish behaviour of people in love. The highlight of the play is considered by some to be <b>Launce,</b> the clownish servant of Proteus, and his dog Crab, to whom [...] "the most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon" [...] has been attributed.|$|E

Because this Achon was darted with such violence, as it would cleave the Shield, and compell the Maister thereof to hold down his arm, and being so discovered, as naked or unarmed; it made way for the sooner surprizing of him. It seemeth, that this weapon was proper and particuler to the French Souldior, as well him on foote, as on horsebacke. For this cause they called it Franciscus. Francisca, securis oblonga, quam Franci librabant in Hostes. For the Horseman, beside his shield and Francisca (Armes common, as wee have said, to the Footman), had also the Lance, which being broken, and serving to no further effect, he laid hand on his Francisca, as we learn the use of that weapon in the Archbishop of Tours, his second book, and twenty-seventh chapter." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{regards the}} {{resources}} which Shakespeare had at his disposal, {{it is to}} be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up. Even now it is difficult to produce such a play as the Comedy of Errors; and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry's brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing Twelfth Night adequately performed. Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare's on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing- master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production. For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each character. 'Racine abhorre la realite,' says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; 'il ne daigne pas s'occuper de son costume. Si l'on s'en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu d'un sceptre et Achille d'une epee.' But with Shakespeare it is very different. He gives us directions about the costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in Macbeth, and the apothecary in Romeo and Juliet, several elaborate descriptions of his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which Petruchio is to be married. Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt. The children who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green--a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were--and in white, with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton. Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and <b>Launce</b> has holes in his boots. The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in mourning beside her. The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue. We know the patterns on the Dauphin's armour and the Pucelle's sword, the crest on Warwick's helmet and the colour of Bardolph's nose. Portia has golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek's hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won't curl at all. Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces. Lear has a white beard, Hamlet's father a grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his {{in the course of the}} play. Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on. There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an ass's head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband and his wife's milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.|$|E
