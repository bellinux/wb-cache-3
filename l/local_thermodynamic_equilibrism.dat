40|$|Abstract Characterization of {{high power}} plasma devices and {{processes}} requires the direct measurement of heavy particle temperature, electron temperature, electron number density, plasma velocity, and composition. Traditional diagnostic techniques, such as emission spectroscopy, which {{rely on the}} assumption of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium are questionable at best for high velocity flow fields. Because of nonequilibrium and demixing effects, direct measurements which do not rely on assumptions of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium or composition are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recently {{proposed}} {{models of}} nonequilibrium systems use non interacting particle systems, hence cannot possess {{the property of}} <b>Local</b> <b>Thermodynamic</b> Equilibrium. The theories built around these models lead {{to the conclusion that}} the development of singular phase space distributions in chaotic dynamical systems constitute the fundamental mechanism at the origin of thermodynamic entropy production. We argue that this is not the case, and that the laws of Irreversible Thermodynamics only hold in the presence of <b>Local</b> <b>Thermodynamic</b> Equilibrium...|$|R
2500|$|The {{equality}} of absorptivity and emissivity here demonstrated is specific for thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature [...] {{and is in}} general not to be expected to hold when conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium do not hold. The emissivity and absorptivity are each separately properties of the molecules of the material but they depend differently upon the distributions of states of molecular excitation on the occasion, because of a phenomenon known as [...] "stimulated emission", that was discovered by Einstein. On occasions when the material is in thermodynamic equilibrium or in a state known as <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, the emissivity and absorptivity become equal. Very strong incident radiation or other factors can disrupt <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium or <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. <b>Local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium in a gas means that molecular collisions far outweigh light emission and absorption in determining the distributions of states of molecular excitation.|$|R
50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{distinguish}} between global and <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. In thermodynamics, exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by intensive parameters. As an example, temperature controls heat exchanges. Global thermodynamic equilibrium (GTE) means that those intensive parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system, while <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium (LTE) means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any point, one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{generally}} covariant formulation of conformal higher-order viscoelastic fluid mechanics with strain {{allowed to take}} arbitrarily large values. We give a general prescription to determine the dynamics of a relativistic viscoelastic fluid in a way consistent with the hypothesis of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics. We then elaborately study the transient time scales at which the strain almost relaxes and becomes proportional to the gradients of velocity. We particularly show that a conformal second-order fluid with all possible parameters in the constitutive equations can be obtained without breaking the hypothesis of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, if the conformal fluid {{is defined as the}} long time limit of a conformal second-order viscoelastic system. We also discuss how <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium could be understood {{in the context of the}} fluid/gravity correspondence.

50|$|One {{can think}} here of two 'relaxation times' {{separated}} {{by order of}} magnitude. The longer relaxation {{time is of the}} order of magnitude of times taken for the macroscopic dynamical structure of the system to change. The shorter is of the order of magnitude of times taken for a single 'cell' to reach <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. If these two relaxation times are not well separated, then the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamical concept of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium loses its meaning and other approaches have to be proposed, see for instance Extended irreversible thermodynamics. For example, in the atmosphere, the speed of sound is much greater than the wind speed; this favours the idea of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium of matter for atmospheric heat transfer studies at altitudes below about 60 km where sound propagates, but not above 100 km, where, because of the paucity of intermolecular collisions, sound does not propagate.|$|R
50|$|Two {{bodies in}} {{radiative}} exchange equilibrium, each {{in its own}} <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, have the same temperature and their radiative exchange complies with the Stokes-Helmholtz reciprocity principle.|$|R
50|$|In EIT, {{the idea}} of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} is abandoned. In contrast with CIT, the field equations of EIT are hyperbolic circumventing the paradox of signals moving at infinite velocity.|$|R
25|$|Thus, when <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} {{prevails in}} a body, temperature {{can be regarded}} as a spatially varying local property in that body, and this is because temperature is an intensive variable.|$|R
40|$|We present two {{approaches}} to the description of nonequilibrium radiation. The first approach is based on information statistical theory, whereas the second one {{is based on the}} hypothesis of radiative <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium (RLTE). Both methods are applied to describe the radiation inside an infinite medium where a uniform temperature gradient has been established. The absorption coefficient is allowed to be frequency dependent. It is found that both approaches cannot be consistent beyond the first-order approximation. We argue that this shows the limitations of existing models of radiative transfer based on information theory. KEY WORDS: equilibrium.

40|$|The {{essential}} feature underlying abundance {{analysis is}} the assumption that <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium prevails in a stellar atmosphere - i. e., that all relevant distribution functions, except that for the photons themselves, are thermal and determined by the local temperature. It is pointed out that the blanket assumption of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium in stellar atmospheres is a fundamental weakness. The assumption can only be valid if collisional processes are dominant in bringing about transitions between the excitation states of an atom. It has, however, been shown that the density in a stellar atmosphere is so low that, on the contrary, radiative processes are predominant...|$|R
50|$|The {{scope of}} present-day non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} {{does not cover}} all physical processes. A condition for the validity of many studies in non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter is that they deal with {{what is known as}} <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium.|$|R
25|$|In {{the cases}} of {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium and of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, but for other cases, (e.g. lasers) the calculation is more complicated.|$|R
25|$|It {{makes good}} sense, for example, to say of the {{extensive}} variable , or {{of the extensive}} variable , {{that it has a}} density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but {{it makes no sense to}} speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|When {{there is}} enough matter in a region to allow {{molecular}} collisions to occur very much more often than creation or annihilation of photons, for radiation one speaks of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium. In this case, Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative absorptivity and emissivity holds.|$|R
40|$|Case’s {{method of}} {{singular}} normal modes {{is used to}} obtain an exact solution to the equations of radiative transfer in the “uniform ” or “random ” picket fence model assuming <b>Local</b> <b>Thermodynamic</b> Equilibrium. Completeness and orthogonality theorems are proved, and explicit results are obtained for the extrapolated endpoint, the temperature distribution, and law of darkening for the Milne problem. In addition, the method for solving other half-space problems is sketched. The case when the determinant of the “transfer matrix” does not vanish (corresponding to radiative transfer without Complete <b>Local</b> <b>Thermodynamic</b> Equilibrium or the neutron transport problem) is also discussed. Full range completeness and orthogonality theorems are presented for this case; however, no convenient form for the half-range case has been found. I...|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} {{of matter}} (see also Keizer (1987) means that conceptually, for study and analysis, {{the system can}} be spatially and temporally divided into 'cells' or 'micro-phases' of small (infinitesimal) size, in which classical thermodynamical equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation. These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent; and in the boundary layers of a star, where radiation is passing energy to space; and for interacting fermions at very low temperature, where dissipative processes become ineffective. When these 'cells' are defined, one admits that matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous 'cells', slowly enough to leave the 'cells' in their respective individual <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibria with respect to intensive variables.|$|R

40|$|Conditions for {{thermodynamic}} {{stability of}} asymptotically anti-de Sitter rotating black holes in D-dimensions are determined. <b>Local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> stability requires not only positivity {{conditions on the}} specific heat and the moment of inertia tensor {{but it is also}} necessary that the adiabatic compressibility be positive. It is shown that, {{in the absence of a}} cosmological constant, neither rotation nor charge is sufficient to ensure full <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> stability of a black hole. Thermodynamic stability properties of anti-de Sitter Myers-Perry black holes are investigated for both singly spinning and multi-spinning black holes. Simple expressions are obtained for the specific heat and moment of inertia tensor in any dimension. An analytic expression is obtained for the boundary of the region of parameter space in which such space-times are thermodynamically stable. Comment: 30 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|Experiments {{show that}} {{macroscopic}} systems in a stationary nonequilibrium state exhibit long range correlations of the <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> variables. In previous papers {{we proposed a}} Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the nonequilibrium free energy as a basic principle of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We show here how an equation for the two point correlations {{can be derived from}} the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for arbitrary transport coefficients for dynamics with both external fields and boundary reservoirs. In contrast with fluctuating hydrodynamics, this approach can be used to derive equations for correlations of any order. Generically, the solutions of the equation for the correlation functions are non-trivial and show that long range correlations are indeed a common feature of nonequilibrium systems. Finally, we establish a criterion to determine whether the <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> variables are positively or negatively correlated in terms of properties of the transport coefficients.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{review of the}} numerical modeling of inductively coupled plasma flows under <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium and under chemical non-equilibrium. First, the physico-chemical models are described, i. e. the thermodynamics, transport phenomena and chemical kinetics models. Particular attention {{is given to the}} correct modelling of ambipolar diffusion in multi-component chemical non-equilibrium plasmas. Then, the numerical aspects are discussed, i. e. the space discretization and iterative solution strategies. Finally, computed results are presented for the flow, temperature and chemical concentration fields in an air inductively coupled plasma torch. Calculations are performed assuming <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium and under chemical non-equilibrium, where two different finite-rate chemistry models are used. Besides important non-equilibrium effects, we observe significant demixing of oxygen and nitrogen nuclei, which occurs due to diffusion regardless of the degree of non-equilibrium in the plasma...|$|R
40|$|Simplification of astrophysical {{calculations}} can {{be achieved}} by invoking the condition of <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium; however, recent investigations suggest that this assumption may not be valid for certain astrophysical regions. To examine the effects of multiquantum translation to vibration transitions in expanding circumstellar envelopes, vibrational populations of the lowest 20 levels of CO have been calculated as a function of pressure and radiation density for H atom-CO collisions. Significant departure from <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium is indicated, which implies lower dissociation rates for molecular components and a subsequent enhancement in the rate of grain formation by many orders of magnitude. Stabilization of intermediate species before they can dissociate may facilitate the formation of refractory grain cores in very hot, dilute outflows.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of stationary non-equilibrium systems, some very simple, like a system confined between two thermostats at different temperatures or the ordinary Couette flow, a fluid enclosed between two flat walls moving in opposite directions and defining non-equilibrium conditions at the walls. Laser action is also a non-equilibrium process, but it depends on departure from <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium and is thus {{beyond the scope of}} classical irreversible thermodynamics; here a strong temperature difference is maintained between two molecular degrees of freedom (with molecular laser, vibrational and rotational molecular motion), the requirement for two component 'temperatures' in the one small region of space, precluding <b>local</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> equilibrium, which demands that only one temperature be needed. Damping of acoustic perturbations or shock waves are non-stationary non-equilibrium processes. Driven complex fluids, turbulent systems and glasses are other examples of non-equilibrium systems.|$|R
