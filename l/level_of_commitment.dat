25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to a {{personal}} goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia tend to feel more committed to their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E

This hypothesis was confirmed in 8 studies.

25|$|Arguably {{the mission}} to Cambodia {{represented}} {{a significant change in}} Australian thinking towards peacekeeping, and its <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Previously, although a frequent contributor to UN operations, Australia had contributed small numbers of individual personnel to fill technical positions (e.g. signals, engineers or medical personnel) or as observers, however in Cambodia the ADF deployed a significant sized force, albeit again providing higher level technically qualified personnel and support staff, rather than combat troops. This approach however, placed significant strain on the ADF, with the mission denuding it of the bulk of its communications specialists. Subsequently Australia became increasingly involved in UN peacekeeping operations throughout the mid-1990s, deploying significant forces—including combat troops—to Somalia and Rwanda, and later still to East Timor.|$|E

25|$|After {{evaluating}} AA's {{literature and}} observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil {{found that for}} an AA member to remain sober a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by {{a change in the}} member's worldview. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension {{is an integral part of}} AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.|$|E
