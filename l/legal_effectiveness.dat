The SPD re-introduced and overhauled the Bismarckian welfare state, providing protection for the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the aged, and the young. The “Decree on Collective Agreements, Workers’ and Employees’ Committees, and the Settlement of Labour Disputes” of December 1918 boosted the <b>legal</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of collective bargaining contracts, while a number of measures were carried out to assist veterans, including the Decree on Social Provision for Disabled Veterans and Surviving Dependents of February 1919 and the Compensation Law for Re-enlisted Men and Officers of September 1919. The War Victims’ Benefits Law of May 1920 introduced a more generous war-disability system than had existed in the past. This new piece of legislation took into account all grievances voiced during the war and, for the first time in social legislation in Germany, considered child maintenance in calculating widows’ pensions.|$|E

40|$|The main {{question}} of this PhD thesis is whether for legal and fiscal service providers, the Dutch anti-money laundering reporting duty {{that is based}} on the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act[1] (hereafter: Wwft) and its enforcement meet the principles of legal certainty, <b>legal</b> privilege, <b>effectiveness</b> and equivalence. This study starts with an introductory chapter and has four subsequent parts: the normative framework (Part I), the anti-money laundering reporting duty (Part II), enforcement (Part III) and conclusions and recommendations (Part IV). Part I Chapters 2 and 3 contain the normative framework. These chapters describe legal certainty, <b>legal</b> privilege, <b>effectiveness</b> and equivalence as principles of good enforcement. Chapter 3 describes legal privilege in more detail and studies {{the extent to which the}} confidential relationship between practising lawyers (advocaten) and their clients, is protected in case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the European Court of Justice and the Dutch Hoge Raad. Part II Chapter 4 shows that the scope of the Money Laundering Directive has been substantially extended over time. Chapter 5 analyses the implementation of the anti-money laundering reporting duty and the legal-privilege exemption that are based on the Third Money Laundering Directive for legal and fiscal service providers in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and England and Wales. Chapter 6 analyses how the legal-privilege exemption of the Third Money Laundering Directive should be interpreted with regard to practising lawyers, civil-law notaries, accountants and other legal and fiscal service providers, in order to comply with the criteria of protection of <b>legal</b> privilege, <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>legal</b> certainty and equivalence. Chapter 7 addresses a number of obscurities regarding the content and scope of the Wwft reporting duty for legal and fiscal service providers. Part III Chapter 8 is an introduction, offering an overview of the various existing systems of supervision of the various professions, the Dutch government’s views on this and the current developments regarding the supervision of civil-law notaries and practising lawyers. Chapter 9 analyses the external Wwft supervision by the Bureau Financial Supervision (hereafter: BFT). Chapter 10 describes the internal Wwft supervision by the KNB and the president of the notarial disciplinary court. Chapter 11 describes the internal Wwft supervision of practising lawyers, analysing it according to the principles of legal certainty, <b>legal</b> privilege, <b>effectiveness</b> and equivalence, and discusses proposals to enhance supervision. Chapter 12 discusses the internal Wwft supervision by the professional organisations of accountants and tax advisors. Chapter 13 shows that currently the disciplinary sanctions of the Wwft are not legally certain, not effective and not equivalent to the administrative sanctions through the Wwft regime and the Financial Supervision Act. Part IV The final chapter, Chapter 14, presents the conclusions and recommendations for each profession separately. [...] [1]Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorism...|$|R

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that <b>legal</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{may depend on}} how an individual perceives him/herself as a competent user of law.

The effectiveness concept was tested on survey data collected from 246 managers in northwest Russia. The result is that the subjective self-perceptions are a stronger determinant of the use of law than is the perceived institutional efficiency. Persons were to a lesser degree adopting law as an instrument conditioned on their calculation of the efficiency of courts and other institutions, but to a greater degree adopting law as a form of communication conditioned on their feeling of assuredness about their ability to communicate with legal terminology. Therefore there is a latent potential for improvement of <b>legal</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in the enhancement of how individuals perceive themselves as knowledgeable users of law...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{challenges}} {{the notion of}} effectiveness of law as being based on the formal institutions of courts, law enforcement and written law. It argues {{that the best way}} to measure the effectiveness of law is the legal self-efficacy of laymen who are the end users of law.   It presents a new perspective on the effectiveness of law. It turns the traditional perspective of studying the effects of legal institutions around and instead studies the effect of how individuals perceive their own ability to use law. This self-reflexive ability - legal self-efficacy -  is the answer to the question “How comfortable are with communicating with legal terminology?”. The thesis makes several comparisons using the traditional perspective and legal self-efficacy and finds that legal self-efficacy is a better measure of <b>legal</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> This thesis analyzes 246 businesspeople in Russia and their risk behavior  with regards to economic transactions in relation to legal self-efficacy.  The theory behind legal self-efficacy is a combination of Luhmann’s theory of law as communication and Bandura’s concept of self-efficacy.   The first paper applies the traditional approach. It analyzes the effect of legal efficiency on leverage and debt maturity for listed and non-listed companies. The second paper is describes the conceptual foundation of the <b>legal</b> <b>effectiveness</b> based on the individual. The third paper compares the effect of private order (including legal self-efficacy) and public order institutions on the granting of trade credit.   The fourth paper analyzes the impact of legal self-efficacy and formal legal institutions on sanctions against clients in a comparative perspective. The final paper seeks out possible sources of legal self-efficacy. Legal self-efficacy can be used to better understand the interaction of individuals and law including such fields of research as behavioral accounting, behavioral law and finance, legal sociology and legal studies. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} {{and analysis of the}} EU law and policy on Schengen visas. The EU visa policy is analysed in its historical development and its place in the framework of Schengen acquis. Separately, important visa policy measures are analysed including the typology of visas, exceptions from visa obligation, visa reciprocity, visa facilitation and processes of visa liberalisation. Different phases of the visa procedure are studied with focus on the questions whether there is a right to be issued a Schengen visa when the conditions are met and the right of appeal. The relevant legislation subject to analysis is above all the Visa Code, the regulation on visa lists and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. By way of illustration, the implementation in the Czech legal order is used and jurisprudence of the Czech higher courts is quoted to show to what extent the EU visa procedure and visa refusal matches the requirements of the administrative law theory on the administrative procedure and decision in general. The relevant rules are assessed as to the extent they match with principles of legitimacy, influence of <b>legal</b> certainty, <b>effectiveness</b> and proportionality.

They compare an informal enforcement mechanism, reputation, the efficacy of which is enhanced by consumers investing in"connectedness,"with a formal mechanism, <b>legal</b> enforcement, the <b>effectiveness</b> {{of which can be}} reduced by producers by means of bribes. When legal enforcement is poor, consumers connect more with one another to improve informal enforcement. In contrast, a well-connected network of consumers reduces producers'incentives to bribe. In equilibrium, the model predicts a positive relationship between the frequency of productivity shocks, bribing, and the use of informal enforcement, providing a physical explanation of why developing countries often fail to have efficient legal systems.
