5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
25|$|At <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> {{temperatures}} {{the common}} ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat {{to be lost}} to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures.|$|E

40|$|We look {{in detail}} at {{the process of}} mapping an astrophysical initial model from a stellar {{evolution}} code onto the computational grid of an explicit, Godunov type code while maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. This mapping process is common in astrophysical simulations, when {{it is necessary to}} follow short-timescale dynamics after a period of long timescale buildup. We look at the effects of spatial resolution, boundary conditions, the treatment of the gravitational source terms in the hydrodynamics solver, and the initialization process itself. We conclude with a summary detailing the mapping process that yields the <b>lowest</b> <b>ambient</b> velocities in the mapped model. Comment: 59 pages, 21 figures, accepted to ApJS.

This leads to increased illumination in <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> light environments, such as moonless nights. Light amplification is around 20,000×. Also improved were image resolution and reliability.|$|E
25|$|An OLED display works {{without a}} backlight; thus, it can display deep black levels {{and can be}} thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> light {{conditions}} (such as a dark room), an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, {{regardless of whether the}} LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{mechanism to}} preserve O2 delivery {{in the face}} of <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> oxygen is to increase the affinity of the blood. The oxygen content of the blood is related to PaO2 and is illustrated using an oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC).

40|$|A {{prospective}} study {{was made of}} 1500 elderly patients who suffered from acute hip fractures from 1986 to 1990. There were 36 per cent more fractures in the 6 colder months from November to April than {{in the rest of}} the year (P < 0. 001). A strong correlation between the monthly adjusted fracture rate and the average <b>lowest</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature was also observed (P < 0. 001). The fractures occurred in the older and less active patients during the 6 colder months. More importantly they needed to wait longer for the operation during this 'high' season. This might be responsible for the higher medical complication rate after the operation. Better health care planning to help with the increased patient load in the 'high' season is essential to reduce the waiting time for the operation and the postoperative medical complication rate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|A. d. laboriosa, the Himalayan giant honey bee, was {{initially}} {{described as a}} distinct species. Later, it was included in A. dorsata as a subspecies based on the biological species concept, though authors applying a genetic species concept have suggested it {{should be considered a}} separate species. Essentially restricted to the Himalayas, it differs little from the giant honey bee in appearance, but has extensive behavioral adaptations that enable it to nest in the open at high altitudes despite <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures.

25|$|According to Chris Horwill (AREVA T) {{there are}} four main design ratings in the de-icer mode. The first one is the Standard de-icer mode. It works at 250MW and 7200A from ±17.4kV at 10°C. The second one is the Verification mode. It works at 200MW and 5760A from ±17.4kV at 30°C.The third one is the 1-hour overload. This one works at 300MW and 7200A from ±20.8kV at 10°C. The last one is the <b>Low</b> <b>ambient</b> overload. It works at 275MW and 7920A from ±17.4kV at -5°C. KV is the voltage and A is the currents. The range of {{operation}} of the current and voltage is large {{because all of the}} sections have different characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} natural phenomena, geysers {{are not unique}} to planet Earth. [...] Jet-like eruptions, often {{referred}} to as cryogeysers, have been observed on several of the moons of the outer solar system. Due to the <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> pressures, these eruptions consist of vapor without liquid; they are made more easily visible by particles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas. Water vapor jets have been observed near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus, while nitrogen eruptions have been observed on Neptune's moon Triton. There are also signs of carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars. In the latter two cases, instead of being driven by geothermal energy, the eruptions seem to rely on solar heating via a solid-state greenhouse effect.|$|E

30|$|The {{concentration}} of mercury on the S- 4 site is 1.57 [*]±[*] 0.37 ng/m 3, {{which is the}} <b>lowest</b> (<b>ambient</b> site), while on the S- 4 site (traffic/densely populated) the gighest concentration 14.5 [*]±[*] 2.9 ng/m 3 was observed. The relative uncertainty in the measurement of mercury by FAAS-HG varies from 19 to 23 %. Gajghate et al. 2011 have also estimated analytical uncertainty in quantification of mercury in different fractions of PM 10 using microwave digestion and DMA- 80 mercury analyzer. The mercury concentrations in ambient air in different various fractions of PM 10 {{were found to be}} in the range of 3.13 ng m- 3 (26 %) – 22.96 ng m- 3 (15 %) with respective expanded relative uncertainty. Synek et al. 2000 estimated uncertainties in mercury determinations in biological materials by atomic absorption spectrometer – AMA 254 and suggested major uncertainty (52 %) is due to sample absorbance measurement.|$|R
30|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorous}} availability {{may limit}} primary productivity, with co-limitation occurring commonly (Corkum 1996; Tank and Dodds 2003; Harpole et al. 2011). Periphyton chlorophyll-a biomass levels on the NDS growth filters {{were significantly higher}} with the upstream N + P treatment, but only compared to the downstream control and N-addition treatment. The lack of within-reach significance between the control and any nutrient-addition treatment implies a lack of nutrient limitation for both reaches. The negative N/C and P/C ratio values in the upstream reach, plus the very small N + P/C value, also indicates that periphyton responses were stimulated to a minor degree only by the dual nutrient treatment. Although the upstream reach had the <b>lowest</b> <b>ambient</b> N and P levels and was also the only not classified as a eutrophic system according to the criteria established by Dodds et al. (1998), ample nutrient content may still have been present for the short-term establishment of periphyton communities.|$|R

2500|$|Hyperventilation depletes {{the blood}} of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia), which causes {{respiratory}} alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. This results in a lower venous partial pressure of oxygen, which worsens hypoxia. A normally ventilated breath-hold usually breaks (from CO2) with over 90% saturation which is far from hypoxia. [...] Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but {{not as strong as}} the hypercapnic respiratory drive. This has been studied in altitude medicine, where hypoxia occurs without hypercapnia due to the <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure. The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training. These variations imply that predictive risk cannot be reliably estimated, but pre-dive hyperventilation carries definite risks.|$|E
2500|$|Photoluminescent fire {{extinguisher}} signs {{are made with}} nontoxic photoluminescent phosphor that absorbs ambient light and releases it slowly in dark conditions—the sign [...] "glows in the dark". Such signs are independent of an external power supply, and so offer a low-cost, reliable means of indicating the position of emergency equipment in dark or smoky conditions. The luminance performance for life safety appliance location signs should {{meet the requirements of}} International Standard ISO 17398 so that the sign is not only excited at very <b>low</b> <b>ambient</b> light levels (25 lux), but also has effective luminance intensity and longevity, making the life-safety message conspicuous in the event of power failure, or if smoke obscures emergency ceiling lights.

40|$|Abstract- 1. Complete {{deoxygenation}} of {{arterial blood}} {{results in the}} failure of oxygen consumption in brown bullheads (Ictalurus nebulosus) at <b>low</b> levels of <b>ambient</b> oxygen. 2. The arterial deoxygenation apparently results from inability of the blood to load oxygen across the diffusion barrier of the gills, since gill ventilation and perfusion continue after oxygen uptake ceases. 3. The ambient oxygen tension at which this occurs differs appropriately in two groups of bullheads known to have different blood oxygen affinities {{as a result of}} thermal acclimation. The oxygen affinity of the blood is therefore strongly implicated as a factor limiting oxygen uptake at <b>low</b> levels of <b>ambient</b> oxygen...|$|R
