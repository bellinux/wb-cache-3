500|$|After {{his father}} left, Shirley took many odd jobs {{to support the}} family, up to four at the same time. In his 1997 {{biography}} Bad As I Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: [...] "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father". (He would not meet his father again until 2012.) ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble, Perry {{wrote the}} song {{entitled}} [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] for her third studio album, Teenage Dream. A total of 17 music engineers {{contributed to the}} track's composition. Critics suggest the song is about her former relationship with Gym Class Heroes' lead vocalist Travie McCoy. When finally asked about his opinion on the track, McCoy admitted to hearing about [...] "Circle the Drain", but has never actually listened to the song. Nonetheless, he commented: [...] "I heard she put out a song that's about me, or about some old habits or whatever. [...] I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this: I'm just stoked that she finally has a song with some substance on her record. Good job." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicole is Roman Harris' (Conrad Coleby) {{daughter}} {{and she was}} often mentioned on-screen before producers decided to introduce her into the serial. In January2008 {{it was announced that}} ex-Neighbours star Tessa James had been cast as Nicole. Executive producer Cameron Welsh said [...] "She is an exciting talent and I think audiences are going to love her character and respond really well to her." [...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an apprenticeship and never forget how lucky I am." [...] Fellow cast member Celeste Dodwell who plays Melody Jones originally auditioned for the part of Nicole. After Coleby who plays Roman quit the serial, James' time with the show was in doubt.|$|E

6000|$|... "I say!" [...] he observed, with dismay. [...] "I never <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that before! I can see that, {{from your}} point of view, this must look like a bit of a wash-out!" ...|$|R

500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E

Die Natur sucht sich ja auch aus, was sie gebrauchen kann, was sie sich vermehren läßt und was nicht. Und wenn wir's mal so nehmen: Wenn die Lesben und Schwulen nun auch noch Kinder kriegen würden, dann hätten wir heute noch viel mehr Arbeitslose" [...] ("That {{lesbians and}} gays can't have {{children}} is after all quite natural. Nature too seeks {{out what it}} can use, what can reproduce and what can't. If we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that, if lesbians and gays did have children, then we'd {{have a lot more}} unemployed people today") – a remark made during a lecture on 12 March 1997 in Berlin – meant that she lost friends within the gay scene as well.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} reporters after the 2011 ALDS {{if he had}} {{considered}} {{that he might have}} played for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, [...] "I don't want to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that. We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, {{when you look at what}} he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you talk about being proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] Festing {{answered}} with some embarrassment. [...] "Still I think you're exaggerating; nobody would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that. Our neighbors know {{one has to}} stay with one's work." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{took the}} Virgil {{out of the}} big pocket of his coat, but the cover was very black and swollen with the wet, and the page when he opened it was very yellow, but that was no great matter, for he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> a man that had never learned to read.

5000|$|Snoopzilla {{explained}} that he and Dâm made the album only thirty-four minutes in length because it would induce the listener to want more. [...] "We just be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> only 34 minutes of music. That's all we gave up was 34 minutes. But it's 34 minutes of quality music, good music. Babygirl that an interview with me, she was like, 'That music {{reminds me of a}} big hug. I could just play it from top to bottom.' There's a lot of albums you can't play from top to bottom anymore, you gotta go to your favorite song and go back and go forward. This record you could play from top to bottom.

50|$|Like elision (as in *je aime → j'aime), {{it can be}} {{characterized}} functionally as a euphonic strategy for avoiding hiatus. If we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this, we are adopting a synchronic approach. This approach does not explain cases where the first word already ends in a consonant, such as telsamis, and is therefore already perfectly euphonic.|$|E

[...] And Tony's like, [...] "Man, he's rippin', he's nineteen years-old, he can, you know, it's really up to him. You guys talk to him, you know?" [...] So we just kinda said, [...] "You wanna get some boards?", he's like, [...] "I'm down, man!" [...] And I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>like,</b> {{there would be no}} Baker without Tony and Birdhouse. I know it's an ongoing process, you know? Tony quits to start Birdhouse; I quit to start Baker; my guys quit to start a new brand, you know? It's just an ongoing thing.|$|E
60|$|Occasionally in the {{dialogue}} I see an expression here and there which might--always solely with a reference to your misgiving--be better away; and I think that the vision, {{to use the word}} for want of a better--in the museum, should be made a little less abstruse. I should not say that, if the sale of the journal was below the sale of The Times newspaper; but as it is probably several thousands higher, I do. I would also suggest that after the title we put the two words--A ROMANCE. It is an absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving with the blockheads, but I think it would be an effective one. I don't, on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>like</b> the title. Here are a few that have occurred to me.|$|R

[...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with SteelSeries, Hendrixson imparted his post-retirement plans to study mobile electronics installation at university and throughout his appearances the following two years hinted at a possible halt in competitive play. Finally, in 2013, Hendrixson revealed a new statement regarding the subject of retirement: [...] I think I'll just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> 'Hey, if I {{have the time to}} go play in a big tournament and can prepare for it, I will, so I won't say that I'll 'retire'. I'm going to always leave the door open. I've accomplished quite a bit in Quake, and to me I don't really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> 'Okay, I've finally won this. Now I'm good.' I've always tried to take it one tournament at a time, and I'm always looking to win, and do more, and I think it'll always be that way. If you don't {{look at it that way}} it's so difficult to win against someone who really wants it more than you." ...|$|E

5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound.

We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But {{what do we need}} to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|R
