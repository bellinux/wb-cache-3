40|$|The CAM {{chip design}} was {{produced}} in a UNIX software environment using a design tool that supports definition of digital electronic modules, composition of these modules into higher <b>level</b> <b>circuits,</b> and event-driven simulation of these circuits. Our design tool provides an interface whose goals include straightforward but flexible primitive module definition and circuit composition, efficient simulation, and a debugging environment that facilitates design verification and alteration. The tool provides a set of primitive modules which can be composed into higher <b>level</b> <b>circuits.</b> Each module is a C-language subroutine that uses a set of interface protocols understood by the design tool. Primitives can be altered simply by recoding their C-code image; in addition new primitives can be added allowing higher <b>level</b> <b>circuits</b> to be described in C-code {{rather than as a}} composition of primitive modules [...] this feature can greatly enhance the speed of simulation...|$|R

We propose two <b>level</b> shifting <b>circuits</b> that reduce problems that exist in complementary <b>level</b> shifting <b>circuits</b> described previously. Using HSPICE parameters of a 0. 35 um CMOS process, simulations have been performed under various capacitive loading and operating conditions. The simulation results show that our design method can achieve 16. 6 % low-to-high propagation delay decrease and 27. 2 % low-to-high power delay product improvement when converting 3. 3 V to 5 V compared with conventional <b>level</b> shifting <b>circuits.</b> In addition, as the working voltages being converted are reduced, the design yields still greater advantage without degrading circuit performance...|$|R

Bach synthesizes RT <b>level</b> <b>circuits</b> from a system description written in Bach-C language, where a system is modeled as communicating processes running in parallel. The system description is decomposed into threads, i. e., strings of sequential processes, and then converted into synthesizable behavioral VHDL models. The proposed method attempts to find a partitioning of a given system description into threads that maximize resource sharing among processes in the threads. Experiments on two real designs show that the circuit sizes were reduced by 3. 7 % and 14. 7 %.

40|$|Prior work on {{modeling}} interconnects {{has focused}} on opti-mizing the wire and repeater design for trading o energy and delay, and is largely based on low <b>level</b> <b>circuit</b> parame-ters. Hence these models are hard to use directly to make high level microarchitectural trade-os in the initial explo-ration phase of a design. In this paper, we propose IN-TACTE, a tool {{that can be used}} by architects to get reason-ably accurate interconnect area, delay, and power estimates based on a few architecture level parameters for the inter-connect such as length, width (in number of bits), frequency, and latency for a specied technology and voltage. The tool uses well known models of interconnect delay and energy taking into account the wire pitch, repeater size, and spacing for a range of voltages and technologies. It then solves an optimization problem of nding the lowest energy interconnect design in terms of the low <b>level</b> <b>circuit</b> parameters, which meets the architectural constraints given as inputs. In addition, the tool also provides the area, en-ergy, and delay for a range of supply voltages and degrees of pipelining, which can be used for micro-architectural ex-ploration of a chip. The delay and energy models used by the tool have been validated against low <b>level</b> <b>circuit</b> simu-lations. We discuss several potential applications of the tool and present an example of optimizing interconnect design in the context of clustered VLIW architectures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the size of}} monotone circuits for quadratic boolean functions, that is, disjunctions of length- 2 monomials. Our motivation {{is that a good}} (linear in the number of variables) lower bound on the monotone circuit size for a certain type of quadratic function would imply a good (even exponential) lower bound on the general non-monotone circuit size. To get more insight into the structure of monotone circuits for quadratic functions, we {{consider the}} so-called single level conjecture posed explicitely around 1990. The conjecture claims that mo-notone single <b>level</b> <b>circuits,</b> that is, circuits which have only one level of AND gates, for quadratic functions are not much larger than arbitrary monotone circuits. In this paper we disprove the conjec-ture: there are quadratic functions whose monotone circuits have linear size whereas their monotone single <b>level</b> <b>circuits</b> require almost quadratic size...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the total power consumption in high performance digital circuits in deep submicron regime is mainly due to leakage power. Leakage is the only source of power consumption in an idle circuit. Therefore it is important to reduce leakage power in portable systems. In this paper twotechniques such as transistor stacking and self-adjustable voltage <b>level</b> <b>circuit</b> for reducing leakage power in sequential circuits are proposed. This work analyses the power and delay of three different types of D flip-flops using pass transistors, transmission gates and gate diffusion input gates.. All the circuits are simulated with and without the application of leakage reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed pass transistor based D flip-flop using self-adjustable voltage <b>level</b> <b>circuit</b> has the least leakage power dissipation of 9. 13 nW with a delay of 77 nS. The circuits are simulated with MOSFET models of level 54 using HSPICE in 90 nm process technology...|$|R
