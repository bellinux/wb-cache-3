5000|$|A 1978 {{study showed}} that Dutch Landrace pigs are {{especially}} responsive [...] - [...] compared, for example, to the Dutch Yorkshire crossbreed [...] - [...] to the halothane-induced malignant hyperthermia test (halothane test, for short), {{which can be used}} to weed out specimens with high susceptibility to stress and likely abnormal meat quality. [...] Dutch Landraces are responsive 22% of the time (vs. 3% for Dutch Yorkshires), and those responsive to the test are almost ten times likelier to die during the fattening period than responsive Dutch Yorkshires. [...] Two 1980 follow-up studies by the same team of researchers found that the Dutch Landrace's susceptibility is inherited as [...] "a single recessive autosomal trait", and [...] "the gene for this trait affects production traits", including carcass and meat quality. [...] Three genotypes (genetic strains) have been identified in the breed: Heterozygous for (carrying but not expressing) the gene, and homozygous either for (expressing) the gene, or not possessing it at all. The heterozygous has an intermediate carcass and meat quality and a selection advantage. The homozygous for reactivity to halothane had lowest meat quality, though highest meat production of the three genotypes, and as noted in the first study, its high reactivity level can be used for screening. [...] It also has the lowest percentage <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Halothene-reactive castrated males, as opposed to un-modified boars, differed from non-reactive in [...] "all carcass and meat quality traits", and had [...] "significantly lower feed conversion ratios". Halothene reactivity seems to be more heritable from the sire than the dam; in a population with an average 24.9% of individuals being reactive, 40.7% of those with reacting sires were themselves reactive, vs. 21.3% without.|$|E
40|$|The carcass {{and eating}} quality of sheep grazing a saltbush {{dominant}} saline pasture system or on a ‘control’ dry pasture, stubble plot both supplemented with barley for 14 weeks was investigated (Experiment 1, 50 (2 × 25) 6 month merino lamb wethers and Experiment 2, 50 (2 × 25) 18 month old merino hogget wethers). Treatment had no {{significant effect on}} eating quality attributes (P > 0. 05). Saltbush grazed sheep in both experiments had a significantly (P < 0. 01) lower carcass fat and significantly higher lean (P < 0. 01) content than the control grazed sheep. This is a positive finding as fat denudation is a significant cost to processors. The long term consumption of saltbush and barley prior to slaughter did increase muscle fluid content (P < 0. 05) but {{did not result in}} a decreased carcass weight <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> due to confounding changes in body composition. Grazing saltbush resulted in increased urine weight (P < 0. 001) and decreased urine concentration (P < 0. 05) at slaughter indicating an improved hydration status at slaughter. However both experiments demonstrated sub-optimal liveweight gains indicating that saltbush with a barley supplement can still be effectively used as a maintenance ration without compromising carcass and eating quality...|$|E
40|$|In a {{field trial}} at a {{commercial}} piggery 22 pigs were vaccinated intraperitoneally, at 30 days and 60 days old, with formalin-killed M. pneumoniae plus adjuvant. Two {{other groups of}} the same size, one receiving a ration containing antibiotics, were not vaccinated. The mean ELISA ratio of the vaccinated group increased significantly after 30 days, and continued to rise until day 156 of life. In the other 2 groups the ELISA ratio did not increase significantly until day 115. The vaccinated pigs in the 30 -day period after the first vaccination grew significantly more slowly than the controls but between days 60 and 144 they grew significantly faster than the 2 other groups, thus compensating for their previous, relative <b>loss.</b> <b>At</b> <b>slaughter</b> (at 163 days old), the mean weight was similar in all groups. The mean score for pneumonia at slaughter for the vaccinated, medicated and control groups was 2. 6 (± 4. 3), 9. 4 (± 14. 0) and 10. 5 (± 12. 4), respectively. The proportion of M. hyopneumoniae-affected lungs (4. 8 %) in vaccinated pigs, as judged by immunofluorescence, was significantly less than the control groups (40 %).

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of genetic {{constitution}} (stock) and rearing temperature on the occurrence of hemorrhages in thighs and breasts of water bath stunned broilers was investigated. Particular attention {{was given to the}} relation between the susceptibility for hemorrhages, body composition, and adaptations in blood variables induced by low rearing temperatures. A factorial experiment was performed with five parental stocks, differing with respect to growth rate, feed conversion, and body composition, and two temperature regimens (thermoneutral and below the zone of thermoneutrality). Hemorrhage scores in thighs were dependent on rearing temperature, not on stock, and were highest in broilers reared at low temperatures. In all stocks, high scores in the thighs were accompanied by an increased carbon dioxide pressure and bicarbonate and triiodothyronine concentration of the venous blood, and by an increased relative heart weight, hematocrit, and blood <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Hemorrhage scores in breasts were dependent on stock, confounded with day of scoring. An effect of rearing temperature was present only for the leanest, slow-growing stock having the lowest feed conversion ratio at thermoneutral rearing conditions. Scores in breasts were related neither to body composition nor to metabolic and hemodynamic adaptations to low rearing temperatures. It is concluded that high hemorrhage scores in thighs are related to hemodynamic and metabolic adaptations to an increased need for energy and oxygen caused by low rearing temperatures. Hemorrhage scores are not related to stock-dependent differences...|$|E
40|$|European {{legislation}} {{demands that}} slaughter animals, including poultry, be rendered immediately unconscious and insensible until death occurs through blood <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> This study addressed requirements for stunner settings (i. e., voltage, wave oscillation frequency) and response parameters (i. e., applied current, behavior) affecting effective water bath stunning. An inventory of current electrical stunning practice {{was performed in}} 10 slaughterhouses in the Netherlands. Thereafter, measurements were performed using a single-bird water bath {{to examine the effects}} of stunner settings based on the average technical settings observed in the slaughterhouses. Responses were recorded at 50, 400, and 1, 000 Hz on broilers and hens and at 50 and 400 Hz on ducks under controlled laboratory conditions. Effects of voltage settings (broilers: 100 to 400 V; hens: 150 to 300 V; ducks: 150 to 400 V) on current levels (broilers: 45 to 444 mA; hens: 40 to 219 mA; ducks: 64 to 362 mA) and consciousness (response to pain stimulus) were recorded immediately after stunning. Brain and heart activity was monitored using electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram technology. Results show that effective stunning using the conventional water bath almost exclusively produces blood splashing in broilers. Effective stunning current levels did not differ significantly between broilers, hens, and ducks effectively stunned hens tended to require lower currents. Effective stuns at higher frequencies resulted in higher currents. Similar input voltage (V) levels (within and between bird type) resulted in significant variation (P < 0. 001) in current levels (mA) required for an effective stun, indicating variability in electrical impedance between individual birds. Body weight and bird type did not affect the probability of an effective stun. Multi-bird water bath usage does not ensure effective stunning and technical adjustments can result in detrimental effects on meat quality. Future legislation should consider wave form, relationships between frequency and current allowing for individual impedance variation and effects on meat quality while safeguarding animal welfare...|$|E

The farm-level data were collected during farm visits {{at the beginning of}} the study. Routine meat inspection findings for the lambs were obtained from the 10 participating abattoirs. The most common abnormalities found during post-mortem inspection were pneumonia/pleurisy (53 % of cohorts), lungworm (40 %), abscesses (30 %), liver fluke (27 %) and nephritis/nephrosis (27 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine renal lipofuscinosis (BRL) is an {{incidental}} {{finding in}} cattle <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Condemnation of the kidneys as unfit {{for human consumption}} was until recently considered the only implication of BRL. Recent studies have indicated a negative influence on the health of affected animals. The present study investigated the prevalence, genetics and effect of BRL on milk yield and weight <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Methods BRL status of slaughter cattle was recorded at four abattoirs during a 2 -year-period. Data regarding breed, age, genetic descent, milk yield and weight <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> were extracted from the Danish Cattle Database. The prevalence of BRL was estimated stratified by breed and age-group. Furthermore, total milk yield, milk yield in last full lactation and weight <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> were compared for BRL-affected and non-affected Danish Holsteins and Danish Red cattle. Results 433, 759 bovines were slaughtered and 787 of these had BRL. BRL was mainly diagnosed in Danish Red, Danish Holstein and crossbreds. The age of BRL affected animals varied from 11 months to 13 years, but BRL was rarely diagnosed in cattle less than 2 years of age. The total lifelong energy corrected milk (ECM) yields were 3, 136 and 4, 083 kg higher for BRL affected Danish Red and Danish Holsteins, respectively. However, the median life span of affected animals was 4. 9 months longer, and age-corrected total milk yield was 1, 284 kg lower for BRL affected Danish Red cows. These cows produced 318 kg ECM less in their last full lactation. Weight <b>at</b> <b>slaughter</b> was not affected by BRL status. The cases occurred in patterns consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and several family clusters of BRL were found. Analysis of segregation ratios demonstrated the expected ratio for Danish Red cattle, but not for Danish Holsteins. Conclusion The study confirmed that BRL is a common finding in Danish Holsteins and Danish Red cattle <b>at</b> <b>slaughter.</b> The disorder is associated with increased total milk yield due to a longer production life. However, a reduced milk yield was detected in the end of the production life in Danish Red. The study supports that BRL is inherited autosomal recessively in the Danish Red breed and Danish Holsteins, but with incomplete penetrance of the genotype in Danish Holsteins. </p...|$|R
