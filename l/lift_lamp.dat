5000|$|She {{was born}} in Lancaster County in Manheim, Pennsylvania and {{attended}} school there. She later attended Drexel University and lived {{and worked as a}} schoolteacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her most well known work is Amanda: A Daughter of the Mennonites (1921); other works include Patchwork; a Story of [...] "the Plain People" [...] (1920), The Madonna of the Curb (1922), I <b>Lift</b> My <b>Lamp,</b> and a collection of poetry entitled Rain on the Roof (1931). Amanda, about a young Mennonite girl who seeks an education, is hired as a teacher in a local one-room schoolhouse, and eventually marries a childhood friend, contains many delightful appreciations of life along with early 20th century reminiscences, as indicated by such chapters as: [...] "The Snitzing Party", [...] "Boiling Apple Butter", [...] "The Spelling Bee", and [...] "One Heart Made o' Two" [...] Patchwork, {{the story of a young}} girl growing up within a community of [...] "plain people", some of the story in the format of a diary, includes the girl's first romance. Myers' work is frequently viewed as a gentle corrective to the harsh misrepresentations of another novelist, Helen Reimensnyder Martin, also from Lancaster County, whose stories about the Pennsylvania Dutch of Lancaster County, particularly her Tillie: a Mennonite Maid, provoked cries of misrepresentation from those who resented her depictions. Myers also authored another work, quite different from her other fiction, I <b>Lift</b> My <b>Lamp,</b> a historical novel about the early settlement of Lancaster County, Henry William Stiegel and his glassworks in Manheim, a Mennonite Eby family, and the Ephrata Cloister.|$|R

60|$|A bent iron plate {{hung from}} a tottering beam when he crawled up to the after end of the hold, and he savagely tried to wrench {{it out with a}} bar. The effort taxed his strength, but when he felt that he could keep it up no longer the timber yielded, and he fell forward into the gap. It cost him some trouble to recover his balance, and while he {{crouched}} on hands and knees, the disturbed water pulsed heavily into the dark hole. <b>Lifting</b> his <b>lamp,</b> he saw that the floor was deep in sand; and out of the sand two wooden boxes projected. He found that he could not drag them clear, and it seemed impossible to remove them without some tackle, but in groping about he came upon a bag. It was made of common canvas, and had been heavily sealed, though part of the wax had broken away, but on lifting it Jimmy found the material strong enough to hold its contents.|$|R

Passing his hand over the canvas dress, which felt ominously slack, he fumbled at the lamp. As he did so a {{wavering}} beam of light shot out, shining uncertainly through the water; and he supposed that in falling he must have broken the circuit by pressing the switch. <b>Lifting</b> the <b>lamp,</b> he saw that the tube was bent sharply round a ragged timber, and while his heart throbbed painfully and his breath grew labored, he moved back and reached for it; but he found his hands nerveless and his legs unsteady, and when he stooped to loose the line his head reeled and he pitched forward across the timber, grasping the line as he fell.|$|R
60|$|Adam {{was silent}} for a few minutes, and while Kit mused, shovels clinked in the stokehold and the vessel began to <b>lift.</b> The tilted <b>lamp</b> {{straightened}} and its light rested on Adam's wasted form. His silk pyjamas rather emphasized than hid his gauntness; he looked strangely worn and weak, but Kit could picture the strong passion of his love-making. There was something fierce and primitive about the old Buccaneer, and it was not hard to see how he had, so to speak, swept the romantic girl off her feet by the fiery spirit that had burned him out. Yet he had never talked about other women, and though he knew the South, Kit thought he had cared for none.|$|R
60|$|Julian and Alice {{exchanged}} glances {{as her father}} turned from them, and <b>lifting</b> a <b>lamp</b> which stood in the entrance-hall, {{led the way to}} the interior apartment. There was little of consolation in this exchange of looks; for the sadness of Alice's glance was mingled with fear, and that of Julian clouded by an anxious sense of doubt. The look also was but momentary; for Alice, springing to her father, took the light out of his hand, and stepping before him, acted as the usher of both into the large oaken parlour, which has been already mentioned as the apartment in which Bridgenorth had spent the hours of dejection which followed the death of his consort and family. It was now lighted up as for the reception of company; and five or six persons sat in it, in the plain, black, stiff dress, which was affected by the formal Puritans of the time, in evidence of their contempt of the manners of the luxurious Court of Charles the Second; amongst whom, excess of extravagance in apparel, like excess of every other kind, was highly fashionable.|$|R

Immigration {{has been the}} primary source of growth for the Unites States of America. It was {{discovered}} by foreigners and the subsequent immigrants that inhibited this newly discovered land were the people who shaped the country that we live in. But many of today’s immigrants are not welcomed as in the past. One problem that can be solved is that of making the promise of Lazarus’ words engraved on The Statue of Liberty real for the undocumented children of immigrants who are being denied equal access to education. The Dream Act is the solution, but it can’t seem to make through Congress. The poster deals with the inability of Congress to pass the Dream Act year after year due to anti-immigration attitudes and overall immigration politics and policy. It utilizes a SWOT analysis that relies heavily upon Washington State’s newly passed H. O. P. E Act to lay out the strengths, weaknesses, and long term opportunities as well as the near future threats of variations on the legislation...|$|R

Three lamp reflector constructions were made of cylinder shape for one construction and cone shape with opening angle α =  62 ° and 90 ° for two others. The dimension (øR × HR) for each reflector are 30  ×  37 (cm), 40  ×  18 (cm) and 40  ×  39. 62 (cm). Each lamp reflector was being operated by 1 lift net for 15 nights. Total fishing operations were twice per night within interval 07. 00 – 12. 00  PM and 00. 00 – 05. 00 AM. Results of the catch gave 2 schools of fish which were plankton feeders and predators. Plankton feeders included anchovy Stolephorus spp. 477  kg, mackerel (Rastrelliger spp.) 1934  kg, and malayan half (Decapterus sp.) 15. 5  kg. Predators consisted of hairtail (Trichiurus sp.) 982  kg, yellowstrip scad (Selaroides spp.) 29  kg, and giant trevally (Caranx sp.) 26. 3  kg. The lift net which operated lamp reflector of α =  90 ° has the highest catch of 2, 307. 8  kg, while the lamp reflector of α =  62 ° has 1895  kg of catch.

To Worlds Unknown seeks to capture the mixture of emotions of this epic sea voyage and as such is unashamedly programmatic in character.

As she <b>lifted</b> the <b>lamp</b> and looked up, she saw a strange woman descending toward her, holding the balustrade, and moving as though with pains in her limbs. This woman, whose black hair fell nearly to her waist, {{was dressed in a}} crimson satin dressing-gown, warmly padded, and much stained and splashed. She had fine dark eyes, and was young, bold-looking, and handsome; but when she came nearer, the moist pallor of her skin, the slackness of her lower lip and jaw, and an eager and worn expression in her fine eyes, gave her a thirsty, reckless leer that filled Marian with loathing. Her aspect conveyed the same painful suggestion as her voice had done before, but more definitely; for it struck Marian, with a shock, that Conolly, in the grotesque metamorphosis of a nightmare, might appear in some such likeness. The lamp did not seem to attract her attention at first; but when she came within a few steps, she saw some one before her, and, dazzled by the light, peered at Marian, who lost her presence of mind, and stood motionless. Gradually the woman's expression changed to one of astonishment. She came down to the landing; stopped, grasping the handrail to steady herself; and said in her husky voice: ...|$|R

60|$|When the two ladies withdrew, he {{attended}} {{them to their}} carriage. Coming back to the drawing-room, he paused outside the open door; {{he was struck by}} the group formed by the three men. They were standing before Roderick's statue of Eve, and the young sculptor had <b>lifted</b> up the <b>lamp</b> and was showing different parts of it to his companions. He was talking ardently, and the lamplight covered his head and face. Rowland stood looking on, for the group struck him with its picturesque symbolism. Roderick, bearing the lamp and glowing in its radiant circle, seemed the beautiful image of a genius which combined sincerity with power. Gloriani, with his head on one side, pulling his long moustache and looking keenly from half-closed eyes at the lighted marble, represented art with a worldly motive, skill unleavened by faith, the mere base maximum of cleverness. Poor little Singleton, on the other side, with his hands behind him, his head thrown back, and his eyes following devoutly the course of Roderick's elucidation, might pass for an embodiment of aspiring candor, with feeble wings to rise on. In all this, Roderick's was certainly the beau role.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{seakeeping}} {{analysis of}} advanced marine vehicles presents many challenges. Such an {{analysis was performed}} for the lifting body technology demonstrator Sea Flyer, a 48. 8 m converted surface effect ship with a large lifting body amidships and an aft hydrofoil. Sea Flyer’s unconventional configuration, the large lift forces generated by the lifting body and aft foil, the transition from floating to flying conditions, {{and the importance of}} the dynamic ride control system preclude a traditional linear approach. To address these challenges, we used the Large Amplitude Motions Program (LAMP), a nonlinear, time-domain seakeeping simulation tool based on a 3 -D body-nonlinear potential flow solution of the wave-body interaction problem. For the Sea Flyer analysis, <b>LAMP’s</b> <b>lifting</b> force models were extended and adapted to model the lifting body and a simplified version of Sea Flyer’s ride control system was implemented. Seakeeping simulations were performed for a range of sea conditions including those experienced during sea trials and the results show good correlation to the measured sea trials data. This paper presents the characteristics of Sea Flyer, a description of the LAMP ship motion calculations, results of the numerical analysis, and a comparison of the predicted motions with sea trials data...|$|R
