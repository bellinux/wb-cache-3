50|$|As in {{the rest}} of Honduras, a {{majority}} of the population is Roman Catholic, with a growing percentage of Evangelicals. As such they observe the Christian holidays, or La Navidad, and the Holy Week preceding Easter, called Semana Santa as times of celebration. Christmas Eve, known as Nochebuena, as in much of Honduras, is celebrated with a late-night dinner with family and friends followed by <b>lighting</b> <b>off</b> fireworks at midnight. For Holy Week, there is a procession. Most businesses are closed Thursday and Friday of Holy Week as they are national holidays.|$|E
5000|$|According to the inverse-square law if the {{distance}} of a light source is changed in the following distance increments 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64 the intensity will decrease by one f/stop. In practical terms it means if one face in a group portrait is 4m from the [...] "key" [...] light and another is 5.6m away the face further from the light will be one f/stop darker. In an outdoor portrait {{of a group of}} 200 people taken on an overcast day the lighting all the faces will be equal. The same group photographed indoors would be far more difficult to light evenly. The simplest strategy requiring the least flash equipment would be to get above the group with the camera, have them look up and bounce the <b>lighting</b> <b>off</b> the ceiling so like an overcast day every face is as equidistant as possible to the apparent source of the light.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the later}} years of Napoleon's life, He {{spent some time}} with his grandson, Napoleon Andrew Tuiteleleapaga II in America. Soon after he {{returned}} to the island of American Samoa. He enjoyed his visit to America when he had learned that his grandson was to have a male child. This filled his spirit and gave him true happiness! His words to his grandson Napoleon were, [...] "The bloodline continues." [...] He returned to American Samoa in the later part of December. During a New Year's Eve celebration, local children were <b>lighting</b> <b>off</b> fireworks in the village of Leone. He walked outside of his home to urge the young children by scolding them to quiet down. Soon after a firework was let off and reached him at his feet. The firework went off right in front of him. Due to the suddenness and explosion of the firework, Napoleon had a Myocardial infarction and died.|$|E

5000|$|An hour later, Momm {{received}} {{a report that}} the bulkhead {{of one of the}} aft magazines was hot and an explosion was apparently imminent. Many of the ships officers had seen the disastrous consequences of a magazine explosion, and at 18:29 Momm gave the order to abandon ship. [...] stood by to take on survivors while her rescue and assistance team continued to spray water on Mullany. The [...] rescued 70 members of the Mullany crew from the water. The Execute then came alongside and helped fight the fires. In the next hours [...] came alongside the burning ship and extinguished the flames. Since the expected explosion had been prevented by punctured fuel and water tanks flooding the compartments above the hot magazine, Commander Momm took a skeleton crew back aboard at 23:00. After the fires were extinguished the Execute attempted a tow using her sweep gear. At first the Mullany was in tow at low speed. With an increase in speed the sweep cable snapped and the tow attempt was discontinued. The Mullany crew then succeeded in <b>lighting</b> <b>off</b> one boiler, and Mullany limped off on one shaft for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, arriving 29 May. Courage and determination had saved their ship, but 21 of her crew were killed, nine missing, and 36 wounded.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to discover the actual attitudes of the Respondents with regard to ‘Green’ issues and to develop an understanding of the level of knowledge they each have of the current issues, regularly advertised through various media outlets. In addition, to identify what measures if any the Respondents have already instigated for themselves. A multiple case study methodology was used, using the case study research strategy. A mixed method approach was employed using quantitative and qualitative data analysis processes. The sample size was 10 New Zealand small businesses, each representative of a different industry sector, based in Tauranga, New Zealand. The Respondents computer literacy ranged from the lower to upper spectrums, and the majority of the Respondents gained that knowledge and experience by being Self-taught. The range of ICT used in each Respondents business was investigated. The Respondents are not only concerned about, but have a reasonable understanding of ‘Green’ concepts. Most of the Respondents have instigated various aspects of recycling, including the use of recycled ink cartridges, recycling surplus ICT; and making every attempt to dispose of ICT using the most eco-friendly method available, as opposed to disposing of ICT devices in a local landfill. The majority of Respondents have implemented energy conservation by turning ICT devices and <b>lighting</b> <b>off</b> when not in use. Most of the Respondents place the responsibility of CO 2 emissions produced by manufacturing processes, firmly on the shoulders of big business, but did not realise that ICT produces 2 % of the earths CO 2 emissions...|$|E
40|$|Scented candles {{are known}} to release various {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) including both pleasant aromas and toxic components both before <b>lighting</b> (<b>off)</b> and when lit (on). In this study, we explored the compositional changes of volatiles from scented candles under various settings to simulate indoor use. Carbonyl compounds and other VOCs emitted from six different candle types were analyzed under &# 39;on/off&# 39; conditions. The six candle types investigated were: (1) Clean cotton (CT), (2) Floral (FL), (3) Kiwi melon (KW), (4) Strawberry (SB), (5) Vanilla (VN), and (6) Plain (PL). Although {{a large number of}} chemicals were released both before lighting and when lit, their profiles were noticeably distinguishable. Before lighting, various esters (n= 30) showed the most dominant emissions. When lit, formaldehyde was found to have the highest emission concentration of 2098 ppb (SB), 1022 ppb (Cr), and 925 ppb (PL). In most lit scented candles, there was a general tendency to show increased concentrations of low boiling point compounds. For some scented candle products, the emission of volatiles occurred strongly both before lighting and when lit. For instance, in terms of TVOC (ppbC), the highest concentrations were observed from the KW product with their values of 12, 742 (on) and 2766 ppbC (off). As such, the results suggest that certain scented candle products should act as potent sources of VOC emission in indoor environment, regardless of conditions - whether being lit or not.
