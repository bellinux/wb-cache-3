40|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{accidents}} {{can have}} devastating {{consequences for the}} welfare of animals being transported yet {{little is known about the}} characteristics of these accidents in the UK. This study obtained details of 207 <b>livestock</b> <b>vehicle</b> accidents that occurred in the UK between 2003 - 2013 from internet media reports and archive newspaper records. A highly significant difference (P< 0. 005) was found in the frequency of accidents at different times of the day with 43 % occurring between 7 am and 11 am. A significant difference (P< 0. 005) was also found in the distribution of accidents throughout the year with notable increases in October and November. Cattle were involved in the most accidents (41 %), followed by sheep (26 %), pigs (15 %) and chickens (15 %). Accurate livestock casualty numbers could not be obtained, but the results indicated the vast majority of animals killed were chickens. The majority of accidents only involved the <b>livestock</b> <b>vehicle</b> (78 %), with large transporters being involved in most incidents (72 %). There was a highly significant difference (P< 0. 001) in the causes of accidents with overturning being the main reason; caused by a sudden and substantial shift in livestock position. All livestock are at risk in large transporters; whilst cattle face additional risks when towed in trailers behind 4 x 4 vehicles. Two factors contribute to overturning accidents; poor driving style and commercial <b>livestock</b> <b>vehicle</b> design. Driving style can be improved through training and reduced pressure on drivers, whilst better vehicle design can be achieved by adopting new technologies and changing some industry practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{domestic}} livestock industry, economic damages {{of livestock}} farmhouses have been increased because the livestock mortality rate grows {{due to the}} spread of infectious animal diseases. The main cause of animal disease spread is a lack of systems to manage livestock vehicles transporting livestock or feed etc. This paper proposes a <b>livestock</b> <b>vehicle</b> management system based on Android for solving such a problem. The proposed system could prevent the spread of animal diseases in advance by collecting and analyzing the moving routes and access information of livestock-related vehicles. It could monitor moving routes of the contamination-suspected vehicles that visited a farm where the animal disease broke out. It is expected to prevent the livestock disease spread in advance through prompt initial prevention such as controlling the movement of vehicles by systematically collecting and managing information on vehicles accessing to livestock farmhouses through this system...|$|E

40|$|Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) {{are among}} the most widely-distributed mammals in the world and have the highest {{reproductive}} output compared with other ungulates. Worldwide, feral hogs are increasing in range and numbers. Human–feral hog conflicts include impact on abundance and richness of plant and animal species, crop damage, predation on <b>livestock,</b> <b>vehicle</b> collisions, and disease transmission. We reviewed methods employed to mitigate the impact of feral hogs on human activities and discussed these methods in terms of effectiveness, feasibility, costs, and social acceptance. Traditional methods of control include trapping, angering, shooting, poisoning, and Judas hogs. Nonlethal methods of control include fertility control, fencing, repellents, diversionary feeding, and translocation. The review indicated that successful eradications of feral hogs from islands have been achieved by combining different control methods and by establishing post-eradication monitoring to ascertain that the eradication had been completed. Conversely, on the mainland and in countries where feral hogs have long been established, management of human–feral hog conflicts often relies on population size reduction through hunting and poisoning the animals or on exclusion fencing and diversionary feeding. In the majority of instances, population control is not based on previous knowledge of local densities or on predicted impact of control on population size. Based on these results, we propose a framework of criteria to guide decisions regarding the suitability of different options to manage human–feral hog conflicts in different contexts...|$|E

40|$|Nassella trichotoma (Nees) Hack. ex Arechav. (common name, {{serrated}} tussock) occupies {{large areas}} of south-eastern Australia and has considerable scope for expansion in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. This highly invasive grass reduces pasture productivity and {{has the potential to}} severely affect the region’s economy by decreasing the livestock carrying capacity of grazing land. Other potential consequences of this invasion include increased fuel loads and displacement of native plants, thereby threatening biodiversity. Rural property owners in the Northern Tablelands were sent a mail questionnaire that examined use of measures to prevent new outbreaks of the weed. The questionnaire was sent to professional farmers as well as lifestyle farmers (owners of rural residential blocks and hobby farms) and 271 responses were obtained (a response rate of 18 %). Key findings were respondents’ limited capacity to detect N. trichotoma, and low adoption of precautions to control seed spread by <b>livestock,</b> <b>vehicles</b> and machinery.

40|$|Modern swine {{production}} systems represent complex and dynamic networks involving numerous stakeholders. For instance, livestock transporters carry live animals between fattening sites, abattoirs, and other premises {{on a daily}} basis. This interconnected system may {{increase the risk of}} microbial spread within and between networks, although little information is available in that regard. In the present study, a swine network composed of 10 finishing farms, one abattoir, and three types of stakeholders (veterinarians, livestock transporters, and nutritional technicians) in Quebec, Canada, was selected to investigate specific vectors and reservoirs of enteric viruses. Environmental samples were collected from the premises over a 12 - month period. Samples were screened using targeted reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing of two selected viral markers, group A rotaviruses (RVA) and porcine astroviruses (PoAstV), both prevalent and genetically heterogeneous swine enteric viruses. The results revealed frequent contamination of farm sites (21. 4 to 100 %), <b>livestock</b> transporter <b>vehicles</b> (30. 6 to 68. 8 %) and, most importantly, the abattoir yard (46. 7 to 94. 1 %), depending on the sample types. Although high levels of strain diversity for both viruses were found, identical PoAstV and RVA strains were detected in specific samples from farms, the abattoir yard, and the <b>livestock</b> transporter <b>vehicle,</b> suggesting interconnections between these premises and transporters. Overall, the results from this study underscore the potential role of abattoirs and livestock transport as a reservoir and transmission route for enteric viruses within and between animal production networks, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Medusahead is {{a winter}} annual, germinating {{in the fall}} and {{undergoing}} root growth in the winter and early spring. Since its roots develop early and reach deep in the soil, it outcompetes native plants for moisture. It flowers in early spring, and by June or July its seeds, which are covered with tiny barbs, are mature. The barbs help the seeds attach to <b>livestock,</b> humans or <b>vehicles</b> that pass by. As the grass grows it accumulates silica, making it unpalatable to livestock except for early in its life cycle. It creates a dense layer of litter, and because of the silica content, the litter decomposes more slowly than that of other plants. This litter suppresses native plant growth while encouraging the germination of its own seed, and after a few years it creates an enormous load of dry fuel that can lead to wildfires.|$|R

40|$|When {{animals are}} exposed to a novel {{situation}} such as transportation, they react by eliciting certain physiological and behavioural functions in order {{to cope with the}} situation. These changes can be measured to indicate how much stress the animal is suffering. Physiological stress indicators often measured in animal transport research include changes in heart rate, live-weight, cortisol levels, and blood composition including electrolytes, metabolites and enzymes (Broom and Johnson, 1993). Animal behavioural stress indicators include struggling, vocalisation, kicking or biting, hunching of the back, urination, defecation and recumbence (Broom et al. 1996; Gregory, 1998). Meat quality parameters post mortem can also help to indicate stress levels in animals (Grandin, 1990; Gregory, 1998). These include incidence of bruising and DFD in all farm animal species and PSE in pigs. Mortality is also an obvious indicator of poor welfare. Combined aspects of transport that contribute to causing stress in livestock include loading and unloading procedures, close proximity to stock handlers, water/feed deprivation, noise, riding in a truck, mixing with other animals and being forced into unfamiliar environments. The responses of stock to these conditions will depend on the animal's genetically controlled adaptability, physical condition and its previous handling experiences (Gross and Siegel, 1993). Factors such as the adequate preparation of animals for transport, controlled prior access to feed and water, minimal disruption to social groups, considerate animal handling skills, adequate handling and transport facilities including good ventilation in trucks, and careful driving technique are major areas that dictate the standard of animal transport. For example, considerations for pigs should include a pre-transport fasting period which balances the requirement to avoid hunger, travel sickness and deaths. Breeding and selecting for more stress-resistant genotypes of pigs can improve the welfare by reducing mortality and the metabolic consequences of transport stress. Other factors influencing animal transport include farm size and country size. For example, livestock transport in Scandinavia involves transport vehicles travelling to more than one farm in order to fill a vehicle. In Australia often one farm pick up can fill a truck, and although the distances may be much longer to the abattoir, it will be more direct. The market demand dictates the type of animals transported. For example the veal trade in Europe demands young live calves to be transported over long distances from northern countries which supply it to the southern countries which demand it. This trade exists in live animals rather than meat because the demanding countries further fatten and slaughter these animals specific to their needs. The industry set up influences the standard of animal transport in different countries. For example in countries where industries are vertically integrated consisting of producer-owned slaughter plant co-operatives (Sweden and Denmark), producers are paid according to slaughter weight and lean meat percentage, therefore there is more consistent quality control measures in place. In Australia the marketing system is such that it provides no economic incentive to reduce losses. Greater public awareness of animal welfare seems to be increasing in western countries, and as a result there is more pressure on the livestock industry to adopt better standards for the farming, handling, transport and slaughter of animals. The transport of livestock in Australia continues to be under increased scrutiny from overseas markets and animal welfare groups. In the European Union (EU), public pressure has been a successful instigator to the drafting and continued improvement of comprehensive legislation for animal transport. EU animal transport laws cover aspects such as minimum design standards for <b>livestock</b> <b>vehicles</b> (including ventilation controls), maximum journey lengths before resting intervals, stocking rates, what animals are considered as fit to travel, and general handling and care requirements of animals in transport. These laws are causing debate between northern and southern countries in areas such as maximum journey lengths and vehicle design standards. Some countries such as the UK have also gone to a great effort to adjust national laws in order to incorporate EU transport laws, but countries such as Spain and Italy have not. Typically it is these countries that more often have poor standards of animal welfare, and the welfare of farmed animals has historically been of low priority (Schmidt, 1995). When and how these countries will adopt the comprehensive EU animal transport regulations, continues to be an unanswered and politically sensitive question between EU member states...|$|R
40|$|Purple loosestrife was {{introduced}} to North America from Europe and Asia {{in the early to}} mid 1800 ’s. The seeds were carried in ship ballast and on livestock that were brought to this country for trade. Purple loosestrife was widely cultivated for its ornamental and pharmacological values. But this species can invade wetland habitats and result in negative im-pacts on the ecosystem. Such ecosystem effects include altered detritus decomposition and nutrient cycling. Also, purple loosestrife may displace native plant species, forming dense monotypic stands that reduce native plant species richness and diversity. Purple loosestrife has little value for wildlife as few species utilize the plant for a food source or shelter. Regulations Purple loosestrife is not listed as a federal noxious weed. It is listed as a state noxious weed in Arkansas and South Carolina, and a Class B noxious weed in Alabama and North Carolina. It is widely recognized as an invasive weed of wetlands. Description Vegetative growth Purple loosestrife is a perennial species that over-winters as a stem base. Plants are composed of numerous angled stems that grow to over 6 feet. The leaves are lance shaped with fine hairs, and are attached directly to the stems with-out petioles. Leaves can be opposite, whorled, or spiraled around the stem. Flowering/fruiting Purple flowers occur in axillary clusters that form a spike inflorescence. Each flower has 5 - 7 narrow, wrinkled purple pet-als. Flowering begins in late June and continues through September. It has been suggested that purple loosestrife can draw pollinators away from native plants, which may aid in this plants prolific seed production. A mature multi-stemmed plant, 1. 5 - 6 feet in height, may produce between two and three million seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. It takes approximately eight weeks from germination for purple loosestrife to flower. Dispersal mechanisms Seed move by drifting in moving water. Long-distance transport occurs when seeds become embedded in mud adhering to wildlife, <b>livestock,</b> humans, and <b>vehicles.</b> The weed spreads vegetatively by detached shoot and rootstock fragments...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Iran is {{a country}} {{with one of the}} highest rates of traffic crash {{fatality}} and injury, and seventy percent of these fatalities happen on rural roads. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the significant factors influencing injury severity among drivers involved in crashes on two kinds of major rural roads in Iran: two-lane, two-way roads and freeways. METHODS: According to the dataset, 213569 drivers were involved in rural road crashes in Iran, over the 3 years from 2006 to 2008. The Classification And Regression Tree method (CART) was applied for 13 independent variables, and one target variable of injury severity with 3 classes of no-injury, injury and fatality. Some of the independent variables were cause of crash, collision type, weather conditions, road surface conditions, driver's age and gender and seat belt usage. The CART model was trained by 70 % of these data, and tested with the rest. RESULTS: It was indicated that seat belt use is the most important safety factor for two-lane, two-way rural roads, but on freeways, the importance of this variable is less. Cause of crash, also turned out to be the next most important variable. The results showed that for two-lane, two-way rural roads, "improper overtaking" and "speeding", and for rural freeways, "inattention to traffic ahead", "vehicle defect", and "movement of pedestrians, <b>livestock</b> and unauthorized <b>vehicles</b> on freeways" are the most serious causes of increasing injury severity. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis results revealed seat belt use, cause of crash and collision type as the most important variables influencing the injury severity of traffic crashes. To deal with these problems, intensifying police enforcement by means of mobile patrol vehicles, constructing overtaking lanes where necessary, and prohibiting the crossing of pedestrians and livestock and the driving of unauthorized vehicles on freeways are necessary. Moreover, creating a rumble strip on the two edges of roads, and paying attention to the design consistency of roads can be a helpful factor in order to prevent events such as "overturning" and improve the overall safety of freeways...|$|R
