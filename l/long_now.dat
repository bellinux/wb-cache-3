5|$|The term 'clock' {{encompasses}} {{a wide spectrum}} of devices, ranging from wristwatches to the Clock of the <b>Long</b> <b>Now.</b> The English word clock is said to derive from the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell, and are derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys.|$|E

For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck <b>Long,</b> <b>now</b> a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was {{at the bottom of a}} pile of fans.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres <b>long,</b> <b>now</b> known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E

25|$|The probe {{is named}} after the Rosetta Stone, a stele of Egyptian origin {{featuring}} a decree in three scripts.

A comparison of its hieroglyphs with those on the Rosetta Stone catalysed the deciphering of the Egyptian writing system. Similarly, {{it is hoped that}} these spacecraft will result in better understanding of comets and the early Solar System. In a more direct analogy to its namesake, the Rosetta spacecraft also carries a micro-etched pure nickel prototype of the Rosetta disc donated by the <b>Long</b> <b>Now</b> Foundation. The disc is inscribed with 6,500 pages of language translations.|$|E

25|$|In 1258, a Mongol column under Uriyangkhadai, {{the son of}} Subutai, invaded Đại Việt. A {{battle was}} fought in which the Vietnamese used war elephants. Aju ordered his troops to fire arrows at the elephants' feet. The animals turned in panic and caused {{disorder}} in the Đại Việt army, which was routed. The King of Đại Việt fled to an offshore island, and the Mongols occupied the capital city Thăng <b>Long</b> (<b>now</b> Hanoi). When they found their envoys in prison, one of whom died, they responded by massacring {{the population of the}} capital. Though the Mongols retained supremacy on land, their forces were unable to withstand the tropical heat, mosquitoes, and malaria, and after securing a submission and promise of tribute from the Dai Viet King, Uriyangkhadai ordered a retreat.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the election Law held the support of no more than 40 of the 270 members of parliament; the remaining 130 were divided between Long and Chamberlain. Although Long believed he had the most MPs, his support was largely amongst backbenchers, and most of the whips and frontbenchers preferred Chamberlain. With Long and Chamberlain almost neck-and-neck they called a meeting on 9 November to discuss the possibility of a deadlock. Chamberlain suggested that he would withdraw if this became a strong possibility, assuming Long did the same. <b>Long,</b> <b>now</b> concerned that his weak health would not allow him to survive the stress of party leadership, agreed. Both withdrew on 10 November, and on 13 November 232 MPs assembled at the Carlton Club, and Law was nominated as leader by Long and Chamberlain. With the unanimous support of the MPs, Law became Leader of the Conservative Party despite never having sat in Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|After {{learning}} about actions of Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh, Nguyễn Huệ sent north a general named Vũ Văn Nhậm with an army to attack Thăng <b>Long</b> (<b>now</b> Hanoi). Vu Van Nham swiftly defeated and killed Nguyen Huu Chinh and occupied Thăng Long, {{but then he}} took the power himself. Nguyễn Huệ sent two other generals to suppress Vu Van Nham and recaptured Thăng Long. Meanwhile, Lê Chiêu Thống fled to the furthest north of Vietnam and refused Nguyễn Huệ's invitations to return. He gathered {{a small army of}} Lê dynasty loyalists and sent his family to China to seek aid from the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire. The Qianlong Emperor agreed and sent a massive army to north Vietnam. Under the banner of the Lê king, the large Qing army easily drove Tây Sơn out of north Vietnam and took over Thăng Long. After the Qing occupation of northern Vietnam, the Qing viceroy Sun Shiyi reinstalled Lê Chiêu Thống as a puppet ruler. Although Lê Chiêu Thống did not have much ruling power, he began taking a bloody revenge on Tây Sơn supporters and forced people to supply him food in spite of war and famine.|$|E

25|$|The second Mongol {{invasion}} of Đại Việt began late in 1284, when the Mongol Yuan forces {{under the command}} of Toghan, the prince of Kublai Khan, crossed the border and quickly occupied Thăng <b>Long</b> (<b>now</b> Hanoi) in January 1285, after the victorious battle of Omar in Vạn Kiếp (north east of Hanoi). At the same time Sogetu, second in command of the Yuan army, moved from Champa northward and rapidly marched to Nghe An in the north central region of Vietnam, where the army of the Trần dynasty under general Trần Kien was defeated and surrendered to him. However, the Trần king and the commander-in-chief Trần Hưng Đạo changed their tactics from defence to attack and struck against the Mongols. In April, General Trần Quang Khải defeated Sogetu in Chương Dương and the Trần king won a battle in Tây Kết, where Sogetu died. Soon after, general Trần Nhật Duật also won a battle in Hàm Tử (now Hưng Yên) and Toghan was defeated by General Trần Hưng Đạo. Thus Kublai failed in his first attempt to invade Đại Việt. Toghan hid himself inside a bronze pipe to avoid being killed by the Đại Việt archers; this act brought humiliation upon the Mongol Empire and Toghan himself.|$|E

500|$|Li Long is an assassin, {{who failed}} in {{a mission to}} kill {{the leader of a}} Japanese pirate faction.

The tone of the show variated from the beginning: for the performance of [...] "Born to Make You Happy", Spears sang in a set resembling a children's bedroom, complete with large toys and a pillow fight routine. On the contrary, she unveiled a more sophisticated image for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", and followed it with raunchy performances for [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Oops!...
