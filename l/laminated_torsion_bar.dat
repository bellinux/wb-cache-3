5000|$|In Germany {{the motor}} {{industry}} was {{devastated by the}} war, however {{a small number of}} manufacturers brought it to prominence once more. In 1948-9 the first Porsche appeared under the aegis of Dr. Ferry Porsche, son of Ferdinand Porsche. In 1957, author John Stanford wrote that the original Porsche 356 was [...] "an 1100-c.c. version of the Volkswagen, itself a pre-war Porsche design, differing only in the most elegant, light and low-drag coachwork which has since become familiar. Since then numerous design changes have taken place and except for general layout the car has little in common with its parent. All models except the sports-racing [...] "Carerra" [...] and [...] "Spyder" [...] have had an opposed four-cylinder air-cooled engine set behind and driving the rear axle, a four-speed gearbox with Porsche's own excellent synchromesh, and <b>laminated</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension to all wheels. The short stroke of the engines has meant exceptionally long life and hard-wearing qualities, and the beautifully profiled coachwork has led to exceptionally refined high performance in view of their modest engine size. This has been progressively increased to the current 1488-c.c. and 1582-c.c. sizes, and the cars are geared to sustain cruising speeds comfortably near their top speed, which varies between 90 and 110 mph; the most popular of the series weighs only 16 cwt. As much as any current production car the Porsche represents to the smallest detail the very definite ideas of its designers as to what constitutes agreeable fast motoring. Future historians must see them as among the most important of mid-century production cars." [...] Stanford thought the contemporary German Mercedes 300SL just as remarkable, and it is covered in the accompanying grand tourer article.|$|E
50|$|The usual Daimler large {{cruciform}} chassis had {{a double}} wishbone front suspension, with <b>laminated</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> telescopic dampers, and an anti-roll bar, while the rear suspension used leaf springs with telescopic dampers.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} of box section and {{cruciform}} braced. Suspension was independent in front using <b>laminated</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> with a torsional stabilising bar. At the rear there were half-elliptic springs. Girling hydraulic shock absorbers and Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were fitted.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive spring rate. In most <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply adjusting bolts that connect the <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> to the steering knuckles. In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for a different spring rate is usually an easy task.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Synchronization <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{key part}} in {{independent}} and dependent impression mechanism which ensures synchronization motion {{at both ends of}} blanket cylinder. Due to frequent action of the mechanism in high-speed printing, synchronization <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> would cause huge impact torque so as to affect parallel shifting of blanket cylinder and uniformity of printing impression. Based on structure features and force of synchronization <b>torsion</b> <b>bar,</b> finite element model of synchronization <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> was established by adopting structural mechanics and finite element method, then static stiffness of synchronization <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> was solved by adopting principle of minimum potential energy. The result of computation shows that the maximum torsion deformation of <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> in X direction happens at the left connection point. Because the deformation is very small, the bar can meet the requirements that blanket cylinder...|$|R
5000|$|One {{design for}} {{measuring}} the torque applied to the steering wheel has a torque sensor - a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> {{at the lower end}} of the steering column. As the steering wheel rotates, so does the steering column, as well as the upper end of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar.</b> Since the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> is relatively thin and flexible, and the bottom end usually resists being rotated, the bar will twist by an amount proportional to the applied torque. The difference in position between the opposite ends of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> controls a valve. The valve allows fluid to flow to the cylinder which provides steering assistance; the greater the [...] "twist" [...] of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar,</b> the greater the force.|$|R
50|$|A {{control arm}} {{may be used}} to carry the {{suspension}} load and transmit them to the spring or shock absorber. <b>Torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension commonly does this, with the outboard end of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> attached to the inboard bearing of the control arm.|$|R

50|$|When {{steering}} effort is applied {{at the wheel}} it is transmitted to the rotor, which transmits the effort to the hour glass cam {{by means of the}} <b>torsion</b> <b>bar.</b> The rotor is normally centred in its sleeve by the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> but manual {{steering effort}} twists the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar,</b> permitting the rotor to turn within its sleeve, opening the way for hydraulic fluid pressure to be applied to one or other side of the servo piston, thus assisting in turning the front wheels.|$|R

50|$|Front {{suspension}} was MacPherson-like with <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> {{instead of}} springs, to allow {{room for the}} wide V6 and the optional air conditioning.

5000|$|Independent {{front wheel}} {{springing}} was {{provided in the}} form of parallel links with coil springs, radius arms and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> damping. The rear half-elliptical springs also were given a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> stabilizer and hydraulic shock absorbers. They were rubber-mounted to minimise vibration. The exhaust system was also insulated.|$|R
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM {{passenger car}} application of <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|R
5000|$|Many {{contemporary}} main {{battle tanks}} use <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension, including the American M1 Abrams, German Leopard 2, and Chinese MBT-3000, though the newest generation of tanks {{such as the}} Russian T-14 Armata utilize an adjustable hydraulic suspension. [...] Due to their small size, tremendous load capacity, and relative ease of service, <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension has been ideal for tanks, {{though it is not}} without disadvantage. The large travel and high elasticity of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> results in a [...] "rocking" [...] motion when the tank is moving or coming to a sudden stop. A gun stabilizer must be used to compensate for the rocking motion. Due to the massive weight of a main battle tank, compared to an automobile, there is a much greater risk of breaking a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> on sudden bumps or maneuvers, and if it is not replaced in short order the reduced suspension can affect the maneuverability of the vehicle, and in extreme cases risk immobilizing the vehicle as the reduced capacity of the suspension causes additional <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> to break.|$|R

50|$|An early {{application}} of a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> in an American car was by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit who had introduced the innovative front axle flex suspension in 1934 Hudson and Terraplane cars and realized for 1935 that a transverse <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> linked to the rear axle was needed as an anti-roll bar to stabilize the cars. The single <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> was mounted through the frame sides behind the rear axle and then attached by arms and links to the front side of the spring U-bolt plates. Axle flex was discontinued for the 1936 model year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} American {{passenger}} car application was the Chrysler system used {{beginning with the}} 1957 model year in cars such as the Imperial Crown series, although Chrysler's [...] "Torsion-Aire" [...] suspension was only for the front; the same basic system (longitudinal mounting) was maintained until the 1981 introduction of the K-car. A reengineered <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension, introduced with the 1976 Dodge Aspen, introduced transverse-mounted <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> (possibly based on the Volkswagen Type 3 passenger car) until production ended in 1989 (with Chrysler's M platform). Some generations of the Dodge Dakota and Durango used <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> on the front suspension.|$|R

40|$|PavementME Design {{is based}} on mechanistic-empirical principles, which take the {{properties}} of layer materials into account in predicting pavement responses and performance. Of these principles, dynamic modulus {{is one of the}} most important. Dynamic modulus measures strain in response to the applied stress, which mimics loads from traffic and the corresponding deformation of the asphalt pavement. The traditional test for dynamic modulus in the uniaxial configuration cannot be performed on field cores due to lift thickness. Owing to that, the Indirect Tension and <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> configuration were developed. This research will focus on the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar,</b> which requires specimens that are 10 x 12 x 50 mm per ASTM D 7552 - 09. The smaller size of <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> specimens is convenient for forensic evaluation. However, due to the small size of specimens, there are challenges with obtaining a sample that is representative of the global properties of the test material when the nominal maximum aggregate size, NMAS, is 12. 5 mm or greater. The goal of this project is to determine if using aggregates of larger NMAS in asphalt concrete mixtures influences the shear dynamic modulus. Mixtures with a NMAS of 9. 5 mm and 25 mm were tested. The results from the <b>Torsion</b> <b>Bar</b> test were used to generate master curves for each mix design using the time-temperature superposition technique. The results were analyzed by comparing test results from <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> test to other specimens of different NMAS and asphalt binders. Based on the analysis, the conclusion is the shear dynamic modulus from the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> configuration is affected by the nominal maximum aggregate size used in asphalt concrete mixtures, `and the binder does not influence the results. RVE for <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> specimens falls between 9. 5 mm and 25 mm, or even smaller...|$|R

5000|$|The German World War II Panther tank (and some Tigers) had double <b>torsion</b> <b>bars.</b> [...] Needing bars {{longer than}} {{the width of the}} tank to get the {{required}} spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the suspension arm, while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On {{the opposite side of the}} tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection of the suspension arm caused both halves of the double <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> to twist. A disadvantage of the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch.|$|R
