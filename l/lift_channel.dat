By mid-1822, managing director Josiah White was consulting with Canvass White, an veteran designing engineer of New York's Erie Canal locks, and by late 1822 had shifted construction efforts from bolstering and improving the one-way system begun in 1818 with an ambitious two-way dams and lock construction test project on the four upper dams of the Canal which were designed with a wider <b>lift</b> <b>channel</b> and length of over 120 ft capable of taking both a steam tug and a coastal cargo ship.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new wavelet family for lossless image compression by re-factoring the channel {{representation of the}} update-then-predict lifting wavelet, introduced by Claypoole, Davis, Sweldens and Baraniuk, into lifting steps. We name the new wavelet family as invertible update-then-predict integer lifting wavelets (IUPILWs for short). To build IUPILWs, we investigate some central issues such as normalization, invertibility, integer structure, and scaling <b>lifting.</b> The <b>channel</b> representation of the previous update-then-predict lifting wavelet with normalization is given and the invertibility is discussed firstly. To guarantee the invertibility, we re-factor the <b>channel</b> representation into <b>lifting</b> steps. Then the integer structure and scaling lifting of the invertible update-then-predict wavelet are given and the IUPILWs are built. Experiments show that comparing with the integer lifting structure of 5 / 3 wavelet, 9 / 7 wavelet, and iDTT, IUPILW results in the lower bit-rates for lossless image compression.|$|R

This paper will discuss how computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to explore various options to modify the fishway entrance geometry and to effectively dissipate the energy of high velocity flows leaving the spillway apron near the fishway entrance. In particular, three options to improve fishway entrance flow conditions will be presented, including removal of the present entrance deflector wall, use of a fish-friendly turbine discharge, and adding a plunge pool in the spillway apron. For each option, the results of CFD simulations will be presented with {{an evaluation of the}} probable impact of flow patterns on upstream fish passage...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} formulation for Eulerian-Lagrangian {{simulations of}} particle-laden flows in complex geometries is developed. The formulation {{accounts for the}} finite-size of the dispersed phase. Similar to the commonly used point-particle formulation, the dis-persed particles are treated as point-sources, and the forces acting on the particles are modeled through drag and lift correlations. In addition to the interphase momentum exchange, the presence of particles affects the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations through the displaced fluid volume. Three flow configurations are consid-ered in order to study the effect of finite particle size size on the overall flowfield: a) gravitational settling, b) fluidization by a gaseous jet, and c) fluidization by <b>lift</b> in a <b>channel.</b> The finite-size formulation is compared to point-particle representations, which do {{not account for the}} effect of finite size. It is shown that the fluid displaced by the particles {{plays an important role in}} predicting the correct behavior of parti-cle motion. The results suggest that the standard point-particle approach should be modified to account for finite particle size, in simulations of particle-laden flows...|$|R
40|$|The 6 -month long {{eruption}} at Holuhraun (August 2014 –February 2015) in the Bárðarbunga-Veiðivötn volcanic {{system was}} the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the 1783 – 1784 CE Laki eruption. The lava flow field covered ~ 84 km 2 and has an estimated bulk (i. e., including vesicles) volume of ~ 1. 44 km 3. The eruption had an average discharge rate of ~ 90 m 3 /s making it the longest effusive eruption in modern times to sustain such high average flux. The {{first phase of the}} eruption (August 31, 2014 to mid-October 2014) had a discharge rate of ~ 350 to 100 m 3 /s and was typified by lava transport via open channels and the formation of four lava flows, no. 1 – 4,which were emplaced side by side. The eruption began on a 1. 8 km long fissure, feeding partly incandescent sheets of slabby pāhoehoe up to 500 m wide. By the following day the lava transport got confined to open channels and the dominant lava morphology changed to rubbly pāhoehoe and ‘a’ā. The latter became the dominating morphology of lava flows no. 1 – 8. The second phase of the eruption (Mid-October to end November) had a discharge of ~ 100 – 50 m 3 /s. During this time the lava transport system changed, via the formation of a b 1 km 2 lava pond ~ 1 km east of the vent. The pond most likely formed in a topographical low created by a the pre-existing Holuhraun and the newHoluhraun lava flow fields. This pond became themain point of lava distribution, controlling the emplacement of subsequent flows (i. e. no. 5 – 8). Towards the end of this phase inflation plateaus developed in lava flowno. 1. These inflation plateaus were the surface manifestation of a growing lava tube system, which formed as lava ponded in the open lava channels creating sufficient lavastatic pressure in the fluid lava to lift the roof of the lava channels. This allowed new lava into the previously active lava <b>channel</b> <b>lifting</b> the <b>channel</b> roof via inflation. The final (third) phase, lasting from December to end-February 2015 had a mean discharge rate of ~ 50 m 3 /s. In this phase the lava transport was mainly confined to lava tubes within lava flows no. 1 – 2, which fed breakouts that resurfaced N 19 km 2 of the flow field. The primary lava morphology from this phase was spiny pāhoehoe, which superimposed on the ‘a’ā lava flows no. 1 – 3 and extended {{the entire length of the}} flow field (i. e. 17 km). Thismade the 2014 – 2015 Holuhraun a paired flow field,where both lava morphologies had similar length. We suggest that the similar length is a consequence of the pāhoehoe is fed from the tube systemutilizing the existing ‘a’ā lava channels, and thereby are controlled by the initial length of the ‘a’ā flows.

40|$|The {{original}} ARID (Algae Raceway Integrated Design) raceway was {{an effective}} method to increase temperature toward the optimal growth range. However, the energy input {{was high and}} flow mixing was poor. Thus, the ARID-HV (High Velocity Algae Raceway Integrated Design) raceway was developed to reduce energy input requirements and improve flow mixing. This was accomplished by improving pumping efficiency and using a serpentine flow pattern in which the water flows through channels instead of over barriers. A prototype ARID-HV system was installed in Tucson, Arizona, and the constructability, reliability of components, drainage of channels, and flow and energy requirements of the ARID-HV raceway were evaluated. Each of the electrical energy inputs to the raceway (air sparger, air tube blower, canal <b>lift</b> pump, and <b>channel</b> recirculation pump) was quantified, some by direct measurement and others by simulation. An algae growth model {{was used to determine}} the algae production rate vs. flow depth and time of year. Then the electrical energy requirement of the most effective flow depth was calculated. Channel hydraulics was evaluated with Manning's equation and the corner head loss equation. In this way, the maximum length of channels for several raceway slopes and mixing velocities were determined. Algae production in the ARID-HV raceway was simulated with a temperature and light growth model. An energy efficient design for the ARID-HV raceway was developed...|$|R
