The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> such as hairless rats.|$|E
25|$|Positions on the {{existence}} of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it),</b> while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it).</b> Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. Apatheism concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century Commonwealth {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} incompetent kings of foreign origin whose main interest was fighting personal wars against other countries. Persistent wars and general turmoil bankrupted the national finances, and many power-hungry Magnates cooperated with foreign forces. The last king, Poniatowski, was paid by Catherine II of Russia and was obliged to report to Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. He was furthermore richly paid to facilitate the constitution of May 3, 1791 but because of his character or rather <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> he did not fulfill his promise. On the other hand, Poniatowski did care about cultural life in Poland, supported necessary education of young patriots and also did not go against members of the Bar confederation.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{during the}} {{testimony}} of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either {{that he has been}} consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which such statements could become admissible in evidence (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of such statements once admitted. Formerly, such statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, such statements are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just of credibility, and so are now hearsay.|$|E

25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E
25|$|While {{she was in}} Qazvin, her uncle, Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, was murdered, and {{the blame}} for this placed on her by her husband, even though she denied any involvement. Baraghani had been an inveterate enemy of Shaykh Ahmad. During Táhirih's stay in Qazvin, Baraghani had {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} sermons in which he attacked the Báb and his followers. There is no hard evidence as to the identity of the murderer, nor any proof as to Táhirih's involvement or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> With her arrest Táhirih’s powerful father convinced the authorities that rather than kill Táhirih, she would be imprisoned in her home. Táhirih’s father kept her under house-arrest in his cellar, appointing her maids to act as spies. Though interpreted as a cruel act in Root’s interviews with family members of Táhirih one claimed this was done out of genuine fear for her safety. Her father was convinced of his daughters’ innocence, but her husband was violently against her. He argued that Táhirih be put on trial for the murder of her uncle. Her father positively refused citing Táhirih would never leave her home. Nevertheless, authorities forcefully arrested Táhirih and one of her maids in the hope that she would testify against her.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{the levels}} of service {{available}} will {{fall into one of}} three categories; Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning nurses and/or physicians working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, and where it is present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include Emergency Medical Technician, Ambulance Technician, or Paramedic. These ambulance care givers are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the environment in which they operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.|$|E

500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> their attitude toward their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label.
