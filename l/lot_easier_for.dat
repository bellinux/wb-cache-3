25|$|In children, living liver donor transplantations {{have become}} very accepted. The {{accessibility}} of adult parents who want to donate {{a piece of the}} liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant.

40|$|Mechanisms of {{intervention}} and the contexts {{they are used}} in interact in complex ways. This helps explain why we can’t overgeneralize about what works in respect of models of service designed to prevent or respond to homelessness. This said there are some key messages from the totality of evidence that has been accumulated to date. First homelessness would be a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to prevent <b>for</b> first or subsequent episodes if adequate and appropriate (developmentally/ culturally) housing was available. Second (and often dependent on the first) timely support of a particular character ‘works’ both in a preventive sense and in periods when people experience ongoing challenges which may render them vulnerable to further homelessness. This paper reflects {{on some of the}} critical features of how we can generate and use evidence, and how these complement each other in important ways...|$|R

This system {{divided the}} Tucuman {{province}} into four systematic areas with San Miguel being in its own area. Each area has its own public hospitals and Health Primary Attention Centers for the people. This divisions purpose was to help regulate health care assistance across the population and make it more accessible.

This provides an insight into how the development of digital technologies has changed the methods of promotion in the music industry. In particular discussing how the artist and fan relationship has changed due {{to the development of}} social media and the potential options this platform gives artists in connecting with fans. The importance of motion graphics is discussed in relation to music video production. Artists are now recognizing the wide variety of options it opens in the creativity of a music video. The options available for this projectʼs music video, is explored and a concept based video is developed through the application of an illustrative style and communication of a theme. The successfulness and effectiveness of this approach is proven from external feedback and critical analysis throughout the process. The impact of digital technologies is explored in depth as it has influenced great change within both the music industry and motion graphic industry. Technologies have made it a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> and quicker <b>for</b> motion graphics work to be completed and has made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the music industry to access. The aim of this dissertation is to show how motion graphics has {{become a part of the}} music industry due to the development of digital technology and a concept based video is effective as it offers a more unique experience for fan...|$|R
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we tried to do it, it was like, 'She's not going to stop to go out to dinner. She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures it {{out at the end of}} the first season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them.

500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care if I get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} design, {{implement}} and optimization of {{digital front end}} module of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) -Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system on FPGA employing Alamouti Technique (Space Time Block coding). MIMO-OFDM can very effectively be used to achieve higher data rate’s and higher reliability {{and this is going}} to be the Key for 4 G Technology. MIMO -OFDM designed in this work consists of Input/Output Memory, 16 QAM Modulator, MIMO Encoder (Space Time Encoder, Wireless Channel Model, MIMO Decoder Space Time Decoder) and 16 QAM Demodulator. This paper has resulted in the development of a hardware prototype of a MIMO Transmitter, Receiver and channel, which is implemented on a Spartan- 3 FPGA board. As the number format adopted is floating point,there was a need to develop a separate function which will show the equivalent real numbers for the corresponding floating point number. This made the task of debugging a <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> Test benches <b>for</b> individual model were developed and tested it for its correct functionality. The functional simulation was carried out for the entire design. The entire design was mapped on to FPGA. The results were compared with the MATLAB results and were found to be the same...|$|R

This guideline presents key issues related to delivering learning support materials through a VLE, based on perspectives of disabled students and academic staff.

Learning support materials The term learning support materials refers to the online delivery of Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF, web resources, multimedia {{and other forms of}} documentation in support of face-to-face sessions. When learning support materials are delivered through a VLE, students benefit from having a central location for all resources as well as access to digital materials in a variety of flexible formats which {{can be adapted}} to suit their individual needs.
