40|$|In the {{previous}} project, loop joining and loop splitting are {{built as a}} complete loopoperation set for the topological structure of multi-loop surfaces. Based on this tool forchanging surface topological structure, with further consideration on the geometriccharacteristics, a reverse engineering method will be developed for multi-looped surfacemodeling through loop operation on triangular mesh and B-spline surfaces. Firstly, loop joining operations are used to construct a triangular mesh of a surfacemodel from measured 3 D point data. In such way, the validity and integrity of thetopological data for the triangular mesh model can be assured. Subsequently, a series of loopsplitting operations are applied on the triangular mesh which is then subdivided into regionsappropriate for surface fitting. Each region is a single <b>looped</b> <b>surface</b> which can be fitted by aB-spline surface controlled by rectangular array points. The reverse engineering for surfacemodel construction is thus accomplished.

Based on such constructing tool set, a reverse engineering system for surface modeling willbe developed. For the first year, inverse operations corresponding to existing loop joiningoperations {{will be developed}} as loop splitting method for decomposing surfaces. The methodis able to split surfaces and produce recognizable topological variations for loops andsurfaces. Since surfaces can be constructed in two way operations of loop joining and loopsplitting, more alternative operations with better functional convenience are provided forsurface construction process. The accompanying variations of database after each operationwill be correspondingly processed in a strict manner such that the integrity and validity ofthe surface topological data can be assured. Thus, the loop joining and splitting operationswill constitute a sufficiently integral tool set for constructing multi-looped surfaces.

40|$|Seafloor {{morphology}} beyond nine tidewater glaciers terminating in open-marine {{settings in}} eastern Svalbard {{has been investigated}} using multibeam swath-bathymetry. Historical information on tidewater glacier fluctuations {{over the past century}} or so shows that the seafloor offshore has been exposed only recently. Most glaciers have been observed to surge or have <b>looped</b> <b>surface</b> moraines indicating past surges. During these ice advances and subsequent retreat, a well-preserved submarine landform assemblage has been produced. (a) Subglacial landforms include: overridden moraine ridges, mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs), other streamlined lineations, elongate drumlins and medial moraines, small ridges forming a complex boxwork or rhombohedral pattern, and meltwater-related eskers and channels. (b) Ice-marginal landforms include: large terminal moraines with debris flow lobes on their outer flanks and indentations on their inner sides, small transverse retreat moraines, and crater-like kettle holes. (c) Glacimarine features include: iceberg ploughmarks and an otherwise relatively smooth sedimentary seafloor produced by fine-grained debris rain-out. A schematic plan-view landform assemblage model for tidewater glaciers advancing into open-marine settings is developed. Arcuate terminal moraines marking the ice-advance limit provide a distinctive component. Submarine basin(s) exposed inside these moraine ridges when ice retreats contain suites of individual landforms, produced subglacially and ice-marginally, with a consistent order of timing of deposition and stratigraphic superposition. The new schematic model is compared with earlier models based on submarine landforms associated with surges in the more topographically constrained setting of Spitsbergen fjords. Differences include: (i) the overall arcuate shape of the open-marine assemblage; (ii) the indented ice-proximal sides of terminal moraine ridges; (iii) the fan-shaped pattern of streamlined lineations; (iv) crater-like kettle holes at the inner lateral margins of many submarine basins; (v) prominent systems of eskers and channels. Modern glaciological analogues from ongoing surges of ice caps in eastern Svalbard and Severnaya Zemlya provide contemporary observations of ice advance into open-marine settings, including heavily crevassed ice lobes with finger-like termini...|$|E

40|$|A local {{parametrization}} based curvature computation {{technique for}} triangular meshes is presented.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>Loop</b> subdivision <b>surfaces</b> as a surrogate for CAD or analytic-based geometry. The modeler begins by constructing a subdivision surface from a full-resolution imported surface triangulation, and then queries this surface to return information about the model. Evaluations on the surface are performed using a simplified implementation of Stam’s exact evaluation procedure for <b>Loop</b> subdivision <b>surfaces.</b> The paper presents details of this simplified approach and shows {{how it can be}} used to provide surface coordinates, derivatives, and curvatures for evaluations at arbitrary parameter values. The implementation also provides the ability to tag hard-edges (and implicitly hard-vertices) in the imported geometry to preserve creases and points using a one-dimensional cubic-spline scheme which preserves C 2 continuity along hard-edges. Away from hard-edges and vertices, the <b>Loop</b> <b>surface</b> is C 2 continuous everywhere except in the immediate vicinity of irregular vertices in the control-net where it still retains C 1 continuity. Examples are presented using control-nets built from a variety of legacy triangulations with widely varying complexity. To demonstrate the modeler, we use a simplified meshing application which queries arbitrary locations on the surface to support either uniform or curvature-adaptive triangle refinement. The simple evaluation rules for surface coordinates and derivatives make the scheme extremely fast and robust. Since the input triangulation becomes the control-net of the subdivision surface, it is not necessarily an interpolant for the input data. Various approaches for making the surface interpolating are discussed, and this area remains one of active research. 2 Per-Olof Persson, Michael J. Aftosmis, and Robert Haimes...|$|R
