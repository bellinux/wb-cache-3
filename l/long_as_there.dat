5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that {{this is actually a}} romantic Victorian invention.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as the Darling and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semi-desert areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are some scattered trees. In fact, it can adapt to any habitat as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are some trees present.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{received}} a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and {{arrived in the}} colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications {{for the future of}} the Maryland colony and for Carroll.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{planning}} applications were submitted {{for a new}} bridge, the Thames Gateway Bridge, close to the Woolwich Ferry; however the project was cancelled in 2008. In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead expected to open in 2017. The option of a bridge is still popular, with an alternative option of a tunnel in the area. TfL planning director Richard de Cani {{has said that the}} ferry will continue to operate as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are no alternatives, and there are no current plans to discontinue the service.|$|E

5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> {{is at least one}} Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
5|$|The 1790 {{constitution}} {{abolished the}} council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved {{the start of the}} term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is a four-year break after a second term.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a ferry {{operating}} in Woolwich since the 14th century, and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid-19th century. The free service opened in 1889, following the abolition of tolls across bridges {{to the west of}} London. Traffic increased in the 20th century owing to the rise in motor vehicle use, and {{because of the lack of}} nearby fixed crossings of the Thames it has remained popular, although pedestrian use has dropped as a result of the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway through to Woolwich Arsenal station. Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and the Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements, but there are no immediate plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is a demand.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her first}} face turn, Stratus began wrestling part-time. She {{teamed up with}} Lita against then-heels, Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson at InVasion. After {{suffering}} an ankle injury in the summer, however, she was sidelined for the following three months. This interrupted not only her recent venture into wrestling, but also an on-screen romance with Jeff Hardy and budding storyline with Team Xtreme. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting Excess on TNN. After returning in autumn, Stratus appeared at Survivor Series where she won the WWF Women's Championship {{for the first time}} in a six-pack challenge. Stratus was next involved in a feud with Jazz over the Women's Championship, where she retained the championship at the Royal Rumble, but dropped the championship to Jazz two weeks later on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw. Stratus then attempted to regain the title for several months, including competing in a triple threat match at WrestleMania X8 against Lita and Jazz in her hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but failed to win the match. While chasing after the Women's Championship, Stratus won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was a referee present. One week later, she regained the Women's Championship in a tag team match with Bubba Ray Dudley. During this time, Stratus began wrestling solely on the Raw brand after being drafted in the WWF Brand Extension.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves {{enough money to buy}} his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he has returned to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come {{under the control of the}} black man. Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, but as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by the blacks and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E
