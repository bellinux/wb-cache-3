[...] Seward was at first {{recovering}} from his injuries, and Johnson was ill for a time in the summer of 1865. Seward was likely in accord with Johnson's relatively gentle terms for the South's re-entry to the Union, and with his pardon of all Confederates but those of high rank. Radical Republicans such as Stanton and Pennsylvania Representative Thaddeus Stevens proposed that the freed slaves be given the vote, but Seward was content to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the states (few Northern states gave African-Americans the ballot), believing the priority should be reconciling the power-holding white populations of the North and South to each other.|$|E

It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil.

Maalim did not elaborate on what exactly Ethiopia's role would be, stating that [...] "We <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the national security forces to decide." [...] On 25 November, an Ethiopian government official acknowledged {{for the first time}} that Ethiopian troops had entered Somali territory for reconnoitring duties. After the IGAD meeting held the same day in Ethiopia's capital, the government official, who requested anonymity, indicated that the Ethiopian government would deploy troops inside Somalia to assist the Somali and Kenyan forces' efforts. He added that the Ethiopian military's activities were for the moment limited to liaison work and reconnaissance, but that [...] "We are looking at a brief period of time, weeks.

2500|$|In {{a speech}} {{on the subject of}} confederation, made in 1866 to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, John A. Macdonald said of the planned governor: [...] "We place no {{restriction}} on Her Majesty's prerogative in the selection of her representative... The sovereign has unrestricted freedom of choice... We <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> Her Majesty in all confidence." [...] However, between 1867 and 1931, governors general were appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British Cabinet. Thereafter, in accordance with the Statute of Westminster 1931, the appointment was made by the sovereign with the direction of his or her Canadian ministers only. Until 1952, all governors general were also either members of the Peerage or sons of peers, and were born beyond Canada's borders. These viceroys spent a relatively limited time in Canada, but their travel schedules were so extensive that they could [...] "learn more about Canada in five years than many Canadians in a lifetime." [...] Still, though all Canadian nationals were as equally British subjects as their British counterparts prior to the implementation of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947, the idea of Canadian-born persons being appointed governor general was raised as early as 1919, when, at the Paris Peace Conference, Canadian prime minister Robert Borden consulted with Prime Minister of South Africa Louis Botha and the two agreed that the viceregal appointees should be long-term residents of their respective Dominions. Calls for just such an individual to be made viceroy came again in the late 1930s, {{but it was not until}} Vincent Massey's appointment by King George VI in 1952 that the position was filled by a Canadian-born individual. Massey stated of this that [...] "a Canadian [...] makes it far easier to look on the Crown as our own and on the Sovereign as Queen of Canada." [...] This practice continued until 1999, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative Adrienne Clarkson, a Hong Kong-born refugee to Canada. Moreover, the practice of alternating between anglophone and francophone Canadians was instituted with the appointment of Georges Vanier, a francophone who succeeded the anglophone Massey. All persons whose names are put forward to the [...] for approval must first undergo background checks by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.|$|E
