5000|$|For aircraft, <b>loading</b> {{is divided}} into two major categories: limit <b>loads</b> and {{ultimate}} <b>loads.</b> Limit <b>loads</b> are the maximum <b>loads</b> a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate <b>loads</b> are the limit <b>loads</b> times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust <b>loads</b> are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash <b>loads</b> are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground [...] Other <b>loads</b> that may be critical are pressure <b>loads</b> (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground <b>loads.</b> <b>Loads</b> on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic <b>loading.</b> These cyclic <b>loads</b> can cause metal fatigue.|$|R

5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being <b>loaded</b> onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were <b>loaded</b> quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be <b>loaded</b> in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E

5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be <b>loaded</b> {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be <b>loaded</b> the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E

40|$|A Day of Launch flight <b>loads</b> {{assessment}} {{technique that}} determines running <b>loads</b> calculated from flexible body coupled <b>loads</b> {{was developed for}} the Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle. The technique was developed to quantify DOL flight <b>loads</b> in terms of structural <b>load</b> components rather than the typically used q-alpha metric to provide more insight into the DOL <b>loads.</b> In this technique, running <b>loads</b> in the primary structure are determined from the combination of quasi-static aerodynamic <b>loads</b> and dynamic <b>loads.</b> The aerodynamic <b>loads</b> are calculated {{as a function of}} time using trajectory parameters passed from the DOL trajectory simulation and are combined with precalculated dynamic <b>loads</b> using a <b>load</b> combination equation. The potential change in aerodynamic <b>load</b> due to wind variability during the countdown is included in the <b>load</b> combination. In the event of a <b>load</b> limit exceedance, the technique allows the identification of what <b>load</b> component is exceeded, a quantification of how much the <b>load</b> limit is exceeded, and where on the vehicle the exceedance occurs. This technique was used to clear the Ares I-X FTV for launch on October 28, 2009.
