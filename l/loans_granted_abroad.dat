Methodology: We used a qualitative and deductive scientific method. The empirical material and data has been collected through four face-to-face interviews with three major banks operating in Umeå. Conclusions: We found that financial and accounting information is significant during credit assessment for SMEs, {{especially when it comes}} to evaluate their repayment ability and control of their financial stability. Still, there are other factors that play a major roll and have therefore to be taken into consideration such as acquaintance and what the loan is going to be used for.
