5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer {{population of the}} Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, {{have been forced to}} take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> {{been done}} on this species, and not much is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is {{primarily}} frugivorous, although it does occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and letting the sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

25|$|The Australian National Household Survey of 2001 {{showed that}} {{cannabis}} in Australia is rarely used without other drugs. 95% of cannabis users also drank alcohol; 26% took amphetamines; 19% took ecstasy and only 2.7% reported not having used any other drug with cannabis. While {{research has been}} undertaken on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis on performing certain tasks, <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been conducted on the reasons why this combination is so popular. Evidence from a controlled experimental study undertaken by Lukas and Orozco suggests that alcohol causes THC to be absorbed more rapidly into the blood plasma of the user.

25|$|The {{level of}} intertribal warfare amongst pre-European Māori is unknown. Oral histories, legends and whakapapa include many stories of battles and wars but <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> {{been carried out}} into how often wars {{actually}} happened. In Making Peoples James Belich argues that they were probably uncommon in the few centuries immediately after the arrival of Māori in New Zealand in about 1280 CE, as there was ample land and resources to go around. Archaeological evidence suggests that following population growth and the extinction of the moa (a large flightless bird), warfare increased as tribes and hapū (subtribes) competed over scarce resources. At some point, perhaps before this cultural change, one group migrated to the Chatham Islands, where they developed the largely pacifist Moriori culture. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland Māori in the 1830s.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesia {{of exotic}} animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, birds) is {{challenging}} {{and the higher}} peri-anesthetic mortality in these species compared to dogs and cats, attests to this fact. These animals are challenging to anesthetize {{for a number of}} reasons: very <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been carried out on safe and effective drug doses for specific species; exotic pets often 'hide' {{the fact that they are}} sick and by the time owners realize how sick the pet is the course of the disease is far advanced; the unique anatomy and physiology of exotic pets poses challenges for anesthetic management. For example, the anatomy of the respiratory system of birds, Guinea pigs, and reptiles makes it difficult to induce and maintain anesthesia solely with inhalation agents such as isoflurane and sevoflurane. Injectable drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers are often used in these patients to facilitate induction and maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E

25|$|In this sampradaya, the {{significance}} of Radha {{is not less than}} {{the significance}} of Sri Krsna. Both are conjointly the object to be worshiped in this school of Nimbarka, who {{is also one of the}} first commentators on Brahma Sutras under the name Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha. The later acharyas of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in the 13th and 14th centuries in Vrindavana composed much literature on the Divine Couple. Swami Sri Sribhatta, the elder god-brother of Jayadeva composed the Yugala Shataka for the Dhrupada style of musical presentation like Jayadeva, however unlike Jayadeva who composed his work in Sanskrit, Swami Shribhatta's compositions are in Vraja Bhasha, a Hindi vernacular which was understood by all inhabitants of Vraja. Indeed, the rest of the acharyas of this tradition wrote in Vraja Bhasha and due to the lack of prevalence of this language in modern times, very <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done, even though these Acharyas predate the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan by centuries.|$|E
25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E
25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region that they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which <b>little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus.

25|$|In 1927, {{scientists}} {{isolated the}} {{yellow fever virus}} in West Africa. Following this, two vaccines were developed in the 1930s. The vaccine 17D {{was developed by the}} South African microbiologist Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the work of Ernest Goodpasture, Theiler used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a Nobel Prize in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue. Since this vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of encephalitis, FNV was not recommended after 1961. Vaccine 17D is still in use, and more than 400 million doses have been distributed. <b>Little</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done to develop new vaccines.

500|$|MTBI has a {{mortality}} rate of almost zero. The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks, but problems may persist. These are seldom permanent, and outcome is usually excellent. The overall prognosis for recovery {{may be influenced}} by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury, intellectual abilities, family environment, social support system, occupational status, coping strategies, and financial circumstances. People over age55 may take longer to heal from MTBI or may heal incompletely. Similarly, factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting post-concussion symptoms. [...] Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression, poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it, and life stress. Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms.
