40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{distributed}} matching of features in networks with vision systems. Every camera in the network has limited communication capabilities and can only exchange <b>local</b> <b>matches</b> with its neighbors. We propose a distributed algorithm that takes these <b>local</b> <b>matches</b> and computes global correspondences by a proper propagation in the network. When the algorithm finishes, each camera knows the global correspondences between its features and the features of all the cameras in the network. The presence of spurious introduced by the local matcher may produce inconsistent global correspondences, which are association paths between features from the same camera. The contributions of this work are the propagation of the <b>local</b> <b>matches</b> and the detection and resolution of these inconsistencies by deleting <b>local</b> <b>matches.</b> Our resolution algorithm considers the quality of each <b>local</b> <b>match,</b> when this information is provided by the local matcher. We formally prove that after executing the algorithm, the network finishes with a global data association free of inconsistencies. We provide a fully decentralized solution to the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology. Simulations and experimental results with real images show the performance of the method considering different features, matching functions and scenarios. Comment: This paper has been withdraw...|$|R

A novel method to compare keygraphs was proposed in order to exploit their local struc-tural information, producing better <b>local</b> <b>matches.</b> This speeds up an object matching pipeline, particularly using RANSAC, because each key-graph match contains enough information to produce a pose hypothesis, significantly {{reducing the number of}} <b>local</b> <b>matches</b> required for object matching and pose estimation.

40|$|Local {{structure}} prediction {{can facilitate}} ab initio structure prediction, protein threading, and remote homology detection. However, {{the accuracy of}} existing methods is limited. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based prediction method that assigns a measure called the <b>local</b> <b>match</b> rate to each position of an amino acid sequence to estimate the confidence of our method. Empirically, {{the accuracy of the}} method correlates positively with the <b>local</b> <b>match</b> rate; therefore, we employ it to predict the local structures of positions with a high <b>local</b> <b>match</b> rate. For positions with a low <b>local</b> <b>match</b> rate, we propose a neural network prediction method. To better utilize the knowledge-based and neural network methods, we design a hybrid prediction method, HYPLOSP (HYbrid method to Protein LOcal Structure Prediction) that combines both methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we first perform cross-validation experiments by applying our knowledge-based method, a neural network method, and HYPLOSP to a large dataset of 3, 925 protein chains. We test our methods extensively on three different structural alphabets and evaluate their performance by two widely used criteria, MDA (Maximum Deviation of backbone torsion Angle) and QN, which is similar to Q 3 in secondary structure prediction. We then compare HYPLOSP with three previous studies using a dataset of 56 new protein chains. HYPLOSP shows promising results in terms of MDA and QN accuracy and demonstrates its alphabet-independent capability...|$|R
