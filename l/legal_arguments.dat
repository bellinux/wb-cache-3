5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the <b>legal</b> <b>arguments</b> for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E

5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the <b>legal</b> <b>arguments,</b> but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had almost universally recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the German Reichstag {{developed}} a plan {{by which the}} river in Duala would be moved inland to allow for wholly European riverside settlements. Manga Bell became the leader of pan-Duala resistance to the policy. He and the other chiefs at first pressured the administration through letters, petitions, and <b>legal</b> <b>arguments,</b> but these were ignored or rebutted. Manga Bell turned to other European governments for aid, and he sent representatives to the leaders of other Cameroonian peoples to suggest {{the overthrow of the}} German regime. Sultan Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum people reported his actions to the authorities, and the Duala leader was arrested. After a summary trial, Manga Bell was hanged for high treason on 8 August 1914. His actions made him a martyr in Cameroonian eyes. Writers such as Mark W. DeLancey, Mark Dike DeLancey, and Helmuth Stoecker view his actions as an early example of Cameroonian nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Southwest Africa has a {{rich history}} {{encompassing}} colonisation, war and genocide. The first European {{to set foot}} on Namibian soil was the Portuguese explorer Diogo CÃ£o in 1485. Over the next 500 years, the country was colonised by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a German colony (German South-West Africa) from 1884 until its annexation by South Africa during World War I. After the war, it was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations. After World War II the United Nations (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under UN trusteeship, but South Africa refused. <b>Legal</b> <b>arguments</b> continued until 1966 when the UN General Assembly resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.|$|E

5|$|De Montfort's {{coalition}} {{began to}} quickly fragment, Henry regained his {{freedom of movement}} and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's <b>legal</b> <b>arguments</b> held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of <b>legal</b> <b>arguments</b> about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their <b>legal</b> <b>arguments.</b> Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of <b>legal</b> <b>arguments,</b> including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the second}} time I have had the {{pleasure}} of honoring Mark Tushnet 2 Ì 7 s life and work. In this Essay, as in the previous one I wrote with Sandy Levinson, I will focus on a theme that is central to both Tushnet 2 Ì 7 s work and mine. I call it constitutional historicism, the idea that the conventions that determine what makes an argument about the Constitution good or bad, what legal claims are plausible, and which are 2 Ì 2 off the wall, 2 Ì 2 change over time in response to changing political, social, and historical conditions. Historicists assume that legal materials and the internal conventions of <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> are not infinitely malleable and, at any point in time, are genuinely constraining on practitioners of <b>legal</b> <b>argument.</b> Nevertheless, they are sufficiently flexible to allow law to become an important site for political and social struggle. Indeed, these legal materials and conventions of <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> are themselves gradually changing in response to the political and social struggles that are waged through them. As a result, the internal norms of good <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> are a moving target; they are constantly in the process of changing in response to political, social, and historical forces in ways that norms of legal reasoning do not always directly acknowledge...|$|R
40|$|Argumentation {{is a key}} {{activity}} of lawyers. Therefore in law school teaching argumentation is essential. Information technology can provide useful support in argumentation courses. New opportunities come from a recent topic {{of research in the}} field AI & Law, viz. computer-mediated <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> (e. g., Gordon, Lodder, Loui). The starting point for the research on computer- mediated <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> is that a computer system can support lawyers by mediating the process in which they draft and generate arguments: the system can administer and supervise the argument process by keeping track of the reasons adduced and the conclusions drawn, and by checking whether the users of the system obey the pertaining rules of argument, e. g., those related to the division of burden of proof. Computer-mediated <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> poses a new problem: how should an argument be presented to the users of the mediating system? Especially with regards to recently developed logical tools (e. g., Hage, Prakken, Sartor, Verheij), there is little experience with argument presentation. There is a natural division of approaches to argument presentation in two classes: the verbal and the visual approaches. In the verbal approach, the argument is mainly presented in a verbal style, for instance {{in the form of a}} text or a written-out dialog. In the visual approach, the argument is mainly presented in a visual style, for instance in the form of a tree of sentences. In the paper, we reconstruct elements of a Dutch Supreme Court case on tort law (March 20, 1992) and its sequel at the Court of Justice of The Hague (September 15, 1994) in two prototypical systems for the mediation of <b>legal</b> <b>argument.</b> The first system takes the verbal approach; the second system takes the visual approach. We discuss the opportunities of the two approaches for teaching <b>legal</b> <b>argument.</b> Our conclusion is that neither approach is fully satisfactory for teaching <b>legal</b> <b>argument</b> if it is taken to its extreme, but that a hybrid combination of verbal and visual elements should be striven for.
