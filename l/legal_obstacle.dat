25|$|The Hoboken Land and Improvement Company {{operated}} a ferry across the Hudson River between Hoboken and New York City. Until early 1859 the NJRR paid the HL {{for the business}} that instead used the NJRR ferry. Because of this, the HL decided to help the M by building their new alignment, using the New York and Erie Railroad's Long Dock Tunnel. To use the Erie's tunnel a supplement to their charter was needed; this was passed March 8, 1860 after arguments against the bill from the NJRR. Another <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle</b> was the NJRR's monopoly over bridges, granted to the Passaic and Hackensack Bridge Company, invalidated by the state in 1861. The first excursion train operated on the new alignment on November 14, 1862, but a contract required the M to continue using the NJRR until October 13, 1863. The next day, regular service began via the new alignment.|$|E
500|$|Four companies—the American Bridge Company, McClintic-Marshall Company, Phoenix Bridge Company, and Taylor-Fichter Steel Construction Company—were awarded {{contracts}} {{for the so-called}} [...] "Diagonal Highway", with construction to start in April 1930. The two river bridges, McClintic-Marshall's portion, were completed first, and the $21million road was opened at 8:00a.m. on November 24, 1932, after an official ceremony the previous day on the Kearny ramp. Owing to the Great Depression and problems with funding, Governor A. Harry Moore directed the Highway Commission on October 25, 1932 to make a formal request to the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads to charge tolls on the Diagonal Highway. It was thought that tolls would be illegal because {{of the use of}} $600,000 of federal aid to build the road, but that {{it might be possible to}} transfer this funding to other projects. A bill was introduced into the state legislature on May 1, 1933, to add tolls to the road (then known as the [...] "sky way"), at a rate of 10cents for cars and 20cents for trucks. The <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle</b> to federal aid was resolved by gaining approval to transfer the funds.|$|E

2500|$|Footage from a Soviet {{documentary}} about the bomb is featured in Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie (Visual Concept Entertainment, 1995), where it {{is referred to as}} the Russian monster bomb. The video states that the Tsar Bomba project broke the voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests. In fact, Soviets restarted their tests and broke the unilateral voluntary moratorium three months before Tsar Bomba, and since the moratorium was unilateral there was no multilateral <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle.</b> (Earlier, the U.S. had also declared a one-year unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests, and as that year had expired, the US had already announced that it considered itself free to resume testing without further notice but had not resumed testing at the time of the Tsar Bomba test.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} in the U.S., the granting, regulation, and {{rescission}} of corporate charters were managed by the legislative rather than executive branch in most states. [...] So adding to the allowed pursuits of the Reading by amending its charter was not a matter of simply a board decision and filing of papers. [...] This <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle</b> to increasing the Reading's control over coal production Gowen sneaked around in 1871 by eking out, through political allies, the Pennsylvania legislature's chartering a new corporation, the Laurel Run Improvement Company, whose vaguely set-out purpose was to be involved in coal and iron, and whose shares could be purchased by [...] "any railroad or mining company". This new company was quickly bought outright by the Reading as a subsidiary and renamed the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company (the Coal & Iron Co). In the meantime, Gowen obtained passage through the legislature of another bill permitting the Reading Railroad to borrow an unlimited amount of money. Gowen quickly arranged for a US$25 million bond issue and sent agents to buy up Schuylkill County coal land for the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} almost {{wondered}} why he should not of his own accord have decided upon some such course as this to settle that long-standing account of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. What {{was the use of}} this great skill in fence that he had come to acquire, unless he could turn it to account to avenge Vilmorin, and to make Aline safe from the lure of her own ambition? It would be an easy thing to seek out La Tour d'Azyr, put a mortal affront upon him, and thus bring him to the point. To-day this would be murder, murder as treacherous as that which La Tour d'Azyr had done upon Philippe de Vilmorin; for to-day the old positions were reversed, and it was Andre-Louis who might go to such an assignation without a doubt of the issue. It was a moral obstacle of which he made short work. But there remained the <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle</b> he had expounded to Danton. There was still a law in France; the same law which he had found it impossible to move against La Tour d'Azyr, but which would move briskly enough against himself in like case. And then, suddenly, as if by inspiration, he saw the way--a way which if adopted would probably bring La Tour d'Azyr to a poetic justice, bring him, insolent, confident, to thrust himself upon Andre-Louis' sword, with all the odium of provocation on his own side.|$|E

60|$|One point more. It is the {{question}} of an Indian member on the Viceroy's Executive Council. The absence of an Indian member from the Viceroy's Executive Council can no longer, I think, be defended. There is no <b>legal</b> <b>obstacle</b> or statutory exclusion. The Secretary of State can, to-morrow, if he likes, if there be a vacancy on the Viceroy's Council, recommend His Majesty to appoint an Indian member. All I want to say is that, if, during my tenure of office, there should be a vacancy on the Viceroy's Executive Council, I should feel it a duty to tender my advice to the King that an Indian member should be appointed. If it were on my own authority only, I might hesitate to take that step, because I am not very fond of innovations in dark and obscure ground, but here I have the absolute and the zealous approval and concurrence of Lord Minto himself. It was at Lord Minto's special instigation that I began to think seriously of this step. Anyhow, this is how it stands, that you have at this moment a Secretary of State and a Viceroy who both concur in such a recommendation. I suppose--if I may be allowed to give a personal turn to these matters--that Lord Minto and I have had as different experience of life and the world as possible, and we belong I daresay to different schools of national politics, because Lord Minto was appointed by the party opposite. It is a rather remarkable thing that two men, differing in this way in political antecedents, should agree in this proposal. We need not discuss what particular portfolio should be assigned to an Indian member. That will be settled by the Viceroy on the merits of the individual. The great object, the main object, is that the merits of individuals are to be considered and to be decisive, irrespective and independent of race and colour.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the failure}} of {{diplomatic}} efforts to protect endangered American lives, rights and economic interests in China, America considered commercial retaliation against Japan. by Japanese authorities or Japanese-sponsored agents in China. The American government felt that its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan was not affording an appropriate level of protection to U.S. commerce in areas within or occupied by Japan. Simultaneously, Japan's position under the treaty as a most favoured nation legally prevented the adoption of retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce.
