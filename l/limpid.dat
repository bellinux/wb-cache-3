The records also display a lively singing personality {{as well as a}} surprisingly strong chest voice and a mellow timbre. Her trill remains wonderfully fluent and accurate and her diction is excellent. Overall her discs have a charm and musicality that give us a hint of why, at her peak, she commanded $5,000 a night.|$|E
25|$|Preparatory {{to writing}} Pharaoh, Prus {{immersed}} himself in ancient Egyptian history, geography, customs, religion, art and writings. In the course of telling his story of power, personality, and the fates of nations, he produced a compelling literary depiction of life {{at every level of}} ancient Egyptian society. Further, he offers a vision of mankind as rich as Shakespeare's, ranging from the sublime to the quotidian, from the tragic to the comic. The book is written in <b>limpid</b> prose and is imbued with poetry, leavened with humor, graced with moments of transcendent beauty.|$|E
500|$|The article {{condemned}} Lady Macbeth as formalist, [...] "coarse, {{primitive and}} vulgar". Consequently, commissions {{began to fall}} off, and his income fell by about three-quarters. Even Soviet music critics who had praised the opera were forced to recant in print, saying they [...] "failed to detect the shortcomings of Lady Macbeth as pointed out by Pravda". Shortly after the [...] "Muddle Instead of Music" [...] article, Pravda published another, [...] "Ballet Falsehood", that criticized Shostakovich’s ballet The <b>Limpid</b> Stream. Shostakovich did not expect this second article because {{the general public and}} press already accepted this music as [...] "democratic"– that is, tuneful and accessible. However, Pravda criticized The <b>Limpid</b> Stream for incorrectly displaying peasant life on the collective farm.|$|E
500|$|Bede is {{described}} by Michael Lapidge as [...] "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read. In the words of Charles Plummer, {{one of the best-known}} editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede's Latin is [...] "clear and <b>limpid...</b> it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Homburg, Eden {{was associated with the}} mid-1930s fashion for wearing a white linen waistcoat with a lounge suit, while the poet and novelist Robert Graves likened Eden's moustache to those of film stars Ronald Colman, William Powell and Clark Gable: [...] "the new moustache was small, short and carefully cut, sometimes slightly curved over the lip at either end, sometimes making a thin straight line". When Eden visited New York City in 1938 he was [...] "deluged with fan mail from teenage college girls to elderly matrons", while women reporters and society editors [...] "gushed about his classic features, his long dark eyelashes, his <b>limpid</b> eyes, his clear skin, his wavy hair, his charm and magnetism". In another American city, a display of Homburgs in a shop window was adorned with the sign [...] "Welcome to Anthony Eden". In Amsterdam the hat became known as the [...] "Lord Eden".|$|E

John Dingwall from Daily Record gave the song full-five star rating, describing it as a [...] "funky pop grower which beats {{many of the}} American acts at their own game". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote it [...] "thrills with its edge electro bass", and that the Sugababes [...] "come over all seductive with the most transparently obvious lyrical euphemisms heard in a long time." [...] A journalist from Contactmusic.com regarded it as [...] "smart, sexy and danceable, packed with hooks and undeniably fun." [...] They described the verses as [...] "low-slung" [...] and the chorus as an [...] "un-second guessable blast of pure pop". However, Cameron Adamns of the Herald Sun criticized [...] "Easy" [...] as having [...] "none of the charm or sass" [...] of the other songs on Overloaded. Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media had a similar response to the song, writing that it attempts to [...] "reverse engineer the brand of cool that is commonly given to them via a <b>limpid</b> and largely tuneless rock-pop hybrid". Adam Webb of Yahoo! Music regarded the song as [...] "forgettable".|$|E
500|$|After the war, Beach Thomas {{stayed in}} Germany until 1919 and {{returned}} there in 1923 {{at the time}} of the Occupation of the Ruhr. He also undertook a tour of the world for the Daily Mail and The Times in 1922. His main focus, however, returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for The Observer from 1923 to 1956. Beach Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to The Spectator for almost 30 years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when H. E. Bates took responsibility. In 1928 he produced a history of the magazine under the title of The Story of the 'Spectator, in commemoration of its centenary. He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: A Traveller in News (1925) and The Way of a Countryman (1944). Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing, his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in The Observer said [...] "perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more <b>limpid</b> English been conveyed in a script more obscure." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{physicians}} {{could not}} agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered [...] "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, [...] "you have destroyed him and you may finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July [...] "in great sighings and dejections of spirits... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." [...] Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was [...] "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided {{the cause of death}} was [...] "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: [...] "four and a half ounces of a <b>limpid</b> humour were taken out." [...] A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, the Yamhill {{river was}} {{described}} as “a <b>limpid</b> stream of shallows and deeps in Summer, a brawling torrent in Winter.” [...] In 1874, the Yamhill was examined by the engineering department of the U.S. army, which found that the river would vary from a shallow chain of pools in the summer to a “river of great power and strength” whose waterlines along the banks showed a rise, sometimes, of over [...] during winter and spring floods.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{described}} Fisher's work as [...] "a graceful, <b>limpid</b> style", [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "sylvan romances". Others {{described it}} as being striking in its naturalness and truthfulness.

Yet, her work stands apart from the many narratives of travel in Appalachia in its honest and realistic portrait of life in southern society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pharaoh, as a [...] "political novel", has {{remained}} perennially topical ever {{since it was}} written. The book's enduring popularity, however, has {{as much to do}} with a critical yet sympathetic view of human nature and the human condition.

The book is written in <b>limpid</b> prose, imbued with poetry, leavened with humor, graced with moments of transcendent beauty.|$|E
2500|$|The Waley Genji (1921–1933) — Waley's Genji is {{considered}} a great achievement for his time, although some purists have criticized Waley's changes to the original. Others have criticized as overly-free {{the manner in which}} Waley translated the original text. Regardless, it continues to be well-appreciated and widely read today. When the Waley Genji was first published, it was eagerly received. [...] For example, Time explained that [...] "the reviewers' floundering tributes indicate something of its variegated appeal. In <b>limpid</b> prose The Tale combines curiously modern social satire with great charm of narrative. Translator Waley has done service to literature in salvaging to the Occident this masterpiece of the Orient." ...|$|E

Tadolini sings to perfection; and I would like the Lady not to sing.

Although this last article was technically an editorial attacking Shostakovich for [...] "formalism", it appeared in the [...] "Press Review" [...] section. Stalin, under cover of the Central Committee may have singled out Shostakovich because the plot and music of Lady Macbeth infuriated him, the opera contradicted Stalin's intended social and cultural direction for the nation at that period, he resented the recognition Shostakovich was receiving both in the Soviet Union and in the West.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Téchiné had {{his greatest}} success to date with Wild Reeds (Les roseaux sauvages) (1994). The film {{was commissioned by}} French television as one of {{part of a series}} of eight films entitled Tous les garçons et les filles de leur âge, although it was shown first at cinemas. This is a bucolic tale of teenage self-discovery centered on the inner turmoil of four teenagers staying at a boarding school in Aquitaine in 1962, their political and sexual awakening with the effect of the Algerian War as backdrop. The director, inspired by his own adolescence, delivers a <b>limpid</b> and sensual work, bathed by the light of southwest France. Téchiné works with certain sets of themes including family bonds, homosexuality, and exile. Wild Reeds is his most autobiographical movie; like the teen-age Téchiné, the main character, François, attends an all-male boarding school. While part of the story revolves around François's discovery that he is gay, Téchiné said his principal interest was to evoke how the Algerian war of independence was felt in a rural corner of France."If I hadn't been able to inject this, if I had only been making a film about adolescent coming of age, it wouldn't have interested me at all," [...] he explained.|$|E
2500|$|The Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, {{published}} one of {{the first}} English-language reviews of The Alchemist in 1993, saying, [...] "of books that I can recommend with the unshakable confidence of having read them and been entranced, impressed, entertained or moved, the universal gift is perhaps a <b>limpid</b> little fable called The Alchemist... In hauntingly spare prose, translated from the Brazilian original in Portuguese, it follows a young Andalusian shepherd into the desert on his quest for a dream and the fulfillment of his destiny." [...] Since then, the novel has received much praise, making it to the top spot on best-seller lists in 74 countries and winning prestigious awards in Germany and Italy. It has been called a [...] "charming story", [...] "a brilliant, simple narrative" [...] and [...] "a wonderful tale, a metaphor of life", from people in places as diverse as South Africa, Finland and Turkey. It has been praised by public figures like Will Smith and Jorge Garcia. Arash Hejazi, the Iranian publisher of Paulo Coelho, believes that The Alchemist is exceptional on several counts: he notes that the book has had a [...] "longer than expected life-cycle… It was not supported by high marketing budgets in the first few years after its publication. It was not written in French or Spanish. It did not enjoy a film tie-in and was not recommended by positive reviews and the media, but it is still selling, only relying on the word of mouth as its main marketing tool." ...|$|E
2500|$|The great {{turning point}} in Callas's career {{occurred}} in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas {{that she would be}} singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her [...] "I guarantee that you can.". Michael Scott's words, [...] "the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur". Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, [...] "We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When can we expect a new edition of La traviata with [...] Gino Bechi's Violetta?" [...] After the performance, one critic wrote, [...] "Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her <b>limpid,</b> beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras." [...] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, [...] "What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the enormity of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, {{who is one of the}} great coloratura sopranos of our time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Bartlett's book Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health was published. The book {{examines}} contemporary psychiatry's {{and clinical}} psychology's definition {{of mental health}} {{in terms of the}} baseline standard of psychological normality. Bartlett makes the case that this supposition has come to be accepted uncritically — even though that supposition is fundamental to current clinical theory and practice, and forms the core of the psychiatric classification system of the DSM (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), which has become today’s diagnostic authority. Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health questions and rejects this central assumption. Among the author's objections to this assumption is the reification by the DSM of syndromes (i.e., equating mere syndromes with real disease entities) despite the absence of an organic basis for the majority of alleged medical disorders. Bartlett seeks to offer a constructive revision of what we should accept as a standard for good mental health. A critical assessment by PsychCRITIQUES combined a review of both The Pathology of Man and Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health, evaluating the two books as follows: [...] "Pathology and Normality contain many altogether usefully reframed concepts. he semiotic analysis of nosologies offered in Chapter 2 of Normality [...] a most promising organizing conceptual framework, helpful in understanding the problems with DSM classifications. It could not be more relevant in our times.... I wish everyone would read Bartlett’s chapter in Normality on the abuses of peer review and editorial bias (Chapter 7) and adopt his proposed code of conduct for peer reviewers and editors (p. 172). And Bartlett’s treatment of relativism, the relativity of frameworks, and human evil in Pathology is absolutely <b>limpid</b> (Chapter 20). These and many other gems are scattered throughout the books. For this reason, and because the books present such an unusual stance that can provoke thoughtful consideration of the accepted truths in psychology, I highly recommend them.... Both books are well written and clearly structured. Bartlett follows a regular expository pattern by explaining objectives, logically and systematically developing arguments and conclusions, and presenting frequent summaries. The premises and implications are intellectually easy to grasp, unforgettable, and alarming.... Bartlett includes considerations and concepts that are seldom presented elsewhere." ...|$|E
