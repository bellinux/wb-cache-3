In a proposal called Hill Railway, the British planned for a system of train stations across the Indian subcontinent.

40|$|We use large {{survey data}} sets of firms {{provided}} by the World Bank for China, India, and Brazil 2 ̆ 014 Investment Climate Surveys 2 ̆ 014 to address the important question: what determines the locational choice of firms among cities in these countries. We find that capital cities in all countries are attractive for firms to <b>locate.</b> <b>In</b> India and China, labour-intensive firms tend not to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> mid-sized or large cities, when compared with smaller ones, perhaps due to higher wage, training and attrition costs. Labour regulations both in India and China deter firms from <b>locating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> larger cities, but not in Brazil. Exporter firms prefer to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> large cities in these two countries, but not so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> largest cities of Brazil. Finally, while {{the size of a}} firm has no impact on its location decision in China, large firms in India prefer to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> largest cities, but not in mid-sized cities. Proximity to inputs within the city has a positive impact on firm location. <b>The</b> post-reform firms <b>in</b> China tend to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> large cities whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of India, post- 1991 firms refrain from <b>locating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-sized or large cities.
