40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} achieve the setting and {{hardening}} of mine shaft lining concrete under the minus temperature in freezing construction and {{to meet the demands}} of every performance of concrete, the technique of compounding air entraining admixture <b>and</b> <b>antifreezing</b> admixture <b>and</b> early strength water reducing admixture was applied in this research. Based on the orthogonal experimental design, several mix proportions of compound admixture for early strength liquid mine shaft lining concrete were developed in the laboratory. The data collected in this research provide reference for the optimum mix proportion of the adulteration quantity of the concrete admixture. The results show that the 2. 1 ％ amount of compound antifreezing admixture achieves favorable effects of liquid, early strength, freezing prevention <b>and</b> <b>antifreezing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} a numerical {{model for the}} analysis of elastohydrodynamic lubrication under conditions in which the nominal lubricant film thickness is small compared to the roughness present on the surfaces (lambda ratio less than unity). These conditions occur in most types of gear tooth contacts and in many other heavily loaded machine elements. In these situations, lubrication occurs at the roughness asperity level (micro-elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication),</b> <b>and</b> in extreme cases ‘mixed’ lubrication behaviour occurs in which momentary solid contacts between the surfaces take place. In both micro-elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>lubrication</b> regimes high, localised pressures are applied cyclically to asperity features as they move through the nominal contact leading to fatigue at the asperity level, which culminates in micropitting wear. Results of the modelling show the effect of lambda ratio in lubricated gear tooth contacts, and demonstrate the transition from full-film to micro-elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>lubrication,</b> <b>and</b> the consequences in terms of predicted fatigue damage...|$|R

We study these two mechanisms for activity of winter flounder antifreeze peptide.

Our {{results show that the}} short-range model is sufficient to explain the activity of our mutants, but the long-range model provides a necessary condition for activity: the most active peptides in our data set all have an extended dynamical hydration shell. It appears that <b>antifreeze</b> proteins <b>and</b> <b>antifreeze</b> glycoproteins have reached different evolutionary solutions to the antifreeze problem, utilizing either a few precisely positioned OH groups or a large quantity of OH groups for ice binding, assisted by long-range solvent perturbation...|$|R
