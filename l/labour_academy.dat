5000|$|In 1921 she was {{a member}} of a group of young socialist from Breslau who took part in the SPD party conference at Görlitz: here she felt {{naturally}} drawn to the left-wing of the party, opposing the possibility that the SPD might enter into coalition with the liberal-centrist People's Party. [...] In the meanwhile, she embarked on a training for work in a bank which she pursued as a career, first in Breslau and later in Cologne. However, she increasingly placed her political interests ahead of her career, and by 1924 she found herself unemployed. She spent a year attending lectures at the <b>Labour</b> <b>Academy</b> in Frankfurt as a [...] "free listener", while supporting herself by working in a perfume factory. Those whose lectures she attended included the labour lawyer Hugo Sinzheimer and his then assistant, Ernst Fraenkel. After attending lectures for a year at the <b>Labour</b> <b>Academy,</b> in 1925 she volunteered to work for the SPD party executive, which was embarking on a recruitment drive in a search for party officers and journalists of the future. This involved moving to Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Free {{schools are}} new state-funded but privately-run schools set {{up under the}} academies legislation. Free schools {{represent}} the most overtly market-oriented policy within the Conservative-led Coalition government's school reform programme in England and have provoked intense controversy, centring on issues of pupil attainment, social equality, democracy and privatisation. This paper evaluates the evidence {{for the performance of}} the models on which the policy is based: charter schools in the US, free schools in Sweden, and <b>Labour's</b> <b>academies.</b> The potential impact on local schools is assessed. Issues of democratic accountability are discussed, in terms of the application process, the governance of free schools, and their impact on local authorities. Factors affecting the future trajectory of the free school initiative are discussed, including the opportunities for private companies to set up and run free schools for profit. The paper concludes by considering the challenge which free schools represent to their critics. © 2011 Copyright Educational Review...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{abolition}} of grant-maintained status, the only remaining schools directly funded by central government were the 15 City Technology Colleges.In 2000 the Labour government introduced {{a new kind of}} directly funded school, the City Academy, later renamed Academy. Following the 2010 General Election the Academies Act 2010 was enacted, vastly expanding possibilities for schools to become academies. It was described by journalist Mike Baker as [...] "not an extension of the <b>Labour</b> government's <b>academies,</b> but the recreation of the grant-maintained (GM) schools".|$|R
50|$|The GDST {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the independent-led arm of the <b>Labour</b> Government's <b>Academy</b> programme and converted two schools into the maintained sector, with The Belvedere School, Liverpool, in September 2007 and Birkenhead High School in September 2009. These schools lose their right to select pupils on the basis of academic ability, but retain some independence from the Government with the GDST maintaining a majority on the governing body. The Junior Department of The Belvedere School, which had been retained as an independent preparatory school by the GDST, as the renamed The Hamlets, was subsequently sold in 2010, renamed Belvedere Preparatory School and became co-educational.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{periodicals}} of Czech institutions of adult {{education in the}} first half of the 20 th century. It focuses on the analysis of one volume of the three institution periodicals. Specifically, the periodical called Česká osvěta and published by Masaryk's Educational Institute, a journal called Dělnická osvěta and published by the <b>Labour</b> <b>Academy</b> and the periodical called Osvěta venkova and published by institution called Free Pasant Study. The focus is on the volume of period 1929 - 1930. The main topics mentioned in the periodicals include theoretical reflections on adult education and awareness and concrete actions in this field in Czechoslovakia - the legal framework (educational laws), the annual reports of organizations, issues of cooperation at local and national level, an overview of offered activities. Periodicals also bring news, features and examples of similar activities abroad. In the fornamed periodicals there is also place devoted to outstanding personalities from politics, culture and education. The major topics also include librarianship, literature, theater, puppetry, film, or to a lesser extent, music. Magazines do not often keep away from political and ideological issues. Magazines present similar structure and topics. They differ mainly in emphasis placed on specific [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that links between social identity and economic outcomes can induce poverty among groups with low social status. This seems to be true in Nepal where Dalits, the group {{at the bottom of}} the caste system, is also the group with the highest poverty rates. The aim of this thesis is to investigate determinants of poverty dynamics in a distinct village in the Tarai region of Nepal, where around half the population belong to Dalit castes. The analysis uses quantitative data collected in a household survey done during a fieldwork to Nepal, conducted in cooperation with the Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) of Bergen and the National <b>Labour</b> <b>Academy</b> (NLA) of Kathmandu. OLS as well as the logit model is used to investigate possible determinants of occupational outcomes and educational investment. All calculations are done by STATA version 11. 2. A main finding of the thesis is that Dalit households are more probable to be stuck at low human capital levels over time: Illiteracy is more likely to persist over two household generations for Dalit than non-Dalit households. In the descriptive analysis, I furthermore find skilled wage labour in the modern sector of the economy to be a main pathway out of poverty for Dalits. Skilled workers are in turn found to be more likely to have education than lower-income unskilled workers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{survey the}} UK-based {{literature}} on school structures and school autonomy to identify settings in which alternative and more autonomous school arrangements {{can improve the}} educational attainments of pupils in the bottom tail of the achievement distribution. We also present new evidence {{on the effect of}} school academies on the age- 16 GCSE attainment of students of different abilities up to 2009, before the Coalition Government changed the nature of the <b>Labour</b> <b>academy</b> programme. Within the UK education system, academies enjoy substantial autonomy in terms of management of their staff, taught curriculum, length of the school day and other aspects of their day-to-day functioning. Our results show that schools that converted to academies between 2002 and 2007 improved their overall age- 16 GCSEs results by further raising the attainments of students in {{the top half of the}} ability distribution, and in particular pupils in the top 20 % tail. Conversely, we find little evidence that academies helped pupils in the bottom 10 % and 20 % of the ability distribution. Finally, we find little evidence that late converters (2008 and 2009) had any beneficial effects on pupils of any ability. We conclude our research by comparing the experience of UK academies to that of US charter schools and Swedish free schools, and by providing some insights into the reasons why UK academies did not serve ‘the tail ’ as is the case for some US charter schools...|$|E

50|$|In 2007, it was rumoured that Seed was {{in trouble}} with Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor; allegedly, the Cardinal was upset that Seed had {{introduced}} wealthy businessmen to government officials {{in an attempt to}} secure financing for <b>Labour's</b> flagship <b>academies.</b> Some speculated that Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor saw this move by Seed as unwarranted support of specific Labour policies. The Cardinal was also reported as being annoyed at Seed's statement that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, would become a Catholic upon leaving Downing Street. As noted above, Blair did indeed become a Catholic shortly after leaving office. However, Michael Seed only vacated his long standing position as Ecumenical Advisor on the retirement of Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor in 2009 when he was succeeded by Cardinal Vincent Nichols as the Archbishop of Westminster.|$|R

STMIK AMIKOM, said that:STMIK AMIKOM {{is a private}} university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. STMIK {{is a kind of}} 'academy' in the four-tier post-secondary system of universities, institutes, academies and polytechnics. STMIK stands for 'schools for technology, management, information and computers'. The academy concentrates on innovative technologies. It has an enrollment of more than 7,600 students, which compares strongly with nearby institutions that are closing because of a shortage of students. The academy produces graduates who are very popular in the <b>labour</b> market. The <b>academy</b> also runs several commercial enterprises: television channels, radio channels, cartoon production, software design, internet services, advertising, computer systems, consultancy and mobile networks. These commercial setups also provide valuable ground for student internships. The academy claims to produce 'graduates with global qualities, productive, entrepreneurial, professionals, especially in knowledge based on computer and informatics'.|$|R
