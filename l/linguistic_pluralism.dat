In other words, language education policies of the 21 st century need to grapple with the challenge that language communities are ‘local and global at the same time’ (Canagarajah, 2005 : 17).

Primary legal uncertainty gives rise to the need for judicial interpretation. Judges do not openly decide in accordance with political or personal preference; they are expected to justify their decision by reference to interpretative topoi or arguments, which fall into three main categories: linguistic, systemic and purposive, in addition to precedents. There is no overarching rule or formula governing the application of these topoi, e.g. which type of argument prevails in which circumstances. Judges, in consequence, enjoy considerable discretion in the application of the available topoi and over which topos should enjoy primacy in which sets of circumstances.|$|R

40|$|A linguistically and {{culturally}} diversified arts scene, {{which is coming}} {{to be recognized as}} a feature of contemporary Hong Kong, is something people rather take for granted in the city. It has emerged less from specific top-down policies by the government, as for example in Singapore, and more in accordance with Hong Kong’s time-honoured laissez faire approach to linguistic and cultural development. Since the city’s 1997 retrocession to China there has been the remarkable phenomenon of increased sinicization in education and culture (especially related to the exponentially developing status of Putonghua) going hand-in-hand with a somewhat less heralded renaissance in creative writing and performance in English, as well as an expansion in mixed-language and bilingual practices. This seeming paradox is, as my paper will elucidate, {{one of the most interesting}} aspects of Hong Kong’s often under-rated creative hybridity. In this paper, I will argue that the Hong Kong arts sector, without being entirely aware of it, is a rather good role model for linguistic and cultural diversity and pluralism. While the respective languages intersect with one another on occasions or run in parallel much of the time, the arts field by the very nature of its grass-roots pragmatism and participation, offers a useful example of linguistic and cultural co-existence that other communities may find worth emulating or at least exploring. Moreover, it is my contention that the arts community in Hong Kong, and by extension its audiences, far from being seduced by the global monoculture so pervasive in the field of commerce, is predicated on a healthy blend of localist and internationalist perspectives. In this respect there is a clear division between the globalist, consumerist and commercial profile maintained by the city’s business interests and the very different interests of its arts community. The paper explores the strengths of the Hong Kong arts environment and puts it forward as a good model of linguistic integration, diversity and pluralism, while acknowledging perceived flaws in official attitudes and arts policy in the city. I argue that bilingualism, biculturalism and, indeed, cultural pluralism are promoted in the city’s present cultural life. However, it is a sad fact that the positive aspects of this pluralism are often not fully recognized or officially proclaimed. Perhaps the reason for this reluctance to broadcast Hong Kong’s tremendous cultural developments of recent years may be attributed to the community’s traditional lack of interest in the arts. Perhaps also the very idea of <b>linguistic</b> and cultural <b>pluralism</b> tends to muddy the clear waters of governmental cultural policy vis-à-vis the linguistic-cultural expectations of the territory’s mainland masters and the global capitalist market...|$|R
40|$|Endangered {{languages}} create {{learning and}} social contexts {{that are different}} from learning dominant majority languages. As a field with {{its roots in the}} Anglo-American tradition there is huge scope for SLA to be more inclusive of language and social contexts where <b>linguistic</b> and cultural <b>pluralism</b> is a given, not a deviation. This thesis contributes to a wider understanding in the combination of theoretical and contextual diversity and linguistic heritage in endangered language acquisition (ELA). To explore this idea in context this study focuses on second language (L 2) learners and new speakers of Māori to provide a portrait of an under-acknowledged group and understand their role in the language’s future at a critical point in the vitality of te reo Māori. This poses question around the role of L 2 learners in endangered language revitalisation. How do L 2 learners locate themselves in the context of language revitalisation? What are L 2 learners’ perceptions of the community and the individual in the revitalisation of te reo Māori? What role does the Māori language have Māori life and has this changed over the last 40 years of the Māori language movement? What terminology do L 2 learners describe themselves? What factors of L 2 learning have helped language development the most? And finally, what have been some of the struggles of L 2 learning of Māori? As a study of Māori language speakers it is grounded methodologically in a framework that views and shapes all participants in Māori worlds, including the Pākehā researcher. In negotiating this space and drawing on the wisdom and experience of other Pākehā researchers, the thesis hopes to be part of an existing intellectual narrative around theoretical and practical aspects of Pākehā identity in and engagement with Māori worlds. This study draws on four decades of experience in Māori language revitalisation through its participants, who reveal Māori language learning as a site of multi-level hegemonic resistance, mediated access to the language and disruption to traditional roles. The study highlights the possible repercussions in restricting Māori language learning to ‘mainstream’ tertiary institutions as it becomes increasingly vulnerable to prevailing neoliberal policies and hegemonic practices. However, the most important and revelatory feature of the participants’ stories and the literature is that we can recast the earliest theoretical and philosophical endeavours of Māori language revitalisation in Kōhanga Reo and Te Ātaarangi as pivotal to its success. And equally, to celebrate Māori language communities’ extraordinary efforts since the 1970 s to contribute towards a more sophisticated understanding of the social conditions of eL 2 (L 2 learners of endangered languages) as they take their ancestral languages into the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|The main {{argument}} of my thesis {{is concerned with}} the representational and coding differences between abstract and concrete words and concepts. This difference will be analyzed from the viewpoints of distinct theories. In the literature, the fact that human beings process, understand and retrieve faster the concrete concepts in comparison with the abstract concepts is accepted by all accounts, either modal accounts or amodal accounts or hybrid accounts. However, these different approaches believe in distinct reasons for this difference. The first account is Context availability theory. According to this approach the reason for which the concrete words and concepts are in advantage from the representational point of view is that they have stronger contextual resources. This contextual information is originated from human internal contextual knowledge and external contextual information in our living environment. The second theoretical approach is Dual Coding Theory. DCT on the contrary of CAT does not believe that the availability of contextual information is the main reason of this difference. DCT claims that human beings possess two types of coding system to process the information. Because the information that they receive are divided into two kinds: non-verbal information and verbal information. The non-verbal information is the sensorimotor information that we receive from our living environment. The verbal information is the one that is obtained from the linguistic input stored in the memory. DCT claims that {{depending on the type of}} information that humans want to process they use different kind of representational system. Verbal one for verbal information and imaginal one for non verbal information. The next theory that will be explained in the context of representational differences between abstract and concrete words and concepts is Words as Social Tools or WAT model. In agreement with this model abstract words and concepts are not different from concrete ones from the embodiment point of view. This distinction is rooted in other aspects such as importance of linguistic contexts for abstract words, acquisition modality, activation of different neural networks, and meaning variability across languages. The last assumption refers to the fact that the representation of abstract words and concepts depends more on the cultural and <b>linguistic</b> environment. Representational <b>pluralism</b> is the next approach which attempts to explain the difference of coding and representation between concrete and abstract words and concepts. It claims that the concepts are represented neither completely by using sensorimotor information, nor due to the existence of an abstract computational mechanism. Therefore, the concepts that are represented in human cognitive system are grounded on both modal and amodal representations. In accordance witth this position, the explanations of modal theories could be sufficient for the acquisition of the concepts that are simulated and extracted from our human perceptual experiences, but not for the acquisition of the concepts that do not have direct referent in our living environment. On the contrary, the amodal accounts do not totally explain how concrete concepts could be acquired without using their sensorimotor information. Supramodality is the last account which tries to explain this indicated difference between concrete and abstract concepts. In accordance with this approach supramodality does explain the processing of both abstract and concrete concepts, and could be a soloution for all the observed gaps in other described accounts...|$|R

A focus on such a co-evolution is pertinent as the evolution of languages in the Internet environment can be better understood if the development of its existing and emerging content, that is, the content in the respective language, is taken into consideration. By doing so, this article examines two related aspects: the governance of languages at critical sites of the Internet environment, including ICANN, Wikipedia and Google Translate. Following on from this examination, the second part outlines how the co-evolution of languages and associated content in the Internet environment extends policy-making related to <b>linguistic</b> <b>pluralism.</b> It is argued that policies which centre on language availability in the Internet environment must shift their focus to the dynamics of available content instead. The notion of language pairs as a new regime of intersection for both languages and content is discussed to introduce an extended understanding of the uses of <b>linguistic</b> <b>pluralism</b> in the Internet environment. The ultimate extrapolation of such an enhanced approach, it is argued, centres less on 6, 000 languages but, instead, on 36 million language pairs.
