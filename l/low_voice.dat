5|$|Shōgo Suzuki/Steve Blum as Vincent Valentine. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent to have noticeably {{different}} voices {{because the}} characters were otherwise quite similar. Since Vincent was {{older and more}} mature than Cloud, his role was given to Suzuki, who has a very <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Вполголоса (Half-Whispered or In a <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> 1928) {{contained}} 38 {{poems and}} {{was dedicated to}} Tsuberbiller. Eighteen of the poems were written in 1926 and the other twenty were written the following year. The name, literally sotto voce, reflected the dark thoughts which had pervaded her life over the period, worries of isolation, madness, and death, sprinkled with a few rare lyrics of rapture and vigor.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{there are}} some unique {{features}} to La Rue's style. He had a liking for extreme <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> ranges, descending sometimes to C or even the subterranean B flat below the bass staff; he employed more chromaticism than most of his contemporaries; and much of his work is rich in dissonance. He also broke up long, dense textures by inserting contrasting passages for two voices only, something done also by Ockeghem and Josquin. He {{was one of the}} first routinely to expand vocal forces from the standard four, to five or six. One of his masses for six voices, the Missa Ave sanctissima Maria, is a six-voice canon, a technically difficult feat reminiscent of some of the work of Ockeghem. This is also the earliest six-voice mass known to exist.|$|E
6000|$|... "From within {{there came}} the muffled sound of <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> and quick steps, {{followed}} by a confused scuffling noise, then silence, then the <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Kurt heard <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> {{and soft}} footfalls. Some dark forms loomed up.|$|R
60|$|As {{the girls}} feasted {{they heard a}} {{crunching}} sound and inquired in <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> what it was.|$|R
500|$|Vincent's Japanese voice actor, Shōgo Suzuki, {{explained}} that he tries [...] "to hold back as much emotion as possible when playing Vincent," [...] noting that Vincent is [...] "a bit of a loner" [...] and [...] "appears cold on the surface." [...] Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent's voices to contrast with each other due to their similarities in terms of personality. He felt Vincent was older and more mature than Cloud, {{and as a result}} he cast Suzuki, who has a very <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked {{to her in a}} <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E
500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b> Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything that I could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E
60|$|Absolute silence {{followed}} that statement. Presently {{it was broken}} by a rattling of loose gravel and then <b>low</b> <b>voices.</b>|$|R
60|$|At dusk on {{the second}} evening, Beatrice and Harding walked across the prairie, {{speaking}} in <b>low</b> <b>voices,</b> anxious and yet serene.|$|R
60|$|Darkness came; {{the fire}} died down; the <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> of Durade and his men, and of callers who visited them, flowed continuously.|$|R
500|$|Both Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune {{felt that}} Morgan gave [...] "his {{best and most}} {{believable}} performance of the season" [...] in [...] "Devil's Trap", with the latter adding, [...] "He was really on fire in that scene, and it brought a whole new intensity to his performance." [...] Diana Steenbergen of IGN found him [...] "menacing, with his <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> and the cruel words... trying to tear them apart emotionally before tearing Dean apart literally", and enjoyed the sadistic and [...] "vicious humor" [...] that makes the character [...] "more sinister". However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't quite make sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season. [...] "If the firestarting demon is the Big Bad {{for the first two}} seasons, that's fine", he commented, [...] "but don't drag it out longer than that. Fans will get bored. And there's nothing scarier than that.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana often {{altered the}} song's lyrics and tempo for live {{performances}}. Some live {{performances of the}} song had the line [...] "our little group has always been" [...] changed to [...] "our little tribe has always been," [...] which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] " [...] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit." [...] A notable alternate performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, [...] "Load up on guns, bring your friends" [...] became [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). [...] Cobain later said {{he was trying to}} sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance {{can be found on the}} 1994 home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.|$|E
2500|$|... gehanta or [...] "inclinations": prayers said in <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> by the celebrant ...|$|E
60|$|The captains drew {{apart and}} began to talk in <b>low</b> <b>voices,</b> while Ayesha stood still, {{apparently}} quite unconcerned, and I considered the situation.|$|R
60|$|They all talked {{together}} {{for a time in}} <b>low</b> <b>voices.</b> The Professor was inclined to scout the theory of Craig having approached them.|$|R
60|$|Emily {{heard the}} door opened--heard <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> in the passage. There was a {{momentary}} interval. Then, Mrs. Ellmother returned. She said nothing. Emily spoke to her.|$|R
2500|$|Agnus Dei. [...] The ministers say the Agnus Dei at {{the altar}} in the <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> while the choir sings the Agnus Dei aloud.|$|E
2500|$|Secret. [...] After the celebrant {{finishes}} praying [...] "Suscipe sancta Trinitas..." [...] he {{says the}} secret prayers of the Mass in the <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] He concludes the secret aloud [...] "Per omnia secula seculorum. Amen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Baxter Townshend, Oxford don {{and author}} of the Tenderfoot series of books; {{brother-in-law}} of the W.M.B. depicted in Variation IV. This variation references R.B.T's presentation of an old man in some amateur theatricals ‒ the <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> flying off occasionally into [...] "soprano" [...] timbre.|$|E
50|$|One widely applauded {{and popular}} 1962 {{addition}} was the contrabass, the biggest horn and <b>lowest</b> <b>voice,</b> two octaves below the soprano, which partially {{rests on the}} shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The men at {{the other}} table were talking {{together}} in <b>low</b> <b>voices,</b> and, listening intently, Hector could hear a murmur of voices in the room behind him.|$|R
60|$|<b>Low</b> <b>voices</b> {{close at}} hand. His voice and hers. The {{appointment}} was {{a device to}} keep the brother away! There they were yonder, by the felled tree.|$|R
2500|$|The priest quietly says several prayers here, before {{receiving}} Communion. The {{first is}} {{said in a}} <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> while taking up the Host onto the paten. [...] The second of them, spoken {{three times in a}} slightly audible voice, while the priest holds the Host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right, is based on : [...] "Lord, I am not worthy...." [...] Then, after having reverently consumed the Host, he takes up the chalice while in a <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> reciting : [...] "What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord." [...] immediately adding : [...] "Praising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ablutions. [...] The celebrant cleans the chalice and {{his fingers}} with water and wine. [...] The subdeacon then takes then covers the chalice and paten with the chalice veil and carries them to the {{credence}} table. [...] After the ablutions, the celebrant goes to the Epistle side of the altar and reads the communion antiphon in the <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Blessing. [...] The celebrant {{places his}} joined {{hands on the}} altar and says in a <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> the prayer Placeat tibi, sancta Trinitas for himself and those for whom he has offered Mass. Then he kisses the altar and, turning towards the congregation, blesses them [...] "in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti", making over them {{the sign of the}} cross.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isbel, I'm sorry--there's no hope," [...] she said, <b>low</b> <b>voiced.</b> [...] "Y'u've {{not long}} to live. I cain't help y'u. God knows I'd do so if I could." ...|$|R
60|$|The cord wood snapped and crackled, {{the front}} of the stove got red, and sitting in a corner out of the draughts, they began to talk in <b>low</b> <b>voices.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sh! What was that? Stealthy footsteps! <b>Low</b> <b>voices!</b> We gasp, {{we close}} up together, and wait. A vague shape glides {{out of the}} dusk and confronts us. A voice speaks--demands money! ...|$|R
2500|$|Sanctus. [...] Following the preface, {{the ministers}} recite {{the full text}} of the Sanctus in a <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> and the choir begins to sing it. While the celebrating priest then quietly says the Canon of the Mass, the choir {{continues}} its singing of the Sanctus, pausing before the part that begins with [...] "Benedictus qui venit", which it sings after the consecration.|$|E
2500|$|Canon of the Mass [...] The Canon of the Mass is said by the celebrant {{entirely in}} the <b>low</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] The deacon stands {{to the side of}} the celebrant and kneels on the first step for the consecration. [...] Both the host and the chalice are {{elevated}} by the celebrant immediately after they are consecrated. [...] The deacon is responsible for covering and uncovering the chalice with the pall.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{autobiography}} contrasted {{the charm}} of her early life on the reservation with the “iron routine” which she found in the assimilation boarding schools. Zitkala-Ša wrote: “Perhaps my Indian nature is the moaning wind which stirs them [...] now for their present record. But, however tempestuous this is within me, it comes out as the <b>low</b> <b>voice</b> of a curiously colored seashell, which is only for those ears that are bent with compassion to hear it." ...|$|E
60|$|But Helen {{heard nothing}} save the steady clip-clop of hoofs, the clink of chains, the creak and rattle {{of the old}} stage, and {{occasionally}} the <b>low</b> <b>voices</b> of the men above.|$|R
5000|$|The {{piece is}} called 'Artikulation' {{because in this}} sense an {{artificial}} language is articulated: question and answer, high and <b>low</b> <b>voices,</b> polyglot speaking and interruptions, impulsive outbreaks and humor, charring and whispering.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he can try {{his hand}} again." [...] Then {{there was another}} pause. [...] "I had thought, Mr. Finn, {{that you would have}} married," [...] she said in her very <b>lowest</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
