40|$|Today, freight volumes {{on roads}} {{have gone up}} to a level {{that there is a}} need for {{alternative}} transport modes. Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is one alternative with a potential that can help reduce the high traffic on roads. Most SSS systems use vessels whereby cargo is rolled on and off using a ramp with very small capacities usually less than 500 TEU, but with increasing cargo traffic, it is not clear if such solutions will be efficient. For ports involved in SSS to meet up this new wave of change, the challenge to make appropriate investments and analysis tools is important. The type of vessel suitable for a SSS operation (such as roll-on roll-off (RoRo), <b>lift-on</b> <b>lift-off</b> (LoLo) etc) has been addressed in this thesis based on their compatibility and cost effectiveness with the terminal equipments. The purpose of this study is to develop an optimization model that can be incorporated into a Computer Decision Support System (DSS) for selecting equipments including ships at a strategic level for investments in handling unitised cargo at port terminals in the context of Short Sea Shipping (SSS). The main contribution of the thesis is the application of computer science techniques in the domain of strategic decision making related to the configuration of complex systems (e. g. interrelationships between ships and equipments) with choices of handling equipment. From modelling the selection of port terminal equipments for SSS, we realised that while integer linear programming is a promising approach for studying such systems, it remains a challenge to handle complex issues in depth especially in relation to the quay crane due to interdependencies between time, cost and capacity of equipments. Model results indicates that a LoLo vessel with a capacity between (500 and 1000 TEU) capable of completing a SSS voyage such that handling is done within 48 hours will be less costly than a RoRo that does it with multiple voyages or one voyage each for multiple RoRo vessels for TEU volumes greater than 1000. But RoRo vessels remain useful for trailers that cannot be transported by LoLo vessels. containers. Lotsgatan 14 374 35, Karlshamn Mobile: 0046 768 85 67 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is that of {{analysing}} the available sources of information for the Italian roll‐on roll‐off and underlining {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this data. As a matter of fact in the Short Sea Shipping the roll‐on roll‐off transport represents an important leg of the intermodal maritime combined transport. For this reason and considering the accessibility to the data made possible by the Information Communication Technologies, the analysis of this mode of transport should be simple, yet in reality it is not so. Actually the chosen sector does not always register the availability and quality of information that is present for other types of transport (such as container <b>lift‐on</b> <b>lift‐off</b> or cruises). Even though the roll‐on roll‐off transport is the core of the Motorways of the Sea, the historical series for the Italian market that can be consulted often present a certain amount of gaps. In fact, if on the one hand the official statistics published periodically by the Port Authorities contain information on the volume of annually handled goods, on the other, this same elaborations are not always comprehensive (especially in less structured ports) on the most significant features of the traffic flows, such as the origin and destination of the maritime relations. To solve this problem, it is possible to use some analysis carried out at central level (by the Italian Institute of Statistics and Eurostat) that could be useful to overcome the existing gaps, yet the chosen measure units differ from that of the Port Authorities. Here lies the main difficulty of reaching a sufficiently detailed description of the market that should support the choices of the operators but in particular the formulation of actions aimed at fostering modal shift from road to sea. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 concerns the introduction and methodological aspects; Section 2 addresses the Italian scenario and defines the sample (most important ports regarding Italian roll-on roll‐off market); Section 3 Takes into account the main relations of Short Sea Shipping and it focuses the analysis on some features of the traffic flows in the chosen ports. Section 4 contains some final considerations regarding the exploitation of the sources of information and the improvement of the roadsea combined transport's appeal...|$|R

40|$|Patterned surface {{modification}} for controlled interfacing of biological and electronic components {{is important for}} molecular and cellular bioelectronics. Appropriate patterning processes should be compatible with sensitive biological elements. Furthermore, high resolution, large area patterning and the fabrication of user-defined patterns are desired. Considering these requirements, Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) {{has been used in}} the scope of this work in order to do surface patterning for bioelectronic applications. On the one hand, general technological aspects of Nanoimprint Lithography have been investigated to improve the patterning process, on the other hand, specific patterning processes have been developed and used for bioelectronic applications. Patterning by Nanoimprint Lithography was mainly done with polymers as stamp materials. At first, high resolution master were fabricated in order to replicate polymer stamps of them (by casting or hot embossing). Different thermoplastic polymer foils have been identified as stamp materials with excellent mechanical and chemical properties for the employment in Nanoimprint Lithography. These relatively stiff materials showed good and reliable patterning fidelity down to the size range of 30 nm even at high pressure. Contrary, softer polymer stamps underwent significant deformation during the printing process. This behavior has been intensively analyzed in the scope of this work. It has been found that the relative deformation of the stamp structures depends on the structure size. Smaller structures {{have been found to be}} more sensitive against deformation than larger structures. By decreasing the distance between structures in the stamp design, absolute deformation could be reduced and the dependence of relative deformation on structure size could be eliminated. For chemical surface patterning a UV based NIL process has been developed using a two-layer <b>lift-off</b> resist <b>system</b> and a stiff polymer mold. This process was applied to the fabrication of planar metal structures usable for molecular electronics. Furthermore, the process was used to locally functionalize surfaces in the sub- 100 nm range without creating an additional topography contrast. These chemical templates were applicable for in-situ immobilization of functional building blocks such as polylysine (PLL) and gold nanoparticles. The colloids could be deposited on the surface with varied density by adjusting the hydrodynamic radius of the particles. In this way, nanoparticles could be arranged on the surface with a resolution of up to single particles. Finally, structures decorated with colloids have been successfully utilized as substrates for the controlled growth of embryonic rat neurons. The nanoparticle structures were made selectively repulsive or attractive for the cells by successive {{surface modification}}s. Gold colloids functionalized with amino groups and hence carrying positive charges have been found to be very suitable for the adhesion of neurons...|$|R
40|$|Legged {{locomotion}} is {{an example}} of a discrete event system (DES) with only synchronization and no concurrency. This particular kind of DES can be framed in max-plus algebra, which consists of maximization and addition as its basic operations. Utilizing the max-plus operations between matrices, max-plus linear (MPL) system is constructed. Switching max-plus linear (SMPL) system is a class of MPL system where the element of the system matrices can be changed by a switching function. In modeling legged locomotion as an SMPL system, the touchdown and lift-off time instant of every leg is set as the states. The SMPL system is then used to schedule when each leg should touchdown and lift-off the ground. The swing period of a leg starts with lift-off and ends with touchdown. The stance period of a leg starts with touchdown and ends with <b>lift-off.</b> The SMPL <b>system</b> then incorporates the gait and the desired swing and stance period, to schedule the touchdown and lift-off time instant of every leg. The legged robot which is considered in is called Zebro. Zebro is a robot with six half-circular legs, developed in TU Delft. In this report, the trajectory-following SMPL system for Zebro is proposed. With the trajectory-following SMPL system, a Zebro is able to move forward in all directions by means of the legs scheduling. To turn, Zebro needs to have different linear velocity on the left and right side. While the Zebro is turning with the trajectory-following SMPL system, the stance period of the inner legs are longer by tp seconds compared to the outer legs. On the other hand, the swing period inner legs are shorter by tp seconds compared the outer legs. The motion of the Zebro is predicted by the switching kinematic algorithm in this report. Based on the relation between coordinate frames, first Jacobian matrices of the legs are formed. Each jacobian matrix describes the relationship between the motion of a leg and the motion of Zebro. The jacobian matrices are combined in the sensed forward solution, to predict the motion of Zebro if there are several legs on stance period. The switching kinematic algorithm will detect which legs are on the stance period, and the change of angle of the respective legs. The switching kinematic algorithm then forms a suitable sensed forward solution. The results of the simulation show that the Zebro can turn by the trajectory-following SMPL system. In general, if the tp is increased, the turning radius of Zebro is smaller. However, the Zebro does not always turn to the intended direction. To predict the trajectory of Zebro, a switching kinematic algorithm can be used. The switching kinematic algorithm can predict the trajectory of Zebro if a certain lower boundary of tp is exceeded. The Zebro can also turn to the intended direction if that lower boundary is exceeded. The results of the simulation still cannot be verified by the results of the implementation.

40|$|Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H-NMR) {{is known}} to be an {{versatile}} method for accurately determining the content and the binding degree of moisture in solid materials. In industrial applications it is used as a laboratory method for moisture determination in foodstuffs, powders and other bulk materials. As an hindrance of conventional instrumentation, it is not suited for building inspection. During measuring the sample has to placed into the probe interior. Furthermore, conventional NMR equipment is not portable. Even though, the physical principle of the method is nondestructive, in case of large or stationary objects (e. g. building wall), it is necessary to take a sample. By this, appearance or even functionality of the specimen will be damaged. With a view to use NMR for oil-well logging, respectively for moisture measurements in near-surface soils, already in the early eighties instrumentation have been developed for measuring NMR signals in objects external to the probe. For the first time, this one-sided access (OSA) technology opened up the possibility to use NMR in a completely nondestructive manner. But up to now, the equipment of this technology have been oversized by far, to use it for on-site application on building components. The testing system "NMR-INSPECT" is the worldwide first completely portable, battery-powered moisture measuring system based on one-sided access nuclear magnetic resonance (OSA-NMR). At present, is the only completely nondestructive method for depth-profiling of the moisture content in one-sided application to the component. Compared to earlier OSA-NMR technology, the size of the electronic device of this equipment was reduced by more than the factor twenty. This was achieved by using miniaturized highly efficient electronic components. The sensor design was optimized by application of numerical methods for maximizing the ratio between efficiency and weight and by utilizing new magnet materials with highest energy-density. In contrast to prior equipment, "NMR-INSPECT" allows to vary the measuring depth without changing the distance between probe and specimen surface (constant <b>lift-off).</b> The measuring <b>system</b> determines a depth-profile of the content and the mobility of hydrogen in the material. The hydrogen content is proportional to the moisture content. Based on the molecular mobility of the hydrogen, the binding degree of water can be characterized. By this means, chemically/ physically bonded moisture as well as free moisture can be determined individually. The accuracy of moisture content measurements in porous solids is between 0. 3 and 1 mass-%. Monitoring a depth-profile up to 25 mm with a depth-increment of 1 mm will take approximately 30 minutes. Depth-resolved measuring of the moisture distribution allows to determine the moisture penetration depth. By comparison the moisture profile before and after a defined one-sided wetting, the water permeability of a building material can be determined and by this means, its tightness against pollutant penetration can be evaluated. Since the method is contact-free, it is also applicable in case of components with pronounced surface roughness. During hardening of cement stone, the binding state of water in concrete is changing continuously, originating a decided effect on the NMR signals. Investigations on different mortar mixtures have shown a clear correlation between NMR measuring signals and the (bending) compressive strength, which was determined with a destructive reference method...|$|R
