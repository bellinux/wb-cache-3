5|$|The DLM won {{its first}} {{parliamentary}} seat in Lebanon's 2005 elections representing the Tripoli district. On 2 June 2005, amid election rounds, Samir Kassir, {{a founder of}} the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{there was a}} growing number of intellectuals (Samir Kassir, Ziad Majed, Elias Khoury) and a network of {{independent}} student groups ("Independent Leftist Groups") who advocated democracy, individual liberties, secularism and center-left economic policies in Lebanon. On the other hand, a growing number <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the status of their party: the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the failure of the LCP to assume a more democratic socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E
5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
50|$|His fierce {{criticism}} {{against the}} <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> policies, especially its positive {{attitude towards the}} Syrian occupation of Lebanon and his rejection of the communist ideology, led him in 2004 to form, {{with a group of}} Lebanese intellectuals including Samir Kassir, The Democratic Left Movement.In which, he was elected as its chairperson on 17 October 2004 and was reelected in April, 2007.|$|R

25|$|Prime {{suspects}} {{include the}} pro-Syrian {{faction of the}} Lebanese Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), {{in collaboration with the}} Ba'ath Party. In June 2005, former secretary general of the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> George Hawi claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera, that Rifaat al-Assad, brother of Hafez al Assad and uncle of Syria's current President Bashar al-Assad, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt.|$|E
25|$|The Regional Branch was {{strongest in}} the city of Tripoli. In the 1960 elections, Abd al-Majid al-Rafei was just a few votes short of being elected to parliament. However, a {{persistent}} problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the Regional Branch by the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> In Tripoli the Communists supported the candidacy of Rashid Karami, to ensure themselves of a Regional Branch victory. On 17 July 1961 a group of rival Ba'athists led by Rimawi opened fire on several of the Regional Branch's members.|$|E
25|$|After the Multinational Force (MNF) {{withdrew from}} Beirut in February 1984, Amal {{took control of}} West Beirut, {{establishing}} a number of outposts and checkpoints around the camps (in Beirut, {{but also in the}} south). On 15 April 1985, an alliance gathering Amal, PSP and the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (LCP) militia, the Popular Guard, attacked the Al-Mourabitoun, the main Lebanese Sunni Nasserite militia and the closest ally of the PLO in Lebanon. The Al-Mourabitoun was vanquished after a week of street-fighting and their leader, Ibrahim Kulaylat sent into exile.|$|E

25|$|The Shi'a militias {{were slow}} to form and join in the fighting. Initially, many Shi'a had sympathy for the Palestinians and a few had been drawn to the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> but after 1970s Black September, {{there was a sudden}} influx of armed Palestinians to the Shi'a areas. South Lebanon's {{population}} is mainly Shi'a and the Palestinians soon set up base there for their attacks against the Israelis. The Palestinian movement quickly squandered its influence with the Shi'ite, as radical factions ruled by the gun in much of Shi'ite-inhabited southern Lebanon, where the refugee camps happened to be concentrated, and the mainstream PLO proved either unwilling or unable to rein them in.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{this were}} the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (LCP) and the more radical and {{independent}} Communist Action Organization (COA). Another notable example was the pan-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which promoted the concept of Greater Syria, in contrast to Pan-Arab or Lebanese nationalism. The SSNP was generally aligned with the Syrian government, although it did not ideologically approve of the Ba'athist government (however, this has changed recently, under Bashar Al-Assad, the SSNP having been allowed to exert political activity in Syria as well). The multi-confessional SSNP was led by Inaam Raad, a Catholic and Abdallah Saadeh, a Greek Orthodox. It was active in North Lebanon (Koura and Akkar), West Beirut (around Hamra Street), in Mount Lebanon (High Metn, Baabda, Aley and Chouf), in South Lebanon (Zahrani, Nabatieh, Marjayoun and Hasbaya) and the Beqqa Valley (Baalbeck, Hermel and Rashaya).|$|E
25|$|The 2006–2008 Lebanese protests were {{a series}} of {{political}} protests and sit-ins that began on December 1, 2006, led by groups in Lebanon that opposed the US and Saudi-backed government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and ended on May 21, 2008 following the Doha Agreement. The opposition group {{was made up of}} Hezbollah, Amal, and the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM); a number of smaller parties were also involved, including the Marada party, the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The majority {{of the members of the}} government were part of the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, a coalition of political parties and independents in Lebanon. The two groups were also divided along religious lines, with most Sunnis and Druze supporting the government, and most Shi'a supporting the opposition group. The Christian community was split between the two factions, with Michel Aoun, the leader of the FPM, claiming to have more than 70% support among the Christians, according to the results of the 2005 parliamentary elections.|$|E

25|$|During the June 1982 Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon the PSP/PLA remained neutral, with Walid Jumblatt refusing to allow PLO units to operate within Druze territory and the PSP militia forces did not {{fought against the}} Israel Defense Forces (IDF), even though they supported their arch-enemies the Maronite Kataeb Party and its military arm, the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia. However, when President Amine Gemayel refused to grant the Druze community the expected political representation, Walid Jumblatt formed in response on July 1983 a Palestinian- and Syrian-backed military coalition, the Lebanese National Salvation Front (LNSF), that rallied several Lebanese Muslim and Christian parties and militias opposed to the U.S.-sponsored May 17 Agreement with Israel. Led by Jumblatt's PSP/PLA, the alliance gathered its rivals of the Druze Yazbaki clan, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Al-Mourabitoun and the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (LCP)/Popular Guards, which fought the LF, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the U.S. Marines contingent of the Multinational Force (MNF) in the Chouf and Aley Districts and at West Beirut between September 1983 and February 1984.|$|E
