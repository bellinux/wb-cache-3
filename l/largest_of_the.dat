5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within {{the outer edge of}} the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner moons of Uranus and {{the only}} one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail.

They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E

Throughout the eighteenth century, Worthington sales were mostly of porter, directed towards the Baltic market, which was transported via narrowboat through the River Trent to the Port of Hull. Largely {{as a result of}} this trade, by the time of Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington & Co. ranked among the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provincial breweries.|$|E
5|$|Cadet nurses {{came from}} across the nation and from all backgrounds.

Attrition rates for cadets were {{comparable}} to those reported for other nursing schools in the same period. The corps was the <b>largest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing during the war.|$|E
