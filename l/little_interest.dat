5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The {{view that}} no amount of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of <b>little</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further U.S. {{expansion}} {{has been}} occasionally proposed informally However, the league itself has expressed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in these proposals and U.S. expansion {{has not been}} formally explored.

5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in women, {{but when}} he was in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington {{recommended}} twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.|$|E
5|$|James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in {{the area}} or in the {{traditional}} role of the Lord of the Manor. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of Gray's Inn as a country residence.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in raising a child, but {{may have felt}} that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 {{she gave birth to}} their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E

5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in the property. Okehampton Castle {{does not seem to}} have played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|According to Jim Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H. Jones Center for Economic and Demographic Forecasting at Rice Center, a Rice University-affiliated urban research center, {{the development of these}} apartment complexes was not well planned or coordinated. There was often <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in building a quality product as developers were primarily concerned with generating quick revenue and capitalizing on the deregulation of financial institutions, tax laws favoring apartment construction, inflation, and a housing shortage in the Houston metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, he had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great {{charisma}} and force of personality, characteristics {{which made him}} a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander {{had the ability to}} do so.|$|E

5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in the Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E

5|$|Banned from competition, Chambers sought {{alternative}} commercial {{outlets for}} his athletic prowess. He had an unsuccessful American football try-out with the San Francisco 49ers, hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah. He drifted {{on to the}} celebrity circuit, appearing on British reality television series Hell's Kitchen in May 2004. However, Chambers had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in the show and soon chose to leave. He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Broder Lysholm Knudtzon (5 October 178820 March 1864) was a Norwegian merchant, {{politician}} and benefactor. Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in the everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of}} the English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kneale {{was once again}} {{regularly}} writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled Quatermass. This time John Mills played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled The Quatermass Conclusion or Quatermass IV, for distribution abroad. There was, however, <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in cricket and, {{although}} their relationship {{developed during the}} early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted {{and she began to}} take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died {{unexpectedly}} from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne.

Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> in his {{official}} duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E
