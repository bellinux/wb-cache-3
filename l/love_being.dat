5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I <b>love</b> <b>being</b> in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for eleven Academy Awards, and won five including Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, and Best Director for Spielberg, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in <b>Love,</b> <b>being</b> {{one of a few}} that have won the Best Director award without also winning Best Picture. The Academy's decision to not award the film with the Best Picture Oscar has resulted in much criticism in recent years, with many considering it as one of the biggest snubs in the ceremony's history.|$|E

500|$|I {{like being}} home, having my routines, looking after my garden {{and playing with}} my dog, but I also love playing. I <b>love</b> <b>being</b> able to do both ...

500|$|... "It’s {{about me}} and my ex-boyfriend, and our tumultuous, {{psychotic}} relationship. We’d act weird, like drug addicts with each other, calling {{and seeing each other}} all the time. I was in love at the time, and (the song) sounds pretty happy, but it’s {{a little bit of a}} dark song. You’re so obsessed with somebody you start acting like a weirdo. … I write about falling in <b>love,</b> <b>being</b> in love, breaking up because he’s a loser, being heartbroken. I not only sing about getting rowdy, but love." ...|$|E
500|$|So, {{this song}} is about faith, but it's also about finding faith in other places, in the beyond, and my {{experience}} with <b>love</b> <b>being</b> something that took me up a really long time to find. So it's really psychedelic and it really takes you on a journey [...] I kinda got this lot of different inspiration from this sort of futuristic disco meets late 70s and jazz and this really really kinda gooey deep groove [...] This song is really about sex, but it's about sex on the most mythological way.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his {{unsuccessful}} coaching {{tenure at}} Notre Dame, Faust's {{love for the}} school has never wavered and he still regularly attends Irish home football games.

500|$|Andersen biographer Alison Prince {{believes}} the tale to be a parable representing {{the different kinds}} of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into [...] "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of <b>love,</b> <b>being</b> enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains [...] "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Alan J. W. Bell {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph that the BBC had not yet commissioned a new series and that bosses at the network told him one would not be produced.

The BBC denied these claims, saying that a decision had not yet been reached whether to commission another series or not.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for a television adaptation came when executive producer Andy Harries saw the novel while {{at an airport}} and took it on holiday with him. He did not manage to read it before returning to Britain, but pitched the idea to Sky's Head of Drama Elaine Pyke, who commissioned it anyway. Pyke and Harries had enthusiasm for the novel, and were excited {{to take up the}} challenge to adapt it for television. It was planned to be shot in high-definition because, according to Pyke; [...] "Sky1 HD drama is about trying to astound audiences, up the creative bar, and commission shows which make audiences <b>love</b> <b>being</b> Sky subscribers." [...] After seeing the success from previous dramas such as Terry Pratchett's Hogfather and The Take, Sky made a multimillion-pound commitment to Strike Back.|$|E

It was released to radio stations on March 13, 2015, as the album's second single. The song was written by Madonna, Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, and produced by Madonna, Billboard and Evigan. Madonna had listened to Douglas's previous works and had requested studio time with him. Together with the other songwriters, they wrote [...] "Ghosttown" [...] in three days. A pop ballad, the song {{was inspired by the}} imagery of a destroyed city after armageddon, and how the survivors carry on with their lives, with <b>love</b> <b>being</b> the only thing they can hold onto. An uplifting track, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] features an organ and drums in its instrumentation, with minor vocoder effects on Madonna's vocals.|$|E
500|$|Extras for {{the shoot}} were not told what was {{expected}} of them until the last minute, {{in order to keep the}} content of the video as secret as possible.

500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with <b>love,</b> <b>being</b> rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the song}} [...] "a decidedly {{lubricious}} duet", Alex Needham of New Musical Express said that [...] "She sings about boys, he sings about girls. A simple concept, but an effective one, resulting in Britney’s best single [...] ages." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that The Neptunes' productions on the album, [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] "swaddle her in writhing, kick-the-can beats, but {{never have a}} groove and a verse been so betrayed by a limp chorus." [...] Nicki Tranter of PopMatters said that {{the remainder of the}} album was [...] "tried and tested" [...] dance-pop, noting [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] revisiting [...] "old Britney territory exploring predictable issues including her <b>love</b> <b>being</b> irreplaceable, her use of the dance floor as an appropriate courting place, and her much-loved girl-ness." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "popping, Janet-esque groove." [...] Yale Daily News writer Catherine Halaby considered the song [...] "an envelope-pushing (when you consider her claims of wholesomeness) smutfest." ...|$|E

Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I <b>love</b> <b>being</b> a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that."

While I was Victorian proper and wouldn't let myself get dirty or muddy, Matthew had {{a great sense of}} fun and danger. He was a daredevil and could have been a race car driver.

500|$|Having {{refused to}} betray Yaotl in {{exchange}} for serving the Generals, April, Casey and the Foot Clan work together, searching for the final monster, the Sea Monster, while the Turtles fight the generals. Splinter and Yaotl fight off numerous monsters emerging from the portal. April, Casey and Karai arrive at the tower with the Sea Monster. The Sea Monster crashes into the Generals, dragging them into the portal before it closes. Karai warns them to enjoy their victory while it lasts, claiming they will soon contend with faces from their past, which the Turtles suspect to be the Shredder. She {{and the rest of}} the Foot Clan depart. Yaotl, now mortal, honors the Turtles and Splinter, thanking them for fulfilling his wish before dissipating. Splinter places Yaotl's helmet among his trophy collection, as well as Raphael's [...] "Nightwatcher" [...] helmet and Michelangelo's [...] "Cowabunga Carl" [...] head. As they return to their roles as the shadowy guardians of New York City, Raphael says that the Turtles will always be brothers. He ends the film with the familiar saying, [...] "Oh, I <b>love</b> <b>being</b> a turtle." ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their <b>love,</b> <b>being</b> too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long as I have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I <b>love</b> <b>being</b> part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E
