25|$|In {{the ancient}} Andean civilizations such as Inca Empire, slings {{were made from}} <b>llama</b> <b>wool.</b> These slings {{typically}} have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean slings were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship can result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial slings were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial slings are used {{in parts of the}} Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the animals will move away from the sound of a stone landing. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was some}} weeks later. It {{was now the}} middle of November, and Mr. Britling, very warmly wrapped in his thick dressing-gown and his thick <b>llama</b> <b>wool</b> pyjamas, was sitting at his night desk, and working ever and again at an essay, an essay of preposterous ambitions, {{for the title of}} it was [...] "The Better Government of the World." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} the mules were brought round to the door at sunrise, and Harry and his brother sallied out from the hotel, dressed {{for the first time}} in the Peruvian costume. They were both warmly clothed. On their heads were felt hats with broad brims, which could be pulled down and tied over the ears, both for warmth and to prevent their being blown away by the fierce winds that sweep down the gorges. A thick poncho of <b>llama</b> <b>wool</b> fell from their {{shoulders}} to their knees, and loosely tied round their necks were thick and brightly-coloured scarves. They wore high boots, and carried large knives stuck in a strap below the knee. The rifles were fastened at the bow of their saddles, and their wallets, with provisions for the day, were strapped behind. By the advice of Dias each had in his pocket a large pair of green goggles, to protect their eyes from the glare of sun and snow. They tied these on before coming downstairs, and both agreed that had they met unexpectedly in the street they would have passed each other without the slightest recognition.|$|E
50|$|The {{color and}} length of the <b>llama's</b> <b>wool</b> is variable, {{depending}} on the race. The diameter of <b>llama</b> <b>wool's</b> fiber varies between 20 and 80 micrometers, {{depending on whether the}} llamas were raised for its wool or as a pack animal.|$|R
50|$|Textiles {{and other}} {{products}} created from alpaca, <b>llama,</b> or sheep <b>wool</b> are characteristic of the area. They also make musical instruments like the siku (wind instrument) and the charango. The Toritos de Pucara are the most impressive ceramic pieces made.|$|R
5000|$|Chullo ( [...] , from ch'ullu) is an Andean {{style of}} hat with earflaps, made from vicuña, alpaca, <b>llama</b> or sheep's <b>wool.</b> Alpaca has wool-like qualities {{that help to}} {{insulate}} its wearer from the harsh elements in the Andean Mountain region. Chullos often have ear-flaps that can be tied under the chin, to further warm the wearer's head.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the wool}} that Awamaki weavers work with is shorn {{from their own}} sheep and alpaca. <b>Llama</b> <b>wool</b> is also used, but being very coarse it is used only for {{utilitarian}} items such as sacks, ropes and horse blankets.|$|E
50|$|Andean {{textiles}} {{represent a}} continuing textile tradition spanning {{at least ten}} thousand years. Fiberwork {{has been found in}} Guitarrero Cave, Peru dates back to 8000 BCE. Beginning with non-loom, twined cotton fabric, this textile tradition expanded to include alpaca and <b>llama</b> <b>wool.</b> Today Andean weavers are known worldwide for their skills and rich traditions.|$|E
50|$|Other animal {{textiles}} {{which are}} made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, vicuña wool, <b>llama</b> <b>wool,</b> and camel hair, generally used {{in the production of}} coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the angora rabbit. Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox.|$|E
5000|$|People of {{this region}} {{cultivate}} barley, potatoes and maca. Alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos are raised for <b>wool,</b> and <b>llamas</b> for <b>wool</b> and transport.Human habitation in the puna is widespread and tends to increase to the east, toward the moister areas. Native tubers and grains are cultivated over {{large areas of the}} central puna. The inhabitants {{of this region}} cultivate native tubers (potatoes and maca) along with non-native grains such as barley and native pseudocereals such as quinoa. Alpacas, vicuñas, llamas, and guanacos are raised for wool and, as a result, most of the entirety of the puna is under the effect of animal grazing. Cattle, horses, and donkeys are localized in the wet/humid puna while llama, sheep and alpaca can be raised in both the wet and drier areas of the puna. [...] Fire often accompanies grazing as a management tool {{and is one of the}} main threats to the grasslands. The drier areas are being threatened with progression to desertification.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not much}} surprised, for of course I got the subject {{up as much}} as I could before starting; and Barnett told me that Lima was {{altogether}} an exceptional place, and that while it was bright and warm during the winter months, from May till November on the plains only a few miles away, even in the summer months there was almost always a clammy mist at Lima, and that inside the house as well as outside everything streamed with moisture. He said that this had never been satisfactorily accounted for. Some say that it is due to the coldness of the river here--the Rimac-- which comes down from the snowy mountains. Others think that the cold wind that always blows down the valley of the river meets the winds from the sea here, and the moisture contained in them is thus precipitated. I believe that a few miles higher up we shall get out of this atmosphere altogether. Still, the ponchos will be very useful, for it will be really cold up in the mountains. They serve for cloaks in the daytime and blankets at night. The best are made of the wool of the guanacos, a sort of <b>llama.</b> Their <b>wool</b> is very fine, and before we start we will get two of coarser wool to use as blankets to sleep on, while we have the finer ones to cover us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The St Kilda Football Club {{itself was}} not formed until 1873, {{containing}} many {{elements of the}} previously strong South Yarra club which had disbanded a year earlier, after falling on hard times. South Yarra had won the Challenge Cup in 1867 {{and many of its}} better players lined up under the St Kilda banner. In the early stages the club played at an area known as the [...] "Alpaca Paddock", next to the present site of the St Kilda Bowling Club near the St Kilda railway station. Alpacas were a kind of <b>llama</b> with long <b>wool</b> which had been imported from South America as a money-raising venture. St Kilda soon boasted a membership of 60 and showed that it would exceed its initial aim of being a junior club. By {{the end of the first}} season the Saints were able to force a draw with the top-ranking Carlton and everything looked rosy. There were tough times ahead but St Kilda's uphill battle was not without its humorous moments. Only 12 St Kilda players turned up for a match in Bendigo and the game against Albert Park started 90 minutes late after the ball burst when it was being inflated prior to the match. Amalgamation with University did not help the cause either, but the club was still one of the original members of the VFA when it was formed in 1877. That year St Kilda became only the second team to journey interstate (Melbourne had gone to South Australia a fortnight earlier) and beat Adelaide, then a combined South Australian side.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy is}} based {{primarily}} on Azángaro's development of livestock production activities, supplemented by agriculture, crafts, trade in agricultural products, consumer goods and non-regional transportation services. No figures are available regarding the provincial gross domestic product, but {{it is known that}} animal exploitation is the largest contributor to the economy by raising cattle, sheep and alpacas, which generate end products such as milk, wool, skins and meat for consumption; also products are obtained for transformation, such as milk for processing into cheese, yogurt for human consumption, sheep, alpaca and <b>llama</b> <b>wool</b> and cow leather.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} of Accha Alta {{began working with}} the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco in 1998. In the beginning {{almost all of the}} association members knew how to weave, but solely used synthetic fibers. Since 1998, the weavers have returned to using natural materials, which includes natural dyes in sheep, alpaca, and <b>llama</b> <b>wool.</b> Accha Alta weavers are very proud of their traditions, and place great emphasis on the young weavers, ensuring that their traditions are carried on into the future. There are approximately 40 adult members in Accha Alta's weaving association and 35 children.|$|E
50|$|In type {{of fabric}} used include <b>llama</b> <b>wool,</b> cotton, chiffon and feathers. Their {{technique}} involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes {{were used to}} paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known {{for the quality of}} their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Birds and deities wearing crescent-like headdresses were one of the more common decorative features. They produced a variety of goods such as clothing, bags, and funeral masks.|$|E
40|$|Felting is {{a unique}} {{attribute}} of animal fibres used {{for the production of}} a range of industrial and apparel textiles. Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare animal fibres or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, cashgora, quivet, camel hair, <b>llama,</b> guanaco, bison <b>wool,</b> cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and cashgora produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of fibre crimp form. It is possible to source cashmere and other animal fibres which have different propensities to felt and therefore to produce textiles which are likely to have different textile properties. <br /...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} income generating activity {{for the two}} local communities has been camelid farming, selling <b>llama</b> <b>wool</b> and meat. With the restriction on fox hunting subsequent to the REA, community members' livelihoods have been negatively affected as the fox is the principal predator of llamas. Before establishment of the REA, flamingo egg sales provided monetary income to locals. The park visitor centre is located in Quetena Chico and tourism is growing steadily as, in 2007 there were over 67,000 visitors, six times the number reported in 1997. In addition to working in the tourist trade, locals pan for gold in the Río Quetena.|$|E

5000|$|Cloth {{was divided}} into three classes. Awaska was used for {{household}} use, and usually made from <b>llama</b> <b>wool.</b> Finer cloth, qunpi, {{was divided into}} two classes: The first, woven by male qunpikamayuq (keepers of fine cloth) from alpaca wool, was collected as tribute from {{throughout the country and}} was used for trade, to adorn rulers and to be given as gifts to political allies and subjects to cement loyalty. The other class of qunpi ranked highest. It was woven in the Acllawasi (acllahuasi) by [...] "aclla" [...] (female virgins of the sun god temple) from vicuña wool and used solely for royal and religious use. These had thread counts of 300 or more per inch, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|A yatiri {{is a full}} {{participant}} in the Aymara community; her special role does not relieve her from the social and agricultural duties shared by all community members. She never makes the first move in healing, but always waits {{for someone who has}} a complaint or a problem to consult her. Just as she is obliged to wait for requests, the yatiri is likewise obliged to treat all who do come to her. She typically exercises her role at home in the presence of either the patient or someone who is acting on the patient's behalf. Occasionally, the yatiri's ritual helpers will indicate that she must treat the patient in person, or travel to a ritual place in order to give an offering. She will also practice outside her home if the patient requests such. The principal helper in the yatiri's curing ceremony is the riwutu or human skull. Riwutu are ancestors who have been killed, usually by [...] "robbers," [...] and are seen as an intermediary between the world of humans and that of the dead. The riwutu is placed together with saxra bullets (small pieces of metal or stone that have been fused together by lightning), as well as with tari <b>llama</b> <b>wool,</b> coca, and sculptures of the saints. If the yatiri has been asked to discover a lost object or one taken by thieves, she may use candles in her ceremony. If she is to heal somebody ill, she may use a piece of cloth-- isi-- that has touched the patient.|$|E
40|$|The weavers of the Kolla Community of the Argentine Andean {{highlands}} or Puna, show strong {{preferences for}} the use of certain color combinations. These preferences seem to be more stable over time than their use of traditional technology and materials, which change more often according to utilitarian reasons. As it happens with food preferences, the use of color can show a strong sign of cultural identity that, in this case, can be traced to pre-columbian times. During our work with traditional Andean weavers from seven communities in the Humahuaca Valley and Altiplano of Jujuy (about 800 families), we came across several interesting examples of this phenomenon. The goals of our program combine the creation of new sources of employment for these economically marginal communities with the restoration of traditional Andean textile designs and techniques, including the use of <b>llama</b> <b>wool,</b> hand spinning, dyeing with local plants and minerals, and loom weaving. We believe the best way of organizing teaching and production is by strengthening the Andean communal forms of organization and exchange...|$|E
