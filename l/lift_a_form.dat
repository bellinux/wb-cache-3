The Levapad required extremely flat surfaces to work on, either metal plates, or as originally intended, the very smooth concrete of a factory floor. Kucher eventually became VP in charge of the Ford Scientific Laboratory, continuing development of the Levapad concept throughout.|$|R

5000|$|Instead {{of trying}} to go {{directly}} from the elliptic curve to the modular form, one can first pass to the (...) representation for some ℓ and n, and from that to the modular form. In the case ℓ = 3 and n = 1, results of the Langlands-Tunnell theorem show that the (mod 3) representation of any elliptic curve over Q comes from <b>a</b> modular <b>form.</b> The basic strategy is to use induction on n to show that {{this is true for}} ℓ = 3 and any n, that ultimately there is <b>a</b> single modular <b>form</b> that works for all n. To do this, one uses a counting argument, comparing the number of ways in which one can <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> (...) Galois representation to (...) and the number of ways in which one can <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> (...) modular <b>form.</b> An essential point is to impose a sufficient set of conditions on the Galois representation; otherwise, there will be too many lifts and most will not be modular. These conditions should be satisfied for the representations coming from modular forms and those coming from elliptic curves. If the original (mod 3) representation has an image which is too small, one runs into trouble with the lifting argument, and in this case, there is a final trick, which has since taken {{on a life of its}} own with the subsequent work on the Serre Modularity Conjecture. The idea involves the interplay between the (mod 3) and (mod 5) representations. (Again, see Chapter 5 of the Wiles paper for this 3/5 switch.) ...|$|R

There is an induced action on the K-homology of A, which turns out to be trivial. Moreover, this action leads naturally to a simpler object, the polarized module underlying a given Fredholm module, and we discuss this relation in detail.

40|$|Let Mπ X be a {{principal}} elliptic fibration over a Kaehler base X. We {{assume that the}} Kaehler form on X is <b>lifted</b> to <b>an</b> exact <b>form</b> on M (such fibrations are called positive). Examples of these are regular Vaisman manifolds (in particular, the regular Hopf manifolds) and Calabi-Eckmann manifolds. Assume that M > 2. Using the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, we prove that all stable bundles on M are flat on the fibers of the elliptic fibration. This is used to show that all stable vector bundles on M take form L⊗π^* B_ 0, where B_ 0 is a stable bundle on X, and L a holomorphic line bundle. For X algebraic this implies that all holomorphic bundles on M are filtrable (that is, obtained by successive extensions of rank- 1 sheaves). We also show that all positive-dimensional compact subvarieties of M are pullbacks of complex subvarieties on X. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to prove the lifting {{property}} of zero divisors, n-zero divisors, nilpotent elements and a criteria for the lifting of polynomially ideal elements in C*-algebras. Chapter 1 establishes the foundation on which the machinery to prove the lifting properties stated above rests upon. Chapter 2 proves the lifting of zero divisors in C*-algebras. The generalization of this problem to lifting n-zero divisors in C*-algebras requires {{the advent of the}} corona C*-algebra, a result of the school of non-commutative topology. The actual proof reduces the general case to the case of the corona of a non-unital _-unital C*-algebra. Chapter 3 proves the lifting of the property of a nilpotent element also by a reduction to the case of the corona of a non-unital _-unital C*-algebra. The case of the corona of a non-unital _-unital C*-algebra is proved via <b>a</b> <b>lifting</b> of <b>a</b> triangular <b>form</b> in the corona.
