30|$|Due to {{its high}} {{compressive}} strength, more time {{is required to}} break UHPC specimens at low <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> For instance, a 150  ×  300  mm (6  ×  12 in) UHPC cylinder broke after 13  min when a 0.24  MPa/s (35  psi/s) <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> was applied. Therefore, higher <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> up to 1.0  MPa/s (150  psi/s) can be applied without significantly affecting the strength properties of UHPC {{in order to reduce}} the failure time (Kazemi and Lubell 2012; Graybeal et al. 2003). According to AFGC-SETRA (2002) guidelines, a <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> ranging between 0.24 and 1.7  MPa/s (35 – 250 psi/s) affected the UHPC compressive strength by less than 4  %.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nanoindentation {{tests with}} <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 05 mN/s, 0. 1 mN/s, 0. 5 mN/s, and 1. 0 mN/s were {{conducted}} on the Au ball bond. The effect of different loading on the Au ball bond were analysed based on qualitative and quantitative results. The displacement burst was more pronounced with the increment of <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> The increase of hardness value and the decrease of the reduced modulus value when the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> was increased are due {{to the effect of}} creep. It was found that the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 5 mN/s is the appropriate and stable value for the nanoindentation test on the Au ball bond...|$|R
40|$|Cement paste, mortar, and {{concrete}} were studied {{to examine the}} influence of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on operative toughening mechanisms. The fracture toughness of cement paste {{was found to be}} independent of crack length, while mortar {{and concrete}} exhibited strongly rising resistance curves. In the case of cement paste and mortar, the peak fracture toughness was found to be independent of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> Ln concrete, the peak toughness was found to decrease with increasing <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> Surface roughness measurements were performed to understand the effect of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the fracture mechanisms. The roughness analysis coupled with fractography were found to correlate with the toughness measurements...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> {{effects on the}} cracking processes of flaw-contained specimens under compressive loading, rectangular parallelepiped specimens containing centrally located single and double flaw(s) are numerically loaded using the bonded-particle model (BPM). The study reveals that the uniaxial compressive stress (σ c) and coalescence stress (σ c) increase significantly, while the first crack initiation stress (σ ci) only subtly increases {{with the increase of}} <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> The trajectories of the first and secondary cracks become shorter while the amount of discrete micro-cracks increases as the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> increases. The mode of coalescence cracks changes from tensile-segments-dominant to shear-band-dominant when the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> increases. The shape of the stress-strain curves of specimens <b>loaded</b> at different <b>rates</b> also varies. Based on the present study, an upper limit of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 08 m/s deems to be acceptable for cracking processes analysis under static load using the BPM. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of <b>rate</b> of <b>loading</b> on uplift capacity of pries in day is experimentally investigated. Uplift capacity tests were conducted under different <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> using a model steel pile having an outside diameter of 30 mm. In addition, consolidated undrained triaxial tests were performed under the same <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> used in the uplift capacity tests. Experimental results showed an increase in undrained shear strength of the tested soil with the increased <b>rate</b> of <b>loading.</b> Furthermore, the uplift capacity of the model pile was found to Increase as the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> increased. The relationships between <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> and both the undrained shear strength and the uplift capacity can be represented by a straight line on a log-log plot. Theoretical bearing capacity was calculated based on the undrained shear strength measured in the triaxial tests and compared with the measured uplift capacity under the same <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> NORSKE CONOC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{formulation of the}} Rate Type Compaction Model (RTCM) for sandstone based on the isotach concept. The RTCM was originally developed to explain the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> dependent compaction behaviour observed in laboratory test on unconsolidated and consolidated sandstone samples and the delayed subsidence behaviour above depleting reservoirs. The original RTCM equation has the limitation of being unable to describe transitions between different <b>loading</b> <b>rates,</b> including {{the transition to a}} <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of zero (creep). The new formulation combines the features of the original RTCM with the isotach concept developed is soft soil geotechnics, which enables transitions between different <b>loading</b> <b>rates,</b> thereby overcoming the limitations of the original RTCM. The isotach formulation of the RTCM model is used to simulate a multiple <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> experiment on a Rotliegend sandstonwe core sample. The agreement between results of the lab experiment and the proposed isotach RTCM model is excellen...|$|R

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} digestion process is globally {{applied to the}} treatment of highly concentrated wastes such as industrial and rural effluents, and sewage sludge. However, it is known to be relatively unstable. When loaded with high concentrations of organic material, unwanted volatile fatty acids (VFA) are often produced rather than methane (CH(4)) gas which can lead to digester acidification and failure. This study investigated digester behaviour under high <b>loading</b> <b>rates,</b> testing the usefulness of stoichiometric methane conversion efficiency as a digester control parameter at high <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> Our results show that, in general, the CH(4) production rate was proportional to the feed <b>rate</b> (<b>loading</b> <b>rate).</b> However, at very high <b>loading</b> <b>rates,</b> the CH(4) production rate was not proportional to the increase in the feeding rate. Consequently, VFA accumulated and the H(2) partial pressure increased. The proportionality of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> and gas production rate is stoichiometrically expressed as the conversion efficiency. We found that conversion efficiency was a useful indicator as an early warning of digester imbalance. The digester remained stable at conversion efficiencies above 75 %. Dropping below 70 % signified the onset of digester failure. As <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> and methane production data are readily available on-line in most {{anaerobic digestion}} plants, the conversion efficiency can be monitored on-line and used as an efficient control technique to maintain safe operation of anaerobic digesters at high <b>loading</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of an experimental {{study on the}} compressive, time-dependent behavior of graphite fiber reinforced polymer composite laminates with open holes. The effect of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on compressive strength was determined for six material systems ranging from brittle epoxies to thermoplastics at both 75 F and 220 F. Specimens were loaded to failure using different <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> The slope of the strength versus elapsed time-to-failure curve was used to rank the materials' <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity. All of the materials had greater strength at 75 F than at 220 F. All the materials showed <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effects {{in the form of}} reduced failure strength for longer elapsed-time-to-failure. <b>Loading</b> <b>rate</b> sensitivity was less at 220 F than the same material at 70 F. However, C 12000 /ULTEM and IM 7 / 8551 - 7 were more sensitive to <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> than the other materials at 220 F. AS 4 /APC 2 laminates with 24, 32, and 48 plies and 1 / 16 and 1 / 4 inch diameter holes were tested. The sensitivity to <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> was less for either increasing number of plies or larger hole size. The failure of the specimens made from brittle resins was accompanied by extensive delaminations while the failure of the roughened systems was predominantly by shear crippling. Fewer delamination failures were observed at the higher temperature...|$|R
