40|$|Efficient {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} resolution of simulated inflow wind fields is important in order to represent wind turbine dynamics and derive <b>load</b> <b>statistics</b> for design. Using Fourier-based stochastic simulation of inflow turbulence, we first investigate loads for a utility-scale turbine in the neutral atmospheric boundary layer. <b>Load</b> <b>statistics,</b> spectra, and wavelet analysis representations for different space and time resolutions are compared. Next, large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed with space-time resolutions, justified {{on the basis of}} the earlier stochastic simulations, to again derive turbine loads. Extreme and fatigue loads from the two approaches used in inflow field generation are compared. On the basis of simulation studies carried out for three different wind speeds in the turbine’s operating range, it is shown that inflow turbulence described using 10 -meter spatial resolution and 1 Hz temporal resolution is adequate for assessing turbine loads. Such studies on the investigation of adequate filtering or resolution of inflow wind fields help to establish efficient strategies for LES and other physical or stochastic simulation needed in turbine loads studies...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We discuss an {{application}} of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to characterize the in-flow turbulence random field experienced by a wind turbine. A methodology is proposed that employs low-dimensional POD models of the turbulence field to predict the wind turbine <b>load</b> <b>statistics</b> for the design pur-poses. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is assessed by evaluating rates of convergence of <b>load</b> <b>statistics</b> derived based on different numbers of inflow POD modes. Influence on convergence due to different spatial and temporal sampling resolutions of the inflow data is also investigated. Results suggest that the appropriate number of POD modes needed to accurately describe wind turbine blade and tower loads depends primarily on the dynamic characteristics of the turbine loads under consideration {{as well as on}} the rotational sampling of the inflow turbulence. In general, a small number of inflow POD modes can faithfully account for the low-frequency energy in the turbine load measures studied. At higher frequencies, where the inflow turbulence field exhibits weak coherence at spatial separations on the order of rotor dimensions, a larger number of modes may be required. Based on this study limited to a single two-bladed 600 kW wind turbine, results from several spatial and temporal samplings of the inflow turbulence show that data from spatial grids with dimensions on the order of one-third the rotor diameter and sampling frequencies of 2. 5 - 5 Hz or higher can yield adequate representations of important POD modes useful for establishing accurate turbine loads. This was verified by comparing loads resulting from such efficient POD representations of inflow fields with those from sampled data on very fine grids and at high sampling rates. ...|$|E

We use an adaptive mechanism to determine when to perform the domain decomposition. In this approach, <b>load</b> <b>statistics</b> of the tree pieces are collected and domain decomposition is only performed if an imbalance is detected. Otherwise, only particle migration is done based on the previous splitters.

The Danish geotechnical code {{has been based}} on LRFD for several decades, but more recently the Eurocode and the Australian Standards have turned in this direction.

The benefits from higher resource utilization include reduced cost to construct, op-erate, {{and maintain a}} system, which often include energy consumption.

In this paper, we analyze slow-downs of jobs due to contention for multiple resources in a system; referred to as dilation factor.

From this observation, we establish a general quantitative model for dilation factors of jobs in multi-resource systems.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a resource allocation {{problem for a}} satellite network, where variations of fading conditions are added to those of traffic load. Since {{the capacity of the}} system is finite and divided in finite discrete portions, the resource allocation problem reveals to be a discrete stochastic programming one, which is typically NP-hard. We propose a new approach based on the minimization over a discrete constraint set using an estimation of the gradient, obtained through a 'relaxed continuous extension' of the performance measure. The computation of the gradient estimation is based on the infinitesimal perturbation analysis technique, applied on a stochastic fluid model of the network. No closed-forms of the performance measure, nor additional feedback concerning the state of the system, and very mild assumptions on the probabilistic properties about the statistical processes involved in the problem are requested. Such optimization approach is compared with a dynamic programming algorithm that maintains a perfect knowledge {{about the state of the}} satellite network (traffic <b>load</b> <b>statistics</b> and fading levels). The comparison shows that the sensitivity estimation capability of the proposed algorithm allows to maintain the optimal resource allocation in dynamic conditions and it is able to provide even better performance than the one reached by employing the dynamic programming approach...|$|E
