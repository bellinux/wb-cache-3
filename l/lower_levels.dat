5|$|There are wind maxima at <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of the {{atmosphere}} that are {{also referred to as}} jets.|$|E
5|$|Budgetary {{restraints}} in the 1990s {{forced the}} provincial government to sell off or download many highways to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of government, or, {{in the case of}} Highway407, to a private consortium.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the brain and in <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> in other tissues, while Cγ is most likely expressed in the testis.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> two {{swimming}} pools were located, one was {{converted into a}} cafeteria. Tile with a water theme gives a hint to the original use of the cafeteria space. A depressed driveway extending between Cass and Second divides the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of the main building from the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of the Annex.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> caches L2 and L3 are {{accessed}} {{only when}} there is a miss in the L1 cache implies the frequency of access to the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> caches is less compared to the L1 cache. Therefore, the unified organization is implemented in the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> caches as having a single port will suffice.|$|R
50|$|Multi-level caches can be {{designed}} in various ways {{depending on whether the}} content of one cache is present in other level of caches. If all blocks in the higher level cache are also present in the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> cache, then the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> cache is said to be inclusive of the higher level cache. If the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> cache contains blocks that are not present in the higher level cache, then the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> cache is said to be exclusive of the higher level cache. If the contents of the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> cache are neither strictly inclusive nor exclusive of the higher level cache, then it is called non-inclusive non-exclusive (NINE) cache.|$|R
5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{remained}} unchanged {{for over three}} decades, {{with the exception of}} a Connecting Link agreement established between the MTO and the City of Barrie. However, during the late 1990s, the MTO transferred many highways to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of government as a cost-cutting measure. Highway90 was transferred to Simcoe County on January1, 1998.|$|E
5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5000|$|Film {{producers}} {{have used the}} <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platform for several films, most notably Ghost (1990), starring Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. In the late 2000s, the MTA began construction on a planned extension of the IRT Flushing Line to 34th Street, which would require demolishing the IND Eighth Avenue <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platform. , the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platform was being demolished {{as part of the}} Flushing Line extension. Transit blogger Benjamin Kabak, who was invited to tour the Flushing Line extension and view construction progress, reported in February 2012 that the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platform had been [...] "bisected" [...] by the Flushing Line extension. The tunnels slope down through where the old <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platform was.|$|R

5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Following its sale to Lehman Brothers in 1995, One Times Square was re-purposed as an {{advertising}} location {{to take advantage}} of its prime location within the square. Most of the building's interior remains vacant (aside from its only major tenant, a Walgreens pharmacy which occupies its <b>lower</b> <b>levels),</b> while its exterior features a large number of traditional and electronic billboards. Due to the large amount of revenue generated by its ads, One Times Square {{is considered one of the}} most valuable advertising locations in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of the building.|$|E
30|$|Let π(x,y,λ,w)=w^T(b-A_ 1 x)-λ^TDy {{denote the}} duality gap of the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> problem, if π(x,y,λ,w) {{is equal to}} zero, the optimal {{solution}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> problem would be reached.|$|R
50|$|On {{the express}} tracks on the <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> the deep-bore tunnel's round shape becomes square below this station and at 14th Street stations, where {{provisions}} for <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> platforms were built.|$|R
50|$|Link {{is split}} into two traffic levels; the upper level is an open, 3-lane divided highway, while the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is a {{double-track}} railway line used by the MTR Airport Express and Tung Chung Line and also contains two single-lane roads for emergency use in both directions. The speed limit is 80 km/h on the upper level and 50 km/h on the <b>lower</b> <b>level.</b> In normal situations, the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is not used except in special circumstances such as strong wind or serious accidents {{which could lead to}} the closure of the upper <b>level.</b> The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is not connected to Ma Wan.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|In the American federalist system, {{citizens}} are usually subject to {{three levels of}} government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at <b>lower</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{resides in}} fairly dry areas at <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> and damp meadows among trees at alpine levels and {{is found in}} altitudes of 1000–2000 meters. Although it is found around the globe, populations of P. rebeli are {{concentrated}} {{in the northern part}} of Portugal and Greece, the western Pyrenees, France, and eastern part of Germany.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is a Forever 21 Super Store {{which opened}} in December 2012. The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> {{formerly}} housed a family entertainment center, Tilt, complete with an arcade and indoor miniature golf course.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>level</b> councils {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to hold referenda at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to referendum democracy.|$|R
500|$|Pullman-Standard built 102 Superliner I {{coaches and}} 48 coach-baggage {{combination}} cars. Bombardier built 38 Superliner II coaches. As built, Superliner coaches could carry 62 passengers {{in the upper}} level and 15 passengers on the <b>lower</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>lower</b> <b>level's</b> capacity would later be reduced to 12. The coach-baggage cars had a baggage compartment {{in lieu of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> seating area, and squeezed 78 seats into the upper level. The total capacity of 75–78 represented a small increase over the 68–72 on the Hi-Level coaches, which did not have seating on the <b>lower</b> <b>level.</b> The Superliner I coach weighs the Superliner II coach weighs [...]|$|R
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD {{have higher levels of}} stress. Siblings {{of children}} with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings {{of children with}} Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts {{postulate}} four gatis, that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, {{within which}} the soul transmigrates. The four gatis are: deva (demi-gods), manuṣya (humans), nāraki (hell beings) and tiryañca (animals, plants and micro-organisms). The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> where seven hells are situated.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> has two {{tracks and}} two side platforms, {{separated}} by a curtain wall. The northbound track of the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is fed by the northbound local and express tracks at 42nd Street. In the southbound direction, <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> trains may access either the Eighth Avenue local or express tracks; until recently, they also {{had the option of}} running to the abandoned <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of 42nd Street. The two levels are offset, with the upper level running from 50th to 52nd Streets and the lower from 49th to 51st. Neither level has crossover or crossunder between directions, although level-to-level transfer in the same direction is possible.|$|R
50|$|For scheduling, the {{scheduler}} always starts {{picking up}} processes {{from the head}} of the highest level queue. Only if the highest level queue has become empty will the scheduler take up a process from the next <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> queue. The same policy is implemented for picking up in the subsequent <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> queues. Meanwhile, if a process comes into any of the higher level queues, it will preempt a process in the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> queue.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{bridging}} {{structure has}} a passage {{on the northern}} side, with a large room on the southern side to the <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> and two narrow rooms to the upper level. The passage section is earlier and the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> has vertical timber boarding to the walls and a hardboard ceiling with timber cover strips. The rooms have hardboard partition walls and ceiling panels. Three steps access the rear building from the <b>lower</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
