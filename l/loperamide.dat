5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. <b>Loperamide,</b> an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. <b>Loperamide</b> is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
25|$|Medications such as <b>loperamide</b> (Imodium) and {{bismuth subsalicylate}} may be beneficial; however {{they may be}} {{contraindicated}} in certain situations.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} diarrhea-predominate {{irritable}} bowel syndrome, opioids {{may be used}} to suppress diarrhea. <b>Loperamide</b> is a peripherally selective opioid available without a prescription used to suppress diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. Codeine {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although <b>loperamide</b> (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), diphenoxylate, paregoric or even laudanum are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|While bismuth {{compounds}} (Pepto-Bismol) {{decreased the}} number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness. Anti-motility agents like <b>loperamide</b> are also effective at reducing {{the number of}} stools but not the duration of disease. These agents should only be used if bloody diarrhea is not present.|$|E
25|$|Medications used to slow or stop diarrhea, such as <b>loperamide,</b> may worsen C. difficile {{disease and}} {{therefore}} are not recommended. Cholestyramine, an ion exchange resin, {{is effective in}} binding both toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility, and helping prevent dehydration. Cholestyramine is recommended with vancomycin. A last-resort treatment in those who are immunosuppressed is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).|$|E
25|$|While fluid {{replacement}} {{and blood}} pressure support {{may be necessary to}} prevent death from dehydration, most victims recover without treatment in five to 10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and treatment with antibiotics may precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Antidiarrheal agents, such as <b>loperamide</b> (imodium), should also be avoided as they may prolong the duration of the infection.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of diarrhea is {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months. Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed {{through a combination of}} dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as <b>loperamide</b> or codeine. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. <b>Loperamide</b> may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} IBS. Treatment is carried out to improve symptoms. This may include dietary changes, medication, probiotics, and counseling. Dietary {{measures}} include increasing soluble fiber intake, a gluten free diet, or a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP). The medication <b>loperamide</b> {{may be used to}} help with diarrhea while laxatives may be used to help with constipation. Antidepressants may improve overall symptoms and pain. Patient education and a good doctor–patient relationship {{are an important part of}} care.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, <b>Loperamide,</b> Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>loperamide</b> {{and other}} opioids, {{morphine}} acts on the myenteric plexus in the intestinal tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by μ-opioid receptors in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive peristalsis of the intestine, morphine decreases {{the rate of}} intestinal transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased intestinal fluid absorption {{also contribute to the}} constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of nitric oxide generation. This effect was shown in animals when a nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, reversed morphine-induced changes in gut motility.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals. Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so {{it remains to be}} seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, <b>loperamide,</b> and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E
2500|$|Antimotility agents, such as <b>loperamide,</b> {{can lead}} to {{prolonged}} illness or intestinal perforation in any invasive diarrhea, and should be avoided. [...] Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin are ineffective against Campylobacter.|$|E
2500|$|Methylnaltrexone (Methylnaltrexone is only {{peripherally}} {{active as}} it does not cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities to be centrally active. As such, it can be considered the antithesis of <b>loperamide.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} primarily involves fluid rehydration, electrolyte replacement (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose), and antimotility agents (e.g., <b>loperamide).</b> [...] Supplemental zinc {{may improve}} symptoms, particularly in recurrent or persistent infections or in others {{at risk for}} zinc deficiency.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Loperamide</b> (does {{cross the}} blood-brain barrier but is quickly {{pumped into the}} non-central nervous system by P-Glycoprotein. [...] Mild opiate {{withdrawal}} in animal models exhibits this action after sustained and prolonged use including rhesus monkeys, mice, and rats.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit many {{isozymes}} of the cytochrome P450 {{system that}} are involved in drug metabolism. Both are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 (which is also the chief enzyme responsible for their metabolism) and CYP2C19, and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. In vivo, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine do not significantly affect the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. [...] They also inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein, a type of membrane transport protein that {{plays an important role in}} drug transport and metabolism and hence P-glycoprotein substrates such as <b>loperamide</b> may have their central effects potentiated. This extensive effect on the body's pathways for drug metabolism creates the potential for interactions with many commonly used drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Constipation {{is the one}} side-effect of {{dihydrocodeine}} {{and almost}} all opioids which is near-universal. [...] It results from the slowing of peristalsis in the gut and is a reason dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, codeine, opium preparations, and morphine are used to stop diarrhoea and combat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in its diarrhoeal and cyclical forms {{as well as other}} conditions causing hypermotility or intestinal cramping. Opium/opioid preparations are used often as a last resort where pain is severe and the bowels are organically loose. It is generally better to treat IBS with a non psycho-tropic opioid such as <b>loperamide</b> hydrochloride which stays contained in the bowel, thereby not causing drowsy effects and allowing many people to work using machines etc. For IBS, hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan in the UK) and mebeverine hydrochloride (Colofac) can be effective with or without an opium related compound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein; therefore, {{the concentration}} of <b>loperamide</b> will increase when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole, among others. <b>Loperamide</b> is capable of decreasing the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, when saquinavir concentrations can decrease by half when given with <b>loperamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> {{is often}} {{compared}} to diphenoxylate. Recent {{studies suggest that}} <b>loperamide</b> is more effective and has lower neural side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> has {{typically}} {{been deemed}} {{to have a}} relatively low risk of misuse. In 2012, there were no reports of <b>loperamide</b> abuse.|$|E
50|$|Efflux by P-glycoprotein also {{prevents}} circulating <b>loperamide</b> from effectively {{crossing the}} blood-brain barrier, affecting {{the central nervous}} system. Concurrent administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as quinidine potentially allows <b>loperamide</b> to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce central morphine-like effects. <b>Loperamide</b> taken with quinidine was found to produce respiratory depression, indicative of central opioid action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> is not {{recommended}} in the UK for use during pregnancy nor by nursing mothers. In the US, <b>loperamide</b> is classified by the FDA as pregnancy category C. Studies in rat models have shown no teratogenicity, but there have not been sufficient studies in humans. One controlled, prospective study of 89 women exposed to <b>loperamide</b> during the first trimester showed no increased risk of malformations. This, however, was only one study with a small sample size. <b>Loperamide</b> can be present in breast milk, and is {{not recommended}} for breast feeding mothers.|$|E
50|$|In November 1993, <b>loperamide</b> was {{launched}} as an orally disintegrating tablet based on Zydis technology. Imodium Instant Melts from Johnson & Johnson {{is currently the}} only <b>loperamide</b> available {{in the form of}} orally disintegrating tablets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> {{has been}} shown to cause a mild {{physical}} dependence during preclinical studies, specifically in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Symptoms of mild opiate withdrawal were observed following abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment of animals with <b>loperamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> is an opioid-receptor agonist {{and acts}} on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus {{of the large}} intestine. <b>Loperamide</b> works like morphine, {{decreasing}} {{the activity of the}} myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter. <b>Loperamide</b> also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{clinical}} on <b>loperamide</b> {{were published}} in 1973 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry with the inventor {{being one of the}} authors. The trial name for it was [...] "R-18553". <b>Loperamide</b> oxide has a different research code: R-58425.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>loperamide</b> in {{children}} under 2 years is not recommended. There have been rare reports of fatal paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports {{occurred in the}} setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. A review of <b>loperamide</b> {{in children}} under 12 years old, and found that serious adverse events occurred only in children under 3 years old. The study reported that the use of <b>loperamide</b> should be contraindicated in children under 3 years old, systemically ill, malnourished, moderately dehydrated, or have bloody diarrhea. In 1990, all formulations for children of the antidiarrheal <b>loperamide</b> were banned in Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Examples include diphenoxylate, <b>loperamide,</b> and eluxadoline.|$|E

50|$|<b>Loperamide</b> {{should be}} {{administered}} with caution {{to people with}} liver failure due to reduced first pass metabolism. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced HIV as there have been cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with <b>loperamide</b> should be discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Loperamide's {{circulation}} {{in the bloodstream}} is limited in two ways. Efflux by P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall reduces passage of <b>loperamide,</b> and the fraction of drug crossing is then further reduced through first pass metabolism by the liver. <b>Loperamide</b> metabolizes into an MPTP-like compound, but is unlikely to exert neurotoxicity.|$|E
