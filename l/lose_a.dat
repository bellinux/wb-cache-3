5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E

Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2000 college {{football}} season with hopes of following up its {{victory in the}} 2000 Sugar Bowl with another national championship.

Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged on the losing side of a 132 score.
