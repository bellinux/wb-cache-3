40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional underwater light sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the luminous intensity is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an underwater LED lighting module is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the underwater light field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> (LIDC) and axial luminous intensity.

Aim is to measure spatial characteristics of luminous parts of the luminaires and light sources represented by <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> which is needed for lighting computation at level of the preparation of lighting design. Near-field goniophotometry is still a forthcoming technology widely used in photometric laboratories all over the world. Due to compact design of these systems the laboratory space can be saved and they can be installed in a room of usual dimensions because they do not obey the inverse square law from {{point of view of the}} whole dimension of the luminaire. The principle of these goniophotometers of the luminance distribution is measurement of luminous part of the luminaires and light sources. By integration over solid angle from this fundamental photometric quantity luminous intensity in particular direction in the space represented by two angles depending on measurement planes is derived. Although theoretical principle and physical model is well-known and defined, in practical realisation of this system some problems occur. One of the problems is traceability to SI units. This fact disqualifies near-field goniophotometer in standards relating to goniophotometry. The methods to prove that near-field goniophotometer works are mostly based on computer simulations compared with practical measurements. But in the practice, appropriate calibration method with traceability to the SI units is still not available, unlike it is clearly used for farfield goniophotometers. The paper describes possibility of the calibration of near-field goniophotometers to SI units by standards which should provide fully traceable calibration to the base. Also method of validation of near-field goniophotometric systems is still opened question for future work.

40|$|Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 23 - 26 April, 2014 The {{group of}} optical {{radiation}} measurements (GIMRO), in the Institute of Optics of the Spanish National Research Council (IO-CSIC), {{has developed a}} method based on Zernike polynomials to analyze photometric properties of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) from measurements of the angular <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution.</b> The procedure basically consists in fitting the Zernike polynomials to absolute measurements of angular <b>distribution</b> of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> and relative measurements of the angular distribution of luminance. Since the Zernike polynomials describe the wavefront, {{the parameters of the}} fit polynomials can be easily related to the total luminous flux, the degree of Lambertianity, the divergence of the emission by the full width at half maximum (FWHM), its anisotropy and the direction of the optical axis. Zernike polynomials are a complete set of polynomials that are orthogonal over the interior of the unit circle. They allow aberration function to be expanded in a power series. They are usually expressed in polar coordinates (¿,¿), but we expressed them in spherical coordinates (¿,¿) by the transformation [¿=asin(¿), ¿=¿], in order to expand the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> and luminance <b>distribution</b> in power series. The advantage of this procedure is {{that it is possible to}} better understand the variation of the photometric magnitudes on the unit hemisphere from the evaluation of the weights corresponding to every Zernike polynomial. From goniophotometric measurements on 18 high power LED made with our near-field goniophotometer (consisting of two stages of rotation to vary the polar angle and azimuth angle and four stages of linear displacement for centering the LED), it was determined that of the Zernike polynomials: constant term (with weight CCons), defocus function (CDef), primary spherical (CSph), vertical coma (CComaV), horizontal coma (CComaH), vertical tilt (CTiltV), horizontal tilt (CTiltH), vertical astigmatism (CAstigV) and oblique astigmatism (CAstigO), describe well enough the angular distribution of the emission, provided that very high anisotropies aren¿t present. By fitting the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> to Zernike polynomials (letting weights as free parameters), some intrinsic properties of the emission are obtained, as the divergence, the optical axis, the total luminous flux and the anisotropy: LED's divergence (FWHM) is calculated from the weights of the ¿-independent polynomials (CCons, CDef and CSph). The direction of optical axis (in spherical coordinates [¿_ 0,¿_ 0]), solved from the two tilt polynomials and their weights, as the first derivative with respect to x and y. The anisotropy is defined as the standard deviation of the ratio of the ¿-dependent polynomials to the ¿-independent polynomials. Thus, there are an anisotropy value for every polar angle ¿. Total luminous flux (¿) is calculated by integration of the <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> on the sphere. By integration of the Zernike expansion, this magnitude is simply expressed as: ¿= 2 *CCons*¿+ 2 *CDef*¿/¿ 3 + 2 *CSph*¿/¿ 5. A much easier expression for ¿ is obtained if, instead of the luminous intensity¿s, the angular relative luminance distribution is expressed as a Zernike expansion. In this case, the expression is ¿ = CCons * ¿. On the other hand, using this luminance-based approach, Lambertianity of the source can be accounted just by the relative value of the weight of the constant term respect to the remaining weights. The results for the angular <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> of the LEDs previously mentioned are shown in this work. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
