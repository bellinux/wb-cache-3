30|$|This number also {{indicates}} {{how many times}} the swing leg swings until it lands in each step [8]. Each leg is allowed to swing for T_b/ 2 during each step. The <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> is obtained if the swing leg lands on the ground, T_l/ 2 after it has started to swing. Therefore, the condition for the <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> is T_b/ 2 = T_l/ 2, or r_p = 1. When r_p = 2, T_b/ 2 is equal to T_l. In this case, the stride becomes zero because T_l is the period of full leg swing, {{which means that the}} swing leg lands on the ground at the same place as it is lifted up. When r_p = 3, T_b/ 2 is equal to (1 + 1 / 2) T_l, which indicates that the swing leg swings one full forward swing, one full backward swing, and one more full forward swing. This period ratio also maximizes the stride but it has unnecessary leg swings, compared to the gait for r_p = 1. Similarly, any odd integer numbers of r_p can realize the maximum step length, but as r_p becomes larger, the gait contains more unnecessary leg swings. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} period ratio of 1 realizes the ideal walking.|$|E

40|$|Power law scaling is {{observed}} in many physical, biological and socio-economical complex systems {{and is now}} considered as an important property of these systems. In general, power law exists in {{the central part of}} the distribution. It has deviations from power law for very small and very <b>large</b> <b>step</b> sizes. Tsallis, through non-extensive thermodynamics, explained power law distribution in many cases including deviation from the power law, both for small and very <b>large</b> <b>steps.</b> In case of very <b>large</b> <b>steps,</b> they used heuristic crossover approach. In real systems, the size is limited and thus, the size limiting factor is important. In the present work, we present an alternative model in which we consider that the entropy factor q decreases with step size due to the softening of long range interactions or memory. This explains the deviation of power law for very <b>large</b> <b>step</b> sizes. Finally, we apply this model for distribution of citation index of scientists and examination scores and are able to explain the entire distribution including deviations from power law.

40|$|Stereo {{particle}} image velocimetry {{measurements were}} performed downstream of a forward-facing {{step in a}} stationary-crossflow dominated flow. Three different step heights were studied with the same leading-edge roughness configuration {{to determine the effect}} of the step on the evolution of the stationary-crossflow. Above the critical step height, which is approximately 68 % of the boundary-layer thickness at the step, the step caused {{a significant increase in the}} growth of the stationary crossflow. For the <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> height studied (68 %), premature transition occurred shortly downstream of the step. The stationary crossflow amplitude only reached approximately 7 % of U(sub e) in this case, which suggests that transition does not occur via the high-frequency secondary instabilities typically associated with stationary crossflow transition. The next <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> of 60 % delta still caused a significant impact on the growth of the stationary crossflow downstream of the step, but the amplitude eventually returned to that of the baseline case, and the transition front remained the same. The smallest step height (56 %) only caused a small increase in the stationary crossflow amplitude and no change in the transition front. A final case was studied in which the roughness on the leading edge of the model was enhanced for the lowest step height case to determine the impact of the stationary crossflow amplitude on transition. The stationary crossflow amplitude was increased by approximately four times, which resulted in premature transition for this step height. However, some notable differences were observed in the behavior of the stationary crossflow mode, which indicate that the interaction mechanism which results in the increased growth of the stationary crossflow downstream of the step may be different in this case compared to the larger step heights...|$|E

To this end, a lower iteration bound is derived such that for all parameters from a compact set a solution with a specified level of subop-timality will be obtained.

In order to determine it, we in-vestigate both the computation of the worst case minimal Euclidean distance between an initial iterate and a Lagrange multiplier and the issue of finding the <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> size for the fast gradient method. In addition, we argue that optimal preconditioning of the dual problem cannot be proven to decrease the smallest lower iteration bound.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we prove large {{deviations}} results for partial sums constructed from {{the solution to}} a stochastic recurrence equation. We assume Kesten’s condition [17] under which {{the solution of the}} stochastic recurrence equation has a marginal distribution with power law tails, while the noise sequence of the equations can have light tails. The results of the paper are analogs of those obtained by A. V. and S. V. Nagaev [21, 22] in the case of partial sums of iid random variables. In the latter case, the large deviation probabilities of the partial sums are essentially determined by the <b>largest</b> <b>step</b> size of the partial sum. For the solution to a stochastic recurrence equation, the magnitude of the large deviation probabilities is again given by the tail of the maximum summand, but the exact asymptotic tail behavior is also influenced by clusters of extreme values, due to dependencies in the sequence. We apply the large deviation results to study the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probabilities in the model. (1. 1...|$|E
