5|$|Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine: The {{princess of}} Agrabah, who {{is tired of}} life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition, and had to adjust (or lower) her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the character. Jasmine's supervising {{animator}} was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga provides Jasmine's singing voice.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph {{seemed to be the}} answer the Devils were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> goal, however the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>In</b> Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E

25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores.

Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E

25|$|Although Weinstone {{had been}} removed from America to break up an {{incipient}} factional war, he continued to campaign for the position of party leader. In the spring of 1933 he obtained the final test of strength he had been <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>in</b> the form of a dozen meetings of the Comintern's Anglo-American Secretariat in Moscow spread out over 29 days. Throughout April Browder and Weinstone leveled charges and counter-charges against one another, examining the Communist Party's activities in the United States in fine detail. Despite significant criticism of certain of his actions, Browder emerged from the Moscow sessions in a firm position of authority. Weinstone, accepting defeat at last, remained in Moscow as the CPUSA's CI Rep until 1934.|$|E
25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E
25|$|Mobile {{search is}} {{important}} for the usability of mobile content for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as Netscape. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, Internet web search engines such as Google and AltaVista proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>In</b> an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile media consumption patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.|$|E

Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he can do as an actor, and this is a character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
