5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{the optimal}} duty {{cycle of the}} nodes is {{obtained}} from the theoretical analysis when the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of per bit data successfully received is smallest. Because the data transmitted by a node in a cycle is constant, so the duty cycle is larger and the required modulation level is lower; conversely, the smaller the duty cycle, the higher the modulation level required. And the duty cycle and modulation level is related to <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> Therefore, in this paper, the optimized duty cycle is obtained theoretically which can make the <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> per bit transmission.|$|R
