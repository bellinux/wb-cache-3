25|$|The 1912 Automne exhibition, held in Paris at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées from 1 October to 8 November {{resulted}} in a xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel in the National Assembly (France). The group of artists now recognized as Cubists, among which several non-French citizens exhibited, were regrouped into the same room: Salle XI. The Cubist room was packed full with spectators, as others waited in <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in, recalled Albert Gleizes. The resistance to both foreigners and avant-garde art {{was part of a}} more profound crises: that of defining modern French art in the wake of Impressionism centered in Paris. Placed into question was the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of aesthetics quickly turned political during the Cubist exhibition. The critic Louis Vauxcelles (in Les Arts..., 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des députés and was debated at the French National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{track on}} the eastern bank of Hancock Brook was built in 1850, to complete the Hartford,Provence and Fishkill railroad. Construction of the new railroad line began in 1907, because of treacherous turns and a tragic grade at the pequabuck section of Plymouth, CT. The main focus was the Sullivan hill tunnel, while the remaining sections of the line in Hancock where straightened. In 1940, one track {{was removed from the}} original double track, and the other was moved to the middle, This included abandoning the railroad bridge on Hancock Dam, where two great peninsulas remain. The line was also moved {{out of the way of}} greystone pond, and relocated to the other side. The last passenger train to be operated in the area was in January 1960. This specific area was well known for the amount of hermits that used the <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from Bristol, CT to Waterbury, Connecticut, one of these hermits was known as a hero, for spotting a boulder that rolled off of lionhead mountain, the hermit ran to the nearest train station in Greystone, and warned the man at the office- he was known as a hero of Plymouth, CT and was rewarded a lifetime of food and water, supplied by the town.|$|E

During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball before Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.|$|E

Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode.

George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people would let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E
