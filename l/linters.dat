2500|$|Military rifle {{propellant}} was {{manufactured in}} batches in a procedure taking {{about two weeks}} from treating cotton <b>linters</b> with nitric acid, through curing the extruded grains to evaporate excess ether and alcohol, and finally coating the dried grains with DNT and graphite. Each batch had somewhat different reaction rates, so testing was required to determine the appropriate charge to generate required reaction pressure in the intended cartridge. Test results were forwarded to the factory or arsenal assembling cartridges. Propellants packaged in small sheet metal canisters for sale to civilians were labeled Military Rifle Powder to distinguish the product from low-density [...] "bulk" [...] propellants intended to react at lower pressures in shotguns or pistols and from Sporting Rifle Powder for early lever action rifles unable to withstand the pressures of 20th-century service rifle cartridges. Charges of low-density [...] "bulk" [...] propellants were often similar to the volumes of gunpowder used in older firearms and reaction rates were less variable at low pressures appropriate for those cartridges; but each batch of military rifle propellant required a different canister label specifying the batch or lot number with the tested charge weight to generate appropriate reaction pressure in intended cartridges.|$|E

50|$|Another {{source of}} cotton fibre {{comes from the}} cotton ginning process. The seeds remain, {{surrounded}} by short fibres known as <b>linters</b> for their short length and resemblance to lint. <b>Linters</b> are too short for successful use in fabric. <b>Linters</b> removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts.

40|$|Biodegradable {{compounds}} of poly(&# 949;-caprolactone) (PCL) / cotton <b>linter</b> were melting {{mixed with}} filling content ranging from 1 % to 5 % w/w. Cotton <b>linter</b> {{is an important}} byproduct of textile industry; in this work it was used in raw state and after acid hydrolysis. According {{to the results of}} torque rheometry no decaying of viscosity took place during compounding, evidencing absence of breaking down in molecular weight. The thermal stability increased by 20 % as observed in HDT for PCL/cotton nanolinter compounds. Adding cotton <b>linter</b> to PCL didn't change its crystalline character as showed by XRD; however an increase in degree of crystallinity was observed by means of DSC. From mechanical tests in tension was observed an increase in ductility of PCL, and from mechanical tests in flexion an increase in elastic modulus upon addition of cotton <b>linter,</b> whereas impact strength presented lower values for PCL/cotton <b>linter</b> and PCL/cotton nanolinter compounds. SEM images showed that PCL presents plastic fracture and cotton <b>linter</b> has an interlacing fibril structure with high L/D ratio, which are in agreement with matrix/fibril morphology observed for PCL/cotton <b>linter</b> compounds. PCL/cotton <b>linter</b> compounds made in this work cost less than neat PCL matrix and presented improved properties making feasible its commercial use...|$|R

50|$|On September 26, 1918, the {{government}} made {{a contract with}} Hartsville Oil Mill, a cottonseed producer, which was replicated with several other cottonseed producers for the delivery of cotton <b>linters.</b> Cotton <b>linters,</b> a by-product of the cotton crushing process, were used by {{the government}} in World War I for the production of explosives. Of the production of 2,250,000 pounds, 270,000 bales were on hand and inspected when armistice was declared in late 1918. At this time the government informed the producers that it intended to cancel the contract and would only accept 150,000 bales if the producers agreed to a contract modification. Faced with this repudiation of the contract, the producers agreed to the modification and sought recovery by petition to the U.S. Senate under Judicial Code § 145, the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. § 1492.|$|E

50|$|Cotton paper, {{also known}} as rag paper, is made using cotton <b>linters</b> or cotton from used cloth (rags) as the primary material. Important {{documents}} are often printed on cotton paper, because it is known to last many years without deterioration. Cotton paper is superior in both strength and durability to wood pulp-based paper, which may contain high concentrations of acids, and also absorbs ink or toner better. Different grades of cotton paper can be produced.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{coverings}} of the cottonseed, {{known as}} cottonseed hulls, {{are removed from}} the cotton kernels before the oil is extracted. Cottonseed hulls serve as {{an excellent source of}} feed for the livestock as they contain about 8% of cotton <b>linters</b> which have nearly 100% cellulose in them. They require no grinding and easily mix with other feed sources. As they are easy to handle, their transportation cost is fairly low, as well. Whole cottonseed is another feed product of cottonseed used to feed livestock. It is the seed left after the separation of long fibres from cotton, and serves as a good source of cellulose for ruminants. Whole cottonseed leads to high production of milk and fat, if it is being fed to a high-producing dairy cow. It can be cost effective and provides nutrients such as high protein value of about 23%, crude fibre value of 25%, and high energy value of 20%. Whole cottonseed serves as a highly digestible feed which also improves the reproductive performance in livestock. Pima cottonseed, which is free of <b>linters</b> by default, and delinted cottonseed are other types of cottonseed feed products.|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{was first}} used {{with a mixture of}} silk to make paper called Carta Bombycina. In the 1800s, fiber crops such as flax fibres or cotton from used cloths (rags) were the primary {{material}} source. By the turn of the 20th century, most paper was made from wood pulp, but cotton is still used in specialty papers. As cotton rags now often contain synthetic fibres, papermakers have turned to second-cut cotton <b>linters</b> as raw material sources for making pulp for cotton papers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>Linter</b> {{dates back to}} 1980. The system has {{domestic}} predecessors whose developers later took direct part {{in the creation of}} <b>Linter.</b> By 1983, according to a state order, the Voronezh construction design office [...] "Systemprogramm" [...] had successfully completed the relational DBMS [...] "BARS" [...] under the real-time operating system [...] "RAFOS" [...] (RT-11 prototype) for computers of the SM set. Since 1985, the system developers accepted the mobility, compatibility and openness concept. As a result, DBMS [...] "INTEREAL" [...] was implemented. The system covered a wide spectrum of hardware and software platforms, from [...] "Electronika-85" [...] and Intel 8086 control modules to SM1702 and [...] "Electronika-82" [...] computer complexes and their VAX prototypes. In 1990, the DBMS development team founded the research-and-production company [...] "RELEX" [...] ("Relational Expert Systems"). At this time DBMS <b>Linter</b> was launched. In the late 1990s, Linter-VS 6.0 was developed as part of a project performed by RELEX for the Russian Ministry of Defense. The prototype of the system was <b>Linter</b> 5.7 (1999) developed by RELEX. Linter-VS 6.0 is available only for OS MSVS (mobile system of the armed forces). There also exists Linter-VS 6.0.1 developed in VNIINS based on PostgreSQL 7.2 This system is also available for OS MSVS.RelX Embedded, a compact American/Japanese-developed version of <b>Linter</b> is implemented in Sony products, including a <b>Linter</b> phone (Sony Ericsson SO903i), as well as a Kenwood Navigation System ("HDDSmá:tNavi Emotional Sound" [...] HDV-990 and HDV-790).|$|R

50|$|Purified {{cellulose}} {{from wood}} pulp or cotton <b>linters</b> {{is mixed with}} glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and a catalyst. The mixture is aged 20 hours during which partial hydrolysis occurs and acid resin precipitates as flakes. These are dissolved in acetone and the solution is purified by filtering. The solution is extruded by spinning in a column of warm air. Solvent is recovered. Filaments are stretched and wound onto beams, cones, or bobbins ready for use. Filaments are finally spun into fiber.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{played a}} big role in the {{establishment}} of the town. First planted in the Choctaw Nation in 1825, by 1907 nearly 25% of Oklahoma's cultivated acreage was planted in cotton. Hundreds of cotton gins processed the lint into five-hundred-pound bales and separated the seed from the fiber. Compressing plants pressed and stored bales, textile plants processed the fiber, and cottonseed oil mills crushed seeds, using the residue oil for food products, the <b>linters</b> to make paper, the hulls to mix with livestock feeds, and the cake and meal to feed animals.|$|E
