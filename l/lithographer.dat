5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1844, Thayer left the {{lithography}} business {{and was replaced by}} John Bufford, a <b>lithographer</b> who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford <b>Lithographer.</b> By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford <b>Lithographer</b> so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of {{the fall of}} 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford <b>Lithographer.</b> Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle.

5|$|After 1805, the {{exploits}} of 40,000French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish <b>lithographer</b> created {{an image of the}} battle, which was later expanded by English <b>lithographer</b> John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.|$|E

5|$|William and Stephen Bradshaw Ives {{dissolved}} their partnership on April 24, 1854. William {{then put}} {{most of his}} time managing his newspaper, The Salem Observer. Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a fancy goods importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion Of Happiness print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the copyright, the Ives family chose <b>lithographer</b> F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion Of Happiness in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new litho stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained. In addition to continue publishing The Mansion of Happiness, H. P. Ives and A. A. Weeks published at least two new games: Experts and Tournament & Knighthood.|$|E
