2500|$|Suppose B {{is married}} without {{children}} {{at the time of}} the devise. [...] Suppose further that B's wife were to die or B were to divorce.

On the contrary, the class of [...] "A's issue" [...] is subject to expand long after A's death, so their future interest remains that of a vested remainder subject to open, which is within the scope of the rule. [...] B cannot serve as the life in being for A's issue because B was not yet born, i.e., not [...] "a life in being," [...] {{at the time of the}} transfer. [...] Because her death could (as explained above) be more than 21 years after A's death, the result is that the gift to A's issue violates the rule because it is possible that the gift will vest more than 21 years after the end of all <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> at the time the gift was created.|$|E

2500|$|The unborn widow poses {{a similar}} {{seemingly}} silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left [...] "to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue." [...] Because the gift to A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, {{the law will}} consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries {{a woman who was}} not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. [...] B was not a life in being {{at the time of the}} transfer, and the only remaining [...] "validating life" [...] under the rule against perpetuities is A, who has been dead for 25 years by this time. The gift to A's issue does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> at the time of the transfer, the transfer to A's issue is invalid from the start.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{hours later}} by his watch, Thomas Gradman, {{stirring}} in his swivel chair, closed the last drawer of his bureau, and putting into his waistcoat pocket {{a bunch of}} keys so fat that {{they gave him a}} protuberance on the liver side, brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve, took his umbrella, and descended. Thick, short, and buttoned closely into his old frock coat, he walked toward Covent Garden market. He never missed that daily promenade to the Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit. Generations might be born, and hats might change, wars be fought, and Forsytes fade away, but Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and his son had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient things--still he mustn't complain; his health was good considering his time of life, and after fifty-four years in the Law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late, because it was mostly collector's commission on the rents, and with all this conversion of Forsyte property going on, it looked like drying up, and the price of living still so high; but it was no good worrying--"The good God made us all"--as he was in the habit of saying; still, house property in London--he didn't know what Mr. Roger or Mr. James would say if they could see it being sold like this--seemed to show a lack of faith; but Mr. Soames--he worried. Life and <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> and twenty-one years after--beyond that you couldn't go; still, he kept his health wonderfully--and Miss Fleur was a pretty little thing--she was; she'd marry; but lots of people had no children nowadays--he had had his first child at twenty-two; and Mr. Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had his child the same year--gracious Peter! That was back in '69, a long time before old Mr. Jolyon--fine judge of property--had taken his Will away from Mr. James--dear, yes! Those were the days when they were buyin' property right and left, and none of this khaki and fallin' over one another to get out of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon--the old melons, that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into Mr. James' office, and Mr. James had said to him: [...] "Now, Gradman, you're only a shaver--you pay attention, and you'll make your five hundred a year before you've done." [...] And he had, and feared God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night. And, buying a copy of John Bull--not that he approved of it, an extravagant affair--he entered the Tube elevator with his mere brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the earth.|$|E

The canals had by then been transferred to the Bridgewater Navigation Company in 1872, by whom they were sold in 1887 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company.|$|E
