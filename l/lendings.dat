40|$|The mortgage-backed {{securities}} (MBS) market has experienced significant changes {{over the past}} couple of years. Non-agency (“private label”) securities, which are not guaranteed by the government or the government sponsored enterprises, now account for the majority of MBS issued. In this report, we review the rise of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), the relaxation of lending standards, and the implementation of loan mitigation practices. We analyze whether these structural changes have created an environment of understated risk to investors of MBS. We also measure the efficacy of ratings agencies when it comes to assessing market risk rather than credit risk. Our findings imply that even investment grade rated CDOs will experience significant losses if home prices depreciate. We conclude by providing several policy implications of our findings. I.

In {{the case of a}} transition economy like China, it would be appropriate to assume the presence of a significant level of disparity in the cost of funds between State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. For this purpose, a dataset of the provincial deposit rates and the provincial loan rates for the state and the nonstate sectors is built. Even after controlling the national- and province-specific shocks, the correlation between the local deposit rates and the local loan rates for the nonstate sector, in contrast with that for the state sector, is even higher than for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The findings suggest that serious asymmetric information problems between banks and non-SOEs might impede cross-regional lending and prevent the development of the nonstate sector within China. ...|$|R

Since the launch of the single European currency, mutual fiscal performances have been mixed. 	In order to impose fiscal discipline on the Eurozone candidates, the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was implemented in 1997, reflecting a full set of fiscal rules and several monitoring- and correction mechanisms on a supranational level. However, after two rounds of reforms in 2003 - 2005 and 2010 - 2011, scepticism prevails. The latest reforms continue to reflect an unwillingness of member states to transfer the necessary degree of sovereignty over macro-fiscal objectives to the European level mirroring the need of further political integration. 	While these observations helps put the current tensions into perspective, they cannot explain why member states have been showing mixed results while being subjected to the same external constraints. This research will try to seek answers to this question. Where problems occur on a supranational level due to the lack of political integration, there is a need for increased monitoring on a national level. The Economic and Monetary Union of Europe is in essence a two-way relationship. In the end, the increased fiscal imbalances in the euro area as a whole and the current critical situation in some of the member states, risk undermining stability, growth and employment, as well as the sustainability of the EMU itself...|$|R
40|$|THE EFFECTS OF BANK MERGERS ON THE TERMS OF <b>LENDING</b> In {{the last}} decade, Chilean banking {{industry}} has experienced {{significant increases in}} its concentration. For example, in 1990 the market share of the 4 major banks was 49 %. In 2002, this index reached almost 60 %. A relevant cause of this increase was the mergers and acquisitions of institutions that occurred throughout the period. The main objective of this work is to {{study the effects of}} these mergers and acquisitions on bank clients. Particularly, this work analyses changes in credit costs of a sample of Chilean manufacturing firms during the period 1990 - 1998. In the first stage, the effects that changes in market shares of banks effectively lending to each client have on bank clients were identified. Later, the project analyses the effect of mergers and acquisitions through a comparison of the change in conditions for the loans paid by firms that have directly experienced a merger (that is, {{at least one of the}} banks that granted them loans was merged) to the change in conditions of firms that did not experience a merger in the corresponding period. Results show that the effects that changes in market share have on clients are heterogeneous, and that the sign and magnitude of these effects are essentially dependant on whether the company has a diversified source of bank loans when the concentration change occurs. Particularly, firms that experience a greater deterioration on the terms of their loans are those that maintain loans with only one bank. This result suggests that the banking market is characterized by the capture of its clients, possibly as a result of information monopolies or other costs of change. Eventual profits in efficiency caused by increases in concentration are only shared with firms that have debts with various banks and experience drops in credit cost.

So she shook awhile with laughter; and then the mirth abated but not the shaking; and a grue took hold upon her flesh, and the cold of the grave upon her belly, and the terror of death upon her soul.

40|$|Essay one. For banks, good governances {{can reduce}} both the {{abilities}} and incentives of insiders to expropriate bank resources and promote bank efficiency, and {{are supposed to}} have real economic effect on their customers and firms in that country. This study examines how banking sector's ownership structure is related to the firm-level investment efficiency on a sample of 88, 764 firm-year observations across 36 developed and developing countries between 1995 and 2006. I find that, ceteris paribus, a country's banking sector with more cash flow rights by controlling owners improves firms' investment efficiency; whereas, a country's banking sector with larger divergence between cash flow rights and control rights by controlling owners reduces firms' investment efficiency. In addition, I find that the relation between a country's banking sector ownership structure and firms' investment efficiency is stronger for low growth firms, suggesting banks' stronger debt monitoring role on firms with free cash flow problem. Besides, banks have more influence on investment efficiency of firms, which rely on more external financing. Finally, the relation between banking sector's ownership structure and firms' investment efficiency is more pronounced in countries with stronger private monitoring for banks and better information environment of banks. On the whole, the results suggest that banking sector's ownership structure is an important instrument to govern banks' operation with regard to efficient lending and sound governances on firms' investment decision. Essay two. In this study, we examine whether and how incentives in bank lending, in emerging market like China, influence firms' investment behaviors, the key determinant of firms' productivity. First, being connected with bureaucrats provides firms with a comparative non-economic advantage of access to debt in China. Our empirical results show that loans granting to political connected firms is less sensitive to those firms' profitability, which is consistent with "rent-seeking" hypothesis. Second, political connection is a violated factor in debt markets and politically connected lending is accompanied by less monitoring posted by banks. Consequently, we find that firms with political tie invest less efficiently than firms without political tie when they can access to abnormal debt through political tie. Moreover, the negative relation between politically connected lending and firms' investment efficiency is stronger for SOE firms and low growth firms. Finally, we find that region development with regard to financial development and government quality improvement reduces politically connected <b>lending's</b> negative impact on firms' investment efficiency. In sum, soft lending, like politically connected lending, destroy economic growth because of misallocation of scary resources among firms and also because of less incentive to monitor firms' project selection. essay 1.

40|$|Tezin basılısı İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi Kütüphanesi'ndedir. This study {{examines}} {{the place of}} riba in the Late Ottoman Empire. To this end, I will scrutinize the concept of murabaha to demonstrate credit relations among the Ottomans. The scholar approach to this subject overlooks social reflections of riba by focusing only on the judicial or economic side of the concept. Since riba is prohibited in Islam, the Ottomans used legal solutions of Islamic law for transactions which intended to bear interest gain without falling into the ill- doing of riba. These riba-prevention methods were mainly used in charitable ends such as sheltering orphan assets and serving in pious foundations. Credit relations amongst commoners were also regulated under these sharia compliant solutions and an interest rate ceiling was appointed. Hence, the “clean” interest gain from these legal transactions was defined as murabaha in order to differentiate it from riba. My starting point is that why the legal solutions to escape from riba became the tools that usurers employed in the first place. Identifying the actors and the methods help observe the reflections of riba in the socio-economic life. After illustrating the credit market, I conclude {{that there was not}} a special group of usurers such as sarrafs, non-Muslims or merchants. The legal cases regarding usury were examined consecutively. Usury cases generally resulted with the reducing of interests and dividing the debt into instalments. Such cases show that the state took side with the debtors to preserve the social harmony. Since the problem of usury prevailed mainly in the provinces, state-wide measures were taken {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. The state reduced interest rate ceilings and established cash funds to deal with usury. The vanishing of the concern of preventing riba and the negative connotation the concept gained in usurious cases made murabaha to signify the usury.

Insofar as existing accounts assume that the financialization of consumption occurs in contexts marked by wage stagnation and a general deterioration of the middle classes, they engender two contradictory explanations: while political economists argue that people use credit in order to smooth their consumption {{in the face of}} market volatility, economists maintain that concentration of wealth at the top pushes middle income consumers to emulate the expenditures of the rich and consume beyond their means. These explanations do not necessarily fit the reality of developing countries. Triangulating in-depth interviews with middle class families, multivariate statistical analysis and secondary literature, the project shows that consumers in Chile use credit to finance “ordinary” forms of consumption that do not aim either at coping with market instability or emulating and signaling status to others. Rather, Chileans use department store credit cards in order to acquire a standard package of “inconspicuous” goods that they feel entitled to have. From this point of view, the systematic indebtedness of consumers originates in a major concern with “rank”, “achievement” and "security" that – following De Botton [...] I call “status anxiety”. Status anxiety does not stem from the desire to emulate rich consumers, but from the impossibility of complying with normative expectations about what a middle class family should be (and have) that outweigh wage improvements. The project thus investigates the way in which “status anxiety” is systematically reproduced by means of two broad mechanisms that prompt people to acquire consumer debt. The first mechanism generating debt stems from an increase of real wages and high levels of inequality. It is explained by a general sociological principle known as relative deprivation, which points to the fact that general satisfaction with one´s income, possessions or status, is assessed not in absolute terms such as total income, but in relation with reference groups. In this sense, I explore the mechanisms that operate as catalyzers of relative deprivation, by making explicit social inequalities and distorting the perception of others´ wealth. Despite upward mobility and economic improvement, Chileans share the perception of “falling behind,” which materializes in an “imaginary middle class” against which people compare their status, possessions and economic independence. Finally, I show that the commodification of education, health and pension funds does not directly prompt people to acquire consumer debt, but operate as “income draining” mechanisms that demand higher shares of middle class families’ “discretionary income. ” In combination with “relative deprivation,” these “income draining” mechanisms leave families with few options to perform their desired class identities, other than learning how to bring resources from the future into the present with the help of department store credit cards.

Down a cross road on an English plain, a cathedral city {{outlined}} on the horizon, a hazel shaw upon the left, comes Madam Wanton dancing with her fair enchanted cup, and Faithful, book in hand, half pauses. The cut is perfect as a symbol; the giddy movement of the sorceress, the uncertain poise of the man struck to the heart by a temptation, the contrast of that even plain of life whereon he journeys with the bold, ideal bearing of the wanton--the artist who invented and portrayed this had not merely read Bunyan, he had also thoughtfully lived. The Delectable Mountains--I continue skimming the first part--are not on the whole happily rendered. Once, and once only, the note is struck, when Christian and Hopeful are seen coming, shoulder-high, through a thicket of green shrubs--box, perhaps, or perfumed nutmeg; while behind them, domed or pointed, the hills stand ranged against the sky. A little further, and we come to that masterpiece of Bunyan's insight into life, the Enchanted Ground; where, in a few traits, he has set down the latter end of such a number of the would-be good; where his allegory goes so deep that, to people looking seriously on life, it cuts like satire. The true significance of this invention lies, of course, far out of the way of drawing; only one feature, the great tedium of the land, the growing weariness in welldoing, may be somewhat represented in a symbol. The pilgrims are near the end: [...] "Two Miles Yet," [...] says the legend. The road goes ploughing up and down over a rolling heath; the wayfarers, with outstretched arms, are already sunk to the knees over the brow of the nearest hill; they have just passed a milestone with the cipher two; from overhead a great, piled, summer cumulus, as of a slumberous summer afternoon, beshadows them: two miles! it might be hundreds. In dealing with the Land of Beulah the artist lags, in both parts, miserably behind the text, but in the distant prospect of the Celestial City more than regains his own. You will remember when Christian and Hopeful [...] "with desire fell sick." [...] "Effect of the Sunbeams" [...] is the artist's title. Against the sky, upon a cliffy mountain, the radiant temple beams upon them over deep, subjacent woods; they, behind a mound, as if seeking shelter from the splendour--one prostrate on his face, one kneeling, and with hands ecstatically lifted--yearn with passion after that immortal city. Turn the page, and we behold them walking by the very shores of death; Heaven, from this nigher view, has risen half-way to the zenith, and sheds a wider glory; and the two pilgrims, dark against that brightness, walk and sing out of the fulness of their hearts. No cut more thoroughly illustrates at once the merit and the weakness of the artist. Each pilgrim sings with a book in his grasp--a family Bible at the least for bigness; tomes so recklessly enormous that our second impulse is to laughter. And yet that is not the first thought, nor perhaps the last. Something in the attitude of the manikins--faces they have none, they are too small for that--something in the way they swing these monstrous volumes to their singing, something perhaps borrowed from the text, some subtle differentiation from the cut that went before and the cut that follows after--something, at least, speaks clearly of a fearful joy, of Heaven seen from the deathbed, of the horror of the last passage no less than of the glorious coming home. There is that in the action of one of them which always reminds me, with a difference, of that haunting last glimpse of Thomas Idle, travelling to Tyburn in the cart. Next come the Shining Ones, wooden and trivial enough; the pilgrims pass into the river; the blot already mentioned settles over and obliterates Christian. In two more cuts we behold them drawing nearer to the other shore; and then, between two radiant angels, one of whom points upward, we see them mounting in new weeds, their former <b>lendings</b> left behind them on the inky river. More angels meet them; Heaven is displayed, and if no better, certainly no worse, than it has been shown by others--a place, at least, infinitely populous and glorious with light--a place that haunts solemnly the hearts of children. And then this symbolic draughtsman once more strikes into his proper vein. Three cuts conclude the first part. In the first the gates close, black against the glory struggling from within. The second shows us Ignorance--alas! poor Arminian!--hailing, in a sad twilight, the ferryman Vain-Hope; and in the third we behold him, bound hand and foot, and black already with the hue of his eternal fate, carried high over the mountain-tops of the world by two angels of the anger of the Lord.
