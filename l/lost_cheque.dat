She dreamed that it was lying {{at the root of}} a certain tree, where she found it next day, and her theory is {{the same as that of}} Mr. A., the owner of the <b>lost</b> <b>cheque.</b> {11c} ...|$|E

50|$|Some purchasers {{have found}} the process of filing a claim for <b>lost</b> or stolen <b>cheques</b> is cumbersome, and have been left without {{recourse}} after their <b>cheques</b> were <b>lost</b> or stolen.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Soames {{stated that}} he had <b>lost</b> the <b>cheque</b> with a pocket-book; that he had {{certainly}} lost it on the day on which he had called on Mr. Crawley at Hogglestock; and that he missed his pocket-book on his journey back from Hogglestock to Barchester. At the moment of missing it he remembered {{that he had taken}} the book out from his pocket in Mr. Crawley's room, and, at that moment, he had not doubted but that he had left it in Mr. Crawley's house. He had written and sent to Mr. Crawley to inquire, but had been assured that nothing had been found. There had been no other property of value in the pocket-book,--nothing but a few visiting cards and a memorandum, and he had therefore stopped the cheque at the London bank, and thought no more about it.|$|R
50|$|Cashier's cheques and banker's drafts, {{also known}} as bank cheques, banker's cheques or treasurer's cheques, are cheques issued against the funds of a {{financial}} institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term cashier's check {{is used in the}} US and banker's draft is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. Cashier's cheques are perceived {{to be as good as}} cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A <b>lost</b> or stolen <b>cheque</b> can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} temptation of Mrs. Poynsett's cheque, suggested, perhaps in jest, by Vivian, but growing on them as the {{feasibility}} of using it became clear. It was so easy {{to make it appear}} to Archie Douglas that the letter was simply an inquiry for the lost one. Mr. Proudfoot, the father, was out of reach; Mrs. Poynsett would continue to think the <b>cheque</b> <b>lost</b> in the post; and Tom Vivian undertook to get it presented for payment through persons who would guard against its being tracked. The sum exceeded the debt, but he would return the overplus to them, and they both cherished the hope of returning it with interest. Indeed, it had been but a half consent on the part of either, elicited only by the dire alternative of exposure; the envelope and letter were destroyed, and Vivian carried off the cheque to some of the Jews with whom he had had only too many transactions, and they never met him again.|$|R
