25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E
25|$|Sometime around 9:15 PM, police {{officers}} {{burst into the}} Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> More police burst into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly into the ceiling, and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses said John Pegues, a tavern patron, {{was shot in the}} leg by police at this time, which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM. Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time. The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being pistol-whipped. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.|$|E

500|$|Ezrin {{was intent}} on {{developing}} a cohesive sound for the album, and his earnestness {{was a source of}} humor for the band. [...] At a time when the Beatles had a reputation that made them seem beyond criticism, the Alice Cooper band intended [...] "Second Coming" [...] as a jab at the recently released track [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] with Phil Spector's elaborate production—the hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band {{as if it were the}} Second Coming of a master composer on the order of Beethoven—as well as Ezrin's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper's music. [...] Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense. [...] When recording the [...] "I wanna get out of here" [...] sequence of [...] "Ballad of Dwight Fry", Ezrin had Cooper <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> surrounded by a cage of metal chairs to create an element of realism to the singer's frantic screams.

The company hasn't put forward a strategy to regain control over the situation in the reactors. Helmut Hirsch, a German physicist and nuclear expert, says [...] "they are improvising with tools that were not intended for this type of situation". There are roughly 400 workers onsite risking their lives to prevent the situation from deteriorating even further, who sleep in a building on the plant grounds.

Dante claims that Randal does nothing for him but make his life miserable by getting him fined, {{offending}} his customers, and ruining his relationship. Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame, as Dante, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again {{to go to the}} wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and [...] "overcompensates for having a monkey's job". He claims Dante thinks he is more advanced than the customers and storms off with [...] "if we're so fucking advanced, what are we doing working here?" [...] leaving Dante speechless on the floor.|$|E

60|$|And to {{the various}} {{irregular}} reading of my father I owe the inestimable blessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood except those of Jules Verne. But {{my father used to}} get books for himself and me from the Bromstead Institute, Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid and illustrated histories; one of the Russo-Turkish war and one of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia I read from end to end; Stanley and Livingstone, lives of Wellington, Napoleon and Garibaldi, and back volumes of PUNCH, from which I derived conceptions of foreign and domestic politics it has taken years of adult reflection to correct. And at home permanently we had Wood's NATURAL HISTORY, a brand-new illustrated Green's HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE, Irving's COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS, a great number of unbound parts of some geographical work, a VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I think it was called, with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's NEW TESTAMENT with a map of Palestine, {{and a variety of other}} informing books bought at sales. There was a Sowerby's BOTANY also, with thousands of carefully tinted pictures of British plants, and one or two other important works in the sitting-room. I was allowed to turn these over and even <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with them on Sundays and other occasions of exceptional cleanliness.|$|E
6000|$|For his lively {{spirits and}} quick fancy could not easily be subdued. He {{would get out}} of his bed-room window at night, walk along a coping, and climb over the roof {{to the top of the}} next house, only for the high purpose of {{astonishing}} a neighbor by dropping a stone down his chimney. As a young school-boy he came upon Hoole's translation of Ariosto, and achieved in his father's back yard knightly adventures. [...] "Robinson Crusoe" [...] and [...] "Sindbad the Sailor" [...] made him yearn to go to sea. But this was impossible unless he could learn to lie hard and eat salt pork, which he detested. He {{would get out of}} bed at night and <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> for an hour or two by way of practice. He also took every opportunity that came in his way of eating the detested food. But the more he tried to like it the nastier it grew, and he gave up as impracticable his hope of going to sea. He fastened upon adventures of real travelers; he yearned for travel, and was entranced in his youth by first sight of the beauties of the Hudson River. He scribbled jests for his school friends, and, of course, he wrote a school-boy play. At sixteen his schooling was at an end, and he was placed in a lawyer's office, from which he was transferred to another, and then, in January, 1802, to another, where he continued his clerkship with a Mr. Hoffman, who had a young wife, and two young daughters by a former marriage. With this family Washington Irving, a careless student, lively, clever, kind, established the happiest relations, of which afterwards there came the deep grief of his life and a sacred memory.|$|E

It seems that they ill-used him so atrociously that, at last, his {{firmness}} gave way, and he did let out some information. Poor soul, the flesh is weak, you know. What it was he did not tell me. There was a crushed spirit in that mangled body. Nothing I found to say could make him whole. When they let him out, he crept into that hole, and bore his remorse stoically. He would not go near anyone he knew. I would have sought assistance for him, but, indeed, where could I have gone looking for it? Where was I to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any power to help? The people living round us were all starving and drunken. They were the victims of the Ministry of Finances. Don't ask me how we lived. I couldn't tell you. It was like a miracle of wretchedness. I had nothing to sell, and I assure you my clothes were in such a state that it was impossible for me {{to go out in the}} daytime. I was indecent. I had to wait till it was dark before I ventured into the streets to beg for a crust of bread, or whatever I could get, to keep him and me alive. Often I got nothing, and then I would crawl back and <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> by the side of his couch. Oh yes, I can sleep quite soundly on bare boards.

Couldn't bear it; ran away at fifteen, and have never heard a word from home since. What happened? I came here, worked, saved, bought land, cattle; married a wife, lived as I liked to live--am happy. There's my wife--mother of six children--you have seen her yourself, a woman for a man to be proud of. No ding-donging, black looks, scouring from Monday to Saturday--you couldn't eat your dinner off my kitchen floor.
