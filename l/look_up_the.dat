5|$|Ramagya Prashna (रामाज्ञा प्रश्न), {{literally}} Querying the Will of Rama, is an Awadhi work {{related to}} both Ramayana and Jyotisha (astrology). It consists of seven Kands or books, {{each of which}} is divided into seven Saptakas or Septets of seven Dohas each. Thus it contains 343 Dohas in all. The work narrates the Ramayana non-sequentially, and gives a method to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Shakuna (omen or portent) for astrological predictions.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
25|$|Equation 9 is more {{commonly}} used due to the simplicity of only having to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> standard chemical exergy for given substances.

Note the quotient (omitting fractions). Enter {{the table with}} the Julian year, and just before the final division add 50 and subtract the quotient noted above.|$|E
25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator or <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone number. An {{example of this}} was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to search through the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E

Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E

25|$|The Memorial park {{is a small}} keyhole shaped area {{located on}} the aptly named 'Canadalaan' on the {{southwest}} fringe of Passendale village. Fittingly, maple trees and a hedge of holly line {{the edges of the}} park and well kept lawns and stone pathways surround the low circular flagstone terrace that the granite memorial block rests on. From the centre of the memorial grounds one can <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Canadalaan to see the rebuilt church of Passendale and in the opposite direction, down a long avenue of trees, the rebuilt spires of Ypres.|$|E
25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. <b>Look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This {{was achieved by}} creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{computers}} use {{a variety}} of techniques. One common method, especially on higher-end processors with floating point units, is to combine a polynomial or rational approximation (such as Chebyshev approximation, best uniform approximation, and Padé approximation, and typically for higher or variable precisions, Taylor and Laurent series) with range reduction and a table lookup—they first <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Devices that lack hardware multipliers often use an algorithm called CORDIC (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, bitshift, and table lookup. These methods are commonly implemented in hardware floating-point units for performance reasons.|$|E
25|$|The Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg {{conjecture}} concerns implicit graphs {{given as}} a set of labeled vertices with a black-box rule for determining whether any two vertices are adjacent. This definition differs from an adjacency labeling scheme in that the rule may be specific to a particular graph rather than being a generic rule that applies to all graphs in a family. Because of this difference, every graph has an implicit representation. For instance, the rule could be to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pair of vertices in a separate adjacency matrix. However, an algorithm that is given as input an implicit graph of this type must operate on it only through the implicit adjacency test, without reference to how the test is implemented.|$|E
25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E

25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

500|$|By this time, Pickingill was {{increasingly}} inflating his age, eventually {{claiming that he}} was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it. The journalist subsequently wrote {{an article about the}} alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was [...] "Frederick Pickingale"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would be able to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> parish records and discover his real age.|$|E
