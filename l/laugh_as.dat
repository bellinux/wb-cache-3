25|$|As Marvel's G.I. Joe {{series is}} {{drawing to a}} close, Snake Eyes and Cobra Commander finally battle each other in issue #150. Snake Eyes {{eventually}} wins against an armored Cobra Commander, but the Commander would have the last <b>laugh,</b> <b>as</b> he captures Storm Shadow and successfully brainwashes {{him back to the}} allegiance of Cobra. Snake Eyes and Scarlett would continue to serve G.I. Joe until its disbandment.|$|E
25|$|Winfrey and King joined 60 {{women for}} a spa getaway in 2006. They spent five days at Miraval Life in Balance Resort and Spa {{taking part in}} self-improvement {{exercise}}s. For an exercise called A Swing and a Prayer, the women were hoisted 40 {{feet in the air}} and told to let go. Once in the air, King—who is afraid of heights—wouldn't let herself fall. Winfrey couldn't help but <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> King remained in the air but eventually persuaded her to let go.|$|E
25|$|Chicago {{would take}} in {{the lead in the}} third quarter with Cutler's 7-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Johnny Knox, followed by kicker Robbie Gould's 37-yard field goal. The Seahawks would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal. However, the Bears got the last <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> Cutler hooked up with wide receiver Devin Hester on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett). Seattle tried to rally, but Chicago's defense held on for the win.|$|E

25|$|As Marvel's G.I. Joe series {{drew to a}} close, Cobra Commander and Snake Eyes finally battled {{each other}} in issue #150. Snake Eyes {{eventually}} won against an armored Cobra Commander, but the Commander would have the last <b>laugh,</b> <b>as</b> he captured Storm Shadow and successfully brainwashed {{him back to the}} allegiance of Cobra. Shortly afterward, Cobra forces in Europe fell to a unified attack by regular military forces. In the wake of this conflict, most of Cobra's high command disappeared, and Cobra Commander himself became an international fugitive. Soon after, the military disbanded the G.I. Joe team.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last <b>laugh,</b> <b>as</b> he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E
500|$|Released in 2007, Saawariya saw Kapoor play a Muslim woman {{awaiting}} {{the return of}} her lover opposite Mukerji and Ranbir Kapoor. It was the first Indian feature film produced by a Hollywood studio, Sony Pictures Entertainment. Saawariya {{proved to be a}} major critical and commercial failure. Writing for BBC, Jaspreet Pandohar called the film a [...] "misfire on a massive scale". Raja Sen of Rediff.com described her <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> [...] "almost as infectious as her father's", but wished that she had been [...] "allowed to simper softly, instead of having a clearly overdubbed plastic giggle plastered onto her." [...] The film earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut nomination and the Stardust Award for Superstar of Tomorrow– Female.|$|E

500|$|After dismissing a {{few more}} {{questions}} as [...] "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he [...] "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb [...] "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; {{he spoke in a}} casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said [...] "I don't remember." [...] Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> he replied, [...] "I don't remember. Somewhere." [...] When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.|$|E
500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do you think I am, crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+ {{and said that}} it [...] "isn't typically as heavy on the usual stock jokes that weigh the show down, and the adventures of Brian and Stewie drive more interest than most other characters." [...] Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 rating and called the episode and its sister episode, [...] "No Country Club for Old Men", [...] "a perfect representation of the wild extremes of this season." [...] He added [...] "it wasn't the funniest episode, but the way the parallel stories worked and intertwined was at least extremely interesting, lacking much of the lazy humor that at times plagued this season. Mark Trammell of TV Equals said [...] "All in all, an okay episode that benefited from the combination approach, but MacFarlane might want to retire both the time travel stuff and the [...] "road picture"-approach after this one, as the well is clearly running dry [...] To tell the truth, I didn't <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> much as I wanted to".|$|E

500|$|Comics writer Paul Gravett chose {{it as one}} of {{the best}} comics of Japan in 2008, while writers Shaenon Garrity and Jason Thompson elected {{it as one of}} the most wanted titles for {{licensing}} in 2010. Japanese manga critic Kaoru Nagayama has noted that the manga is [...] "fun to read" [...] and commended Arakawa for keeping Jesus and Buddha faithful to their real character—of kindness—even when confronted by evil. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network criticized it for its art and questioned its capacity to evolve into something other than [...] "Jesus and Buddha hanging out, while normal people do embarrassing things to them". Santos complained that Jesus' and Buddha's philosophical differences and personalities are not explored. However, Santos praised the series' comedy, noting its simplicity and saying, [...] "its brilliance comes not from purposely trivializing two of the world's great religions, but by highlighting the quirks of the secular world when these famous religious figures are placed in it". According to him, the series does not lose its capacity of making readers <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> it progresses, unlike other manga. Jolyon Baraka Thomas of The Guardian praised the constancy of [...] "visual gags and puns", and wrote: [...] "Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines, nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 12, 2009, [...] "The Camel" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.67 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, about a five percent drop from the previous week's episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy". The episode received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "The Camel" [...] was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed [...] "each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the [...] "murinal" [...] scene involving Jerry {{and the fact that}} no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on [...] "the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "The Camel" [...] one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot [...] "made me <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> hard as I have in a very long time", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet and ridiculous moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga and anime have {{commented on}} Hiruma's character. Chris Beveridge from Mania.com stated that [...] "the outlandish nature of Hiruma with his guns blazing gets old very quickly" [...] and {{considered it a}} [...] "downside" [...] to the series. On the other hand, Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green said that [...] "impish Hiruma starts out as a unique star." [...] Mania.com's Jarred Pine noted that Hiruma is [...] "so completely over-the-top and out of left field that I couldn't help laughing" [...] and that his [...] "rude, crude, and completely unpredictable" [...] behavior [...] "makes his character so damn enjoyable". Pine concluded that Hiruma's personality was [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and his [...] "unpredictable nature" [...] was responsible for making the story [...] "so enjoyable". The contrast with [...] "Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature" [...] was also praised by Pine. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos praised Hiruma's character design as [...] "imaginative" [...] with his [...] "lanky" [...] and [...] "demon-like appearance" [...] and additionally commented that [...] "despite his sheer ruthlessness, it's hard not to <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> Hiruma enthusiastically resorts to blackmail in recruiting students for the team". Erin Finnegan of ANN also noted the [...] "demonic-looking" [...] aspect of Hiruma, saying he is [...] "like a predecessor of Ozu from The Tatami Galaxy with a love of football". ANN's Zac Bertschy called Hiruma the [...] "most fun" [...] character insofar, making note of his [...] "brash, menacing and ultimately passionate" [...] personality and that [...] "in a sense, Hiruma turns the 'kindly old coach-come-mentor who helps the hero along' cliché on its ear". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post considered Hiruma [...] "the most memorable part of the show", saying he is [...] "everyone's favourite and most memorable character". Partly because of his [...] "sheer insanity", demonstrated by his recruiting methods, {{and partly because of}} the fact he gradually shows care and trusts for the team Homer wrote that [...] "he is an instantly memorable character" [...] and [...] "so unique in this show (and any show for that matter)".|$|E

500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work and all he has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last <b>laugh</b> <b>as</b> he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Cardinals would tie {{the game with}} running back Chris [...] "Beanie" [...] Wells getting a 10-yard {{touchdown}} run.
