40|$|Nicosia {{is a city}} {{designed}} to be divided across many false lines. The rich history of the city reveals the remnants of foreign intervention that imprinted a multi-cultural background on Nicosia, which -at the same time- erected some artificial <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation.</b> Britain’s colonial rule was crucial in fostering the most contemporary <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> division. A given constitution in 1960 made these lines look inevitable, and by 1964 Nicosia (like many other towns in Cyprus) was already divided on the ground. Turkey’s military invasion in 1974 imposed an even deeper <b>line</b> <b>of</b> division across Nicosia (and Cyprus) that engendered some novel problems which are visible up until today. EU accession stimulated some hope for overcoming division, which is relatively elusive. (author's abstract...|$|R

50|$|The lack of {{opportunity}} in the South prompted many African Americans to migrate to Western cities in search {{of jobs in the}} booming munitions industry. Once they arrived, they were met with a variety of factors that separated emerging migrant communities from white ones. This urban spatial segregation {{led to the creation of}} racially homogeneous areas in cities that saw large amounts of African American immigration, such as the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles. It is estimated that less than 1% of Los Angeles's 461,000 black residents lived in communities without a black majority in 1960, resulting in de facto segregation. In order to exploit the poor financial situation many migrants were in, areas of low income housing were established in places city planners wanted them to live. For example, South Los Angeles was established as a designated area for African Americans as early as the 1930s. Working class blacks were attracted by the low price of housing intentionally placed in order to encourage the concentration of blacks and Latinos away from whites. Freeways were often built with the isolation of racial communities in mind. They served to reinforce <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> and further contributed to the isolation of racially homogeneous communities in racially diverse cities. The fear of racially motivated violence and discrimination also served to isolate communities of minorities as they sought collective security and nondiscriminatory treatment close to home. The limited amount of housing, combined with the upsurge of immigrants during the Second Great Migration lead to severe overcrowding and housing shortages that contributed to increasingly low property values.|$|R

40|$|The English Language Program (ELP) was {{established}} at a northeastern {{state university in}} 1992 with {{a grant from the}} Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education in response to the University 2 ̆ 7 s growing number of enrolled immigrants, a shortage of English as a Second Language resources, and the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> between ethnic groups. This program pairs native (English Fellow) and non-native English-speaking (English Learner) university students to address the academic discourse needed to help English Learners master course content. Cooperative learning, emphasizing peer education, interdependent cooperation, and non-superficial interaction between outgroup members, provided the theoretical framework for the ELP design. ^ Since assuming the ELP 2 ̆ 7 s financial support in 1995, University efforts to fund the ELP have revolved around its perceived potential for promoting cultural exchange, enhanced understanding, and equal interaction between English Fellows and Learners through shared knowledge and mutual effort. These were only assumptions, however, as cooperative learning research had not addressed these dimensions at the postsecondary level. ^ This qualitative study investigated how participants understood Fellow/Learner cooperation as (a) relationships between persons of equal status (b) and ones enhancing understanding through cultural exchange. A case study approach of six pairs was used; data gathering techniques included interviews, document review, and observation. Data analysis was informed by the theoretical frameworks of the contact hypothesis, cooperative learning, social identity theory, decategorization, and investment. ^ The research questions yielded interrelated data which underscored the role of interpersonal relationships and mutual discourse in promoting understanding and equal status between the Fellows and Learners. The emergence of an interpersonal relationship figured largely in diminishing the salience of the Fellow (helper) /Learner (helpee) distinction through the development of alternative sources of status or positive identity. Relatedly, information gleaned through interpersonal exchange allowed participants to discuss their partners in complex and individuated ways that undermined category-based biases and preconceptions. Additional findings indicated that the development of such interpersonal relationships were associated with the participants 2 ̆ 7 investment in the Fellow/Learner interaction in terms of fashioning personal and professional identities—a process facilitated by the ability to identify with their outgroup partner on an interpersonal level. ...|$|R
40|$|Transgenes from {{transgenic}} oilseed rape, Brassica napus (AACC genome), can introgress into {{populations of}} wild B. rapa (AA genome), but {{little is known}} about the long-term persistence of transgenes from different transformation events. For example, transgenes that are located on the crop’s C chromosomes may be lost during the process of introgression. We investigated the genetic behavior of transgenes in backcross generations of wild B. rapa after nine GFP (green fluorescent protein) -Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) B. napus lines, named GT lines, were hybridized with three wild B. rapa accessions, respectively. Each backcross generation involved crosses between hemizygous GT plants and non-GT B. rapa pollen recipients. In some cases, sample sizes were too small to allow the detection of major deviations from Mendelian segregation ratios, but the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> GT:non-GT was consistent with an expected ratio of 1 : 1 in all crosses in the BC 1 generation. Starting with the BC 2 generation, significantly different genetic behavior of the transgenes was observed among the nine GT B. napus lines. In some <b>lines,</b> the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> GT:non-GT showed a ratio of 1 : 1 in the BC 2, BC 3, and BC 4 generations. However, in other GT B. napus <b>lines</b> the <b>segregation</b> ratio <b>of</b> GT:non-GT significantly deviated from 1 : 1 in the BC 2 and BC 3 generations, which had fewer transgenic progeny than expected, but not in the BC 4 generation. Most importantly, in two GT B. napus <b>lines</b> the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> GT:non-GT did not fit into a ratio of 1 : 1 in the BC 2, BC 3 or BC 4 generations due to a deficiency of transgenic progeny.

40|$|The use {{of barley}} grains as bioreactors for {{high-level}} production of cellulase (1, 4 -b-glucanase) was investigated. A hybrid cellulase gene, cel-hyb 1, {{driven by the}} rice GluB- 1 promoter was expressed specifically in developing endosperm. Codon usage optimisation of celhyb 1 increased its expression in barley grains 527 -fold and led to cellulase production of up to 1. 5 % of total grain protein. CEL-HYB 1 enzyme in barley grains was highly stable during post-harvest storage.

Inequity was so bad that although two thirds of D.C.'s population was black, 92% of public school children were black. Striking statistics such as one out of three ninth grade public school students ending up graduating gave way to rising frustration from the black majority towards the white government and only gave way to louder and louder cries for home rule.
