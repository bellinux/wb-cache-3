It was {{originally}} released on 25 January 1985 on Virgin (UK and Ireland), Atlantic (US and Canada), and WEA (rest of the world). It features guest backing vocalists, including Helen Terry, Peter Gabriel and Sting. Some of the songs, like [...] "Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Number" [...] and [...] "Sussudio", were based around improvisation. Other songs, like [...] "Long Long Way to Go", had a political message. [...] "One More Night", [...] "Sussudio", [...] "Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Number", and [...] "Take Me Home" [...] were released as singles, with corresponding music videos.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC's Newsbeat programme, McVeigh stated that {{due to the nature of}} the band's songwriting techniques clashing with their difficult touring schedules, there will be no new White Lies material until 2010. Despite this, McVeigh has mentioned that the ambitious recording of [...] "Nothing to Give" [...] and [...] "The Price of Love" [...] (from To <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life...) act as a taster of the different sound to come on their sophomore release. In September 2009, the band released [...] "Taxidermy" [...] as a digital download through iTunes for the first time. A live favourite amongst fans, the track had previously only been released on the (now deleted) vinyl release of [...] "To <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life". During the same month, the band supported Kings of Leon's tour of the United States, and Coldplay's tour of the United Kingdom. As well as this, the band played their own headline tour across Europe during October—November 2009, including some of their biggest shows to date in the UK. A number of the tour dates were later cancelled, due to McVeigh falling ill during their concert in Munich, Germany. Having fully recovered in time for the beginning of their UK dates, the tour continued as normal, with cancelled dates being rescheduled for February 2010.|$|E
500|$|During {{the trial}} of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed {{a letter to the}} King {{promising}} his loyalty. [...] "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," [...] the letter read, [...] "had rather <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere you conquer France." [...] Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: [...] "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, [...] "Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Number", {{a single}} that Collins only {{released}} in the US, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 charts during late September 1985, and the B-side of the single was [...] "We Said Hello Goodbye". Collins had difficulty conceptualising a plot for the corresponding music video. He decided to create a gag video based on this difficulty. In the video, he talks to clients and directors, all giving him crazy conceptual ideas. Collins parodies several other videos, including those by Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth, Elton John, The Cars, and The Police. The singer also filmed parodies of Mad Max, western films, and samurai movies.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing critical reception. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{called the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most}} intense things I've seen in ages." [...] She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that [...] "The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have this weird duet, made me <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> shit and keeps popping into my head. It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon." [...] She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the [...] "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" [...] and allowed the viewers to see [...] "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss {{of the end of}} the entire world" [...] following the war.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the DJ" [...] was {{included}} in Zane Lowe's Hottest Tracks of 2012; it finished second, while [...] "Calling (<b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Mind)" [...] by Sebastian Ingrosso and Alesso came first. Jack Brad, writing for Hive Magazine, said the song was a [...] "fun and funky" [...] track showcasing a different musical direction for the band. He also said it encompassed a [...] "catchy melody and...infectious chorus" [...] that proves the band was capable of experimenting with new musical styles on every new production, citing Warning (2000) and Nimrod (1997) as examples. David Renshaw from Gigwise said [...] "Kill the DJ"'s music video was not as violent as previous clips by the band; he said, [...] "those who attended the band's brilliant Reading Festival set in August will testify" [...] that things can get more violent than scenes in the video.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2009, the band were featured in numerous polls as [...] "ones to watch" [...] for the coming year. The BBC placed them second in their Sound of 2009 poll, as well as coming third in the 2009 BRITs Critics' Choice Award, behind Florence and the Machine and Little Boots.

500|$|Some of {{the songs}} from the album emerged from Collins' improvisations with a drum machine, {{including}} the singles [...] "One More Night" [...] and [...] "Sussudio". Collins started singing [...] "one more night" [...] to an attempt of making a beat similar to The Jacksons, and improvised [...] "sus-sussudio" [...] in another. Collins tried to replace the lyric with another phrase but decided to keep that way, leading to lyrics about a schoolboy crush on a girl at his school. Another song created mostly through improvisation, [...] "Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Number", was described by Collins as having been written mostly during the recordings for his first solo album, Face Value. Collins added {{that he does not}} fully understand the meaning of the lyrics, described by reviewer Stephen Holden of The New York Times as [...] "vague, sketching the outlines of a melodrama but withholding the full story".|$|E
500|$|Ranaut {{lives in}} Mumbai {{with her sister}} Rangoli, who {{was the victim of}} an acid attack in 2006. She makes yearly visits to her {{hometown}} of Bhambla. A practicing Hindu, Ranaut follows the teachings of the spiritual leader Swami Vivekananda and considers meditation to be [...] "the highest form of worshipping God". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as [...] "India's hottest vegetarian" [...] in a poll conducted by PETA in 2013. Since 2009 Ranaut has been studying the dance form of kathak from the Nateshwar Nritya Kala Mandir. She has said that the technical process of filmmaking is of tremendous interest to her, and to better her understanding of it Ranaut enrolled in a two-month screenplay writing course at the New York Film Academy in 2014. In an interview with Filmfare she said that despite her stardom, she wants to lead a normal life: [...] "I don't want to <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> rights as a common person to learn and grow".|$|E
500|$|... "We Said Hello Goodbye" [...] {{appeared}} as a B-side to [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Number" [...] originally, and as an [...] "extra track" [...] on the CD release of the album. Producer Arif Mardin composed the beginning portion of the song. A remix of the song with additional guitars and without an orchestra was released the following year (1986) on the soundtrack for the movie, Playing for Keeps. This remixed version received some radio airplay {{around the time of}} the soundtrack's release (which coincided with the No Jacket Required period), though it did not chart. Collins has mused that the song is unfairly classed as a [...] "second class citizen", stating that the song would have been looked at differently if it were added to the album. According to The New York Times reviewer Caryn James, the song is [...] "a straightforward comment on leaving home".|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} casting decision {{was that of}} the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers. Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that [...] "he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it." [...] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left. Burns himself stated, [...] "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile. Win or <b>lose,</b> <b>my</b> grave will be here".|$|E

I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character.
