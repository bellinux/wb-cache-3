5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
25|$|Two {{antennae}} and two {{field coils}} are used, both arranged {{at right angles}} to each other. The area between the two field coils is filled with an analog of the original signal from the antennae. The sense coil, another <b>loop</b> <b>antenna,</b> is placed in the area between the field coils. Rotating the sense coil in the field coils has the same output as rotating the entire <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> in the original field.|$|E

5000|$|CODAR is a [...] "direction finding system". The {{signal is}} {{received}} by two <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> and a monopole. Whereas the signal the monopole receives does not {{vary with the}} direction of the incoming signal, the signal received by the two <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> (positioned at a 90° angle) does vary with direction. This information permits a software to determine {{the direction of the}} signal.|$|R
25|$|This technique, {{known as}} radio {{direction}} finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate. Measurements better than a few degrees are difficult with a small antenna, {{and because of the}} electrical characteristics, it is not always easy to make a larger version that might provide more accuracy. Moreover, the addition of a <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> may be difficult on smaller vehicles, or difficult to operate for those without a dedicated navigator.|$|E
25|$|The {{navigator}} on the Lady Be Good {{thought he}} was flying on a direct path from Naples to Benghazi. But the base's radio direction finder only had a single <b>loop</b> <b>antenna.</b> As the plane's direction finder could not distinguish between a signal in front or behind the aircraft, {{there was no way}} to identify reciprocal readings. The same bearing would be returned whether the plane was heading inbound from the Mediterranean or outbound inland.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} flew on a 150 {{degree course}} toward Benina Airfield. The craft radioed for a directional {{reading from the}} HF/DF station at Benina and received a reading of 330 degrees from Benina. The actions of the pilot in flying 440 miles into the desert, however, indicate the navigator probably took a reciprocal reading {{off the back of}} the radio directional <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> from a position beyond and south of Benina but 'on course'. The pilot flew into the desert, thinking he was still over the Mediterranean and on his way to Benina.|$|E

25|$|During {{experiments}} in 1907, Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi noticed {{that they could}} cause the received signal to be re-radiated by forming a loop with multiple winds of wire. Using two loop antennae arranged at right angles and two sets of these small wire coils arranged the same way, the directional properties of the original radio signal were re-created. Direction finding could then be carried out with a conventional <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> placed {{in the center of}} these two stators (or field coils); the rotating loop was known as the rotor (or sense coil).|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of portable radio {{systems in the}} early 20th century {{gave rise to the}} possibility of using radio broadcasters (beacons) as a landmark that would be visible to a radio receiver at very great ranges, hundreds of miles or more. The angle between the navigator and the beacon can be taken by using a simple mechanism known as a <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> which can be rotated around the vertical axis. As the antenna is rotated, the strength of the received signal varies, and drops to zero (the null) when the loop is perpendicular to the line to the beacon.|$|E
25|$|The <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> {{uses this}} {{principle}} in a convenient and mechanically robust form. For vertically polarized signals, reception {{on the top}} and bottom of the loop is very low, so it has little contribution or effect on the output. So although the antenna is a complete loop, only the vertical sections have any action on the reception and it acts as two separated antennae. To measure the bearing of a transmitter, the loop is spun about its vertical axis until the signal drops to zero, or nulls, which is a much sharper signal that the maximum.|$|E

5000|$|Controlled {{volumetric}} range - RuBee has {{a maximum}} volumetric range of approximately 10,000 square feet (900 m²), using volumetric <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> — From {{even a small}} volumetric antenna of 1 sq ft (900 cm²), RuBee can read a tag within an egg-shaped (ellipsoid) volume of about 10 x 10 x 15 ft (3 x 3 x 5 m).

500|$|On the ground, {{to obtain}} {{directional}} radio beams with a well-defined navigable course, crossed loop antennas were used initially. The first loop-based LFR system {{was commissioned by}} the U.S. Commerce Department on June 30, 1928. But the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> design suffered from poor performance, especially at night, and by 1932 the Adcock antenna array, which had superior accuracy, became the preferred solution and replaced the loop antennas. The U.S. Commerce Department's Aeronautics Branch referred to the Adcock solution as the [...] "T-L Antenna" [...] (for [...] "Transmission Line") and did not initially mention Adcock's name.|$|E
2500|$|The Orfordness Beacon was {{a simple}} {{solution}} to these problems, which essentially moved the <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> from the vehicle to the beacon. The station broadcast a continuous AM longwave signal at 288.5kHz (1040m) through a large <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> that was mechanically rotated 1rpm, or 6 degrees a second. As the antenna passed north, the signal was briefly keyed with the morse code signal for the letter [...] "V", before returning again to a continuous signal.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{sources have}} noted Earhart's {{apparent}} {{lack of understanding of}} her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength [...] "bands", marked 1 to 5. The <b>loop</b> <b>antenna</b> was equipped with a tuneable loading coil that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.|$|E
40|$|The {{small-scale}} {{nature of}} CubeSats presents {{a challenge for}} researchers looking to integrate large antennas that are suited for experiments using very low frequencies (VLF, 3 - 30 kHz). <b>Loop</b> <b>antennas</b> hold several advantages over monopole and dipole voltage probes {{because they are not}} subject to the same size restrictions. Monopoles and dipoles have to be larger to achieve the same gain and performance as <b>loop</b> <b>antennas.</b> Conversely, <b>loop</b> <b>antennas</b> hold a disadvantage in that they require stiffeners to maintain the loop structure which poses challenges in both stowage and deployment. To address these challenges, the University of Florida has been developing an innovative solution to store and deploy a 16 meter square-loop antenna that can be stored within a 1 U volume. The design consists of four 2. 8 meter long booms to support the antenna element and a novel deployment mechanism to entanglement.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a single-wound {{toroidal}} {{helix antenna}} (SWTHA) and a contra-wound toroidal helix antenna (CWTHA) are analyzed in an analytical way. In this connection, the total winding {{length of a}} SHTA is estimated and a fairly accurate and closed-form expression of the length is obtained. Meanwhile, a closed form solution of the electromagnetic fields in far zone or their alternative vector potential components is obtained. The formulation is analytical, {{based on the assumption}} of uniform SWTHA and CWTHA currents and the large ratio of the toroidal antenna radius over the turn radius. The solution is general enough for any number of wound turns. The results are finally reduced to those existing results available elsewhere in literature by letting the radius be zero (for infinitely thin wire and circular <b>loop</b> <b>antennas)</b> and the winding number be zero (for the normal circular <b>loop</b> <b>antennas).</b> The reduced results of the potential components are the same as those in the textbooks. The analytical results are obtained for the first time, useful for antenna designers and also antenna engineering education.
