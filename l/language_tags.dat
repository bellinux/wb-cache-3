25|$|Unicode {{deals with}} variant {{characters}} in a complex manner, {{as a result of}} the process of Han unification. In Han unification, some variants that are nearly identical between Chinese-, Japanese-, Korean-speaking regions are encoded in the same code point, and can only be distinguished using different typefaces. Other variants that are more divergent are encoded in different code points. On web pages, displaying the correct variants for the intended language is dependent on the typefaces installed on the computer, the configuration of the web browser and the <b>language</b> <b>tags</b> of web pages. Systems that are ready to display the correct variants are rare because many computer users do not have standard typefaces installed and the most popular web browsers are not configured to display the correct variants by default.|$|E

2500|$|The BIA {{model is}} an {{implemented}} connectionist model of bilingual visual word recognition. This language-nonselective model is structured by four hierarchical levels of different linguistic representations: letter features, letters, words, and <b>language</b> <b>tags</b> (or language node). When a word is presented by this model, {{the features of}} its constituted letters are firstly activated. Then, these letter features work together and activate the letters {{of which they are}} part in the presented words. [...] In turn, these letters activate the words of that language. The word candidates activate the language nodes which are connected. They simultaneously send feedback activation to the letter level. Language nodes can also inhibit the activation of word candidates from other languages (e.g., the English language node reduces the activation of Dutch word candidates). After a complex interactive process of activation and inhibition, the lexical candidate corresponding to the presented word becomes the most active word unit.|$|E
2500|$|Unicode {{claims that}} [...] "Ideally, {{there would be}} no pairs of z-variants in the Unicode Standard." [...] This would make it seem that the goal is to at least unify all minor variants, {{compatibility}} redundancies and accidental redundancies, leaving the differentiation to fonts and to <b>language</b> <b>tags.</b> This conflicts with the stated goal of Unicode to take away that overhead, and to allow any number of any of the world's scripts {{to be on the same}} document with one encoding system. Chapter One of the handbook states that [...] "With [...] Unicode, [...] the [...] information [...] technology [...] industry [...] has [...] replaced [...] proliferating [...] character sets [...] with [...] data [...] stability, [...] global interoperability [...] and [...] data [...] interchange, [...] simplified [...] software, and reduced development costs. While [...] taking [...] the [...] ASCII [...] character [...] set [...] as [...] its [...] starting [...] point, [...] the [...] Unicode [...] Standard [...] goes [...] far beyond ASCII’s limited ability to encode only the upper- and lowercase letters A through Z. It [...] provides [...] the [...] capacity [...] to [...] encode [...] all [...] characters [...] used [...] for [...] the [...] written [...] languages [...] of [...] the world -- more than 1 million characters can be encoded. No escape sequence or control code is required to specify any character in any language. The Unicode character encoding treats [...] alphabetic [...] characters, [...] ideographic [...] characters, [...] and [...] symbols [...] equivalently, [...] which means they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility." ...|$|E
