40|$|We {{analyzed}} the insulin receptor gene in four patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> {{and one with}} type A insulin resistance. We detected novel and previously reported mutations. The novel mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells to evaluate the consequences for insulin receptor function. A type A insulin resistance patient from Morocco was homozygous for Arg 252 His mutation, similar to a previously described type A patient from Japan. A patient with <b>leprechaunism</b> was homozygous for the Ser 323 Leu mutation, previously identified in homozygous form in two patients with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. Phenotypic expression of this mutation is variable. A patient with <b>leprechaunism</b> is compound heterozygous for the previously described Arg 1092 Trp mutation and a nonsense mutation in eodon 897. Another patient with <b>leprechaunism</b> was homozygous for a novel Asn 431 Asp mutation, which only partially reduces insulin proreceptor processing and activation of signaling cascades. The novel Leu 93 Gln mutation that fully disrupts proreceptor processing was found in one allele in a patient with <b>leprechaunism.</b> A nonsense mutation at codon 1122 was in the other allele. These results expand the number of pathogenic insulin receptor mutations and demonstrate the variability in their phenotypic expression. The biochemical analysis of mutant insulin receptors does not reliably predict whether the phenotype will be <b>leprechaunism,</b> the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, or type A insulin resistance.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Leprechaunism</b> {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. In this report; we present a 75 days old infant with leprecahunism treated by high dose insulin glargine. Case Report: Yetmiş day old girl was diagnosed as <b>leprechaunism</b> because of the hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis and dysmorphic appearance. Huge cysts with multiple septa were determined in her ovaries. High dose insulin glargine were adjusted to achieve target blood glucose regulation. Huge ovarian cysts resolved by this treatment. Conclusion: <b>Leprechaunism</b> is characterized by intra-uterine and postnatal growth restriction, lipo-atrophy, characteristic facial features, severe acanthosis nigricans, abnormal glucose homeostasis, clitoromegaly and hirsutism.

40|$|<b>Leprechaunism</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder, so called {{because of the}} elfin features and small stature of affected individuals. It is a severe disorder of insulin-resistance, characterized by intrauterine and neonatal growth retardation, distended abdomen, decreased subcutaneous fat, acanthosis nigricans, genitomegaly, muscular hypertrophy, and lipoatrophy. Extreme resistance to insulin leads to severe hyperinsulinemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, and a characteristic fasting hypoglycemia. Distinctive craniofacial features include protuberant low-set ears, flaring nostrils, and thick lips. The syndrome is extremely rare, with less than one affected patient in a million births. Diagnosis depends on molecular methods to find out mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Treatment considered involves administration of recombinant IGF- 1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3). <b>Leprechaunism</b> is usually lethal, with life span rarely exceeding a few months. Molecular Genetics The severe insulin resistance seen in <b>leprechaunism</b> is due to mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene located on 19 p 13. 2. These mutations lead to production of inactive receptors, which are unable {{to carry out the}} uptake of insulin into the cells. Recent studies have shown that along with the insulin receptor, functional abnormalities in the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor are also present in <b>leprechaunism,</b> which may contribute to the severity of the disease...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leprechaunism</b> {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} characterized by severe growth retardation and insulin resistance. Maximal epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding was reduced in fibroblasts from three unrelated patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> (Ark- 1, Can- 1, and Minn- 1) compared with control (0. 8 - 2. 2 %/mg protein vs. 5. 5 %/mg protein). This was due to a decrease in receptor affinity in Ark- 1 and Can- 1 {{and a decrease in}} receptor number in Minn- 1. In all cell lines, EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was also decreased to 18 - 60 % of control, whereas EGF internalization and degradation was normal. Sphingosine (40 microM), a protein kinase C inhibitor, increased EGF receptor affinity twofold in control cells and six- to nine-fold in cells of <b>leprechaunism.</b> However, sphingosine did not enhance EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation in either the controls or the patients' cells. By contrast, only one of the three cell lines of patients with the type A syndrome demonstrated a decrease in EGF binding and all demonstrated normal or near normal EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. These data indicate that in patients with <b>leprechaunism,</b> there are functional abnormalities of the EGF receptor, {{as well as of the}} insulin receptor, that may contribute to the severity of the syndrome.

40|$|Mutations in the insulin {{receptor}} gene {{cause the}} inherited insulin resistant syndromes <b>Leprechaunism</b> and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome. These recessive conditions {{are characterized by}} intrauterine and post-natal growth restrictions, dysmorphic features, altered glucose homeostasis, and early demise. The insulin receptor gene (INSR) maps to the short arm of chromosome 19 and is composed of 22 exons. Here we optimize the conditions for sequencing this gene and report novel mutations in patients with severe insulin resistance. Methods: PCR amplification of the 22 coding exons of the INSR gene was performed using M 13 -tailed primers. Bidirectional DNA sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator chemistry and M 13 primers and the product was analyzed on the ABI 3100 genetic analyzer. Data analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor software comparing the sequence to a reference INSR sequence (Genbank NC_ 000019). Results: We sequenced four patients with <b>Leprechaunism</b> or Rabson–Mendenhall syndromes as well as seven samples from normal individuals and confirmed previously identified mutations in the affected patients. Three of the four mutations identified in this group caused premature insertion of a stop codon. In addition, the INSR gene was sequenced in 14 clinical samples from patients with suspected insulin resistance and one novel mutation was found in an infant with a suspected diagnosis of <b>Leprechaunism.</b> Discussion: <b>Leprechaunism</b> and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome are very rare and difficult to diagnose.

40|$|International audienceAim <b>Leprechaunism,</b> a rare {{genetic disease}} {{resulting}} from mutations in two alleles of the insulin receptor gene, {{is characterized by}} severe insulin resistance, retarded growth and, usually, premature death. The ability of treatment with recombinant human {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (rhIGF 1) to improve metabolic and clinical parameters in the long-term is still controversial. Methods Mutations were looked for in the insulin receptor gene of a four-month-old female baby with <b>leprechaunism.</b> The patient's skin fibroblasts were analyzed for response to insulin and IGF 1. At the clinical level, the very long-term effects of treatment with rhIGF 1 /rhIGFBP 3 were evaluated by clinical and metabolic parameters. Results The patient's diagnosis was based on compound heterozygous mutations in two alleles of the insulin receptor gene, thus confirming <b>leprechaunism.</b> Cultured fibroblasts showed a decreased number of insulin receptors and were insulin-resistant. However, IGF 1 was able to stimulate IGF 1 receptor signalling, suggesting possible activation of a salvage pathway. Treatment with IGF 1 /IGFBP 3 for 8. 7 years, then IGF 1 for 2 years, resulted in normalization of circulating levels of IGF 1 and IGFBP 3. Large daily variations in glycaemia and insulinaemia persisted, but mean glycaemia decreased. Regarding growth, the patient's BMI Z score normalized and length/height score improved. Our patient presented normal neurological development and academic achievement. The treatment was free of adverse effects. Conclusion Our results provide evidence that rhIGF 1 with and without rhIGFBP 3 can prevent fatal outcomes, and improve growth and metabolic parameters, for more than 10 years in a patient with <b>leprechaunism.</b> Long-term rhIGF 1 for severe insulin resistance syndrome should be considere...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the insulin {{receptor}} gene {{can cause}} genetic syndromes such as <b>leprechaunism</b> {{that are associated}} with extreme insulin resistance. We have investigated a patient with <b>leprechaunism</b> born of a consanguineous marriage. All 22 exons of the insulin receptor gene were screened for mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Thereafter, the nucleotide sequences of selected exons were determined directly. The patient was homozygous for a point mutation in exon 2 of the insulin receptor gene which results in the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at codon 119. Thus, the mutant allele encodes a receptor that has a mutation in the putative insulin binding domain. Accordingly, the mutant receptor would be predicted not to transduce the insulin signal effectively. In spite of a homozygous abnormality of the insulin receptor gene and many of the clinical features of severe insulin resistance, the proband's clinical syndrome was noticeably different from previously described patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> who usually die within {{the first six months of}} life.

40|$|The insulin {{receptor}} is a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase.

Patients {{with the most}} severe syndrome, <b>leprechaunism,</b> have growth restriction, altered glucose homeostasis and early death (usually before 1 year of age). Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome is less severe, with survival up to 5 – 15 years of age. These disorders are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits. Here we report six new patients and correlate mutations in the insulin receptor gene with survival. Patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> were homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor and their cells had markedly impaired insulin binding (< 10 % of controls). Mutations in their insulin receptor gene inserted premature stop codons (E 124 X, R 372 X, G 650 X, E 665 X and C 682 X), resulting in decreased levels of mature mRNA, or affected the extracellular domain of the receptor (R 86 P, A 92 V, DN 281, I 898 T and R 899 W). Three patients with Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome {{had at least one}} missense mutation in the intracellular domain of the insulin receptor (P 970 T, I 1116 T, R 1131 W and R 1174 W). Expression studies in CHO cells indicated that the R 86 P, A 92 V, DN 281, I 898 T, R 899 W and R 1131 W mutations markedly impaired insulin binding (< 5 % of control), while the P 970 T, I 1116 T and R 1174 W mutant receptors retained significant insulin-binding activity.

40|$|Previously, we have {{described}} a novel qualitative defect in insulin receptors {{from a patient}} with a genetic form of extreme insulin resistance (<b>leprechaunism).</b> Receptors from this insulin-resistant child are characterized by two abnormalities: (a) an abnormally high binding affinity for insulin, and (b) a markedly reduced sensitivity of 125 I-insulin binding to alterations in pH and temperature. In this paper, we have investigated the kinetic mechanism of this abnormality in steady-state binding. The increased binding affinity for 125 I-insulin results from {{a decrease in the}} dissociation rate of the hormone-receptor complex. In addition, the cooperative interactions among insulin binding sites are defective with insulin receptors from this child with <b>leprechaunism.</b> With insulin receptors on cultured lymphocytes from normal subjects, both negative and positive cooperativity may be observed. Porcine insulin accelerates the dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex (negative cooperativity). In contrast, certain insulin analogs such as desoctapeptide-insulin and desalanine-desasparagine-insulin retard the dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex (positive cooperativity). With insulin receptors from the leprechaun child, positive cooperativity could not be demonstrated, although negative cooperativity appeared to be normal. It seems likely that the same genetic defect may be responsible for the abnormalities in both insulin sensitivity and positive cooperativity...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leprechaunism</b> {{and type}} A {{diabetes}} represent inborn errors of insulin resistance whose phenotypes suggested causation by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Cells cultured from patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> specifically lacked high-affinity insulin binding. Partial but {{different degrees of}} impairment were observed in cells cultured from first-degree relatives. Different mutations in the insulin receptor's a subunit were proposed in different families (Ark-i, Atl, Minn, Mount Sinai) based on phenotype, cellular insulin binding, and insulin receptor structure. Molecular cloning and sequencing of mutant insulin receptor cDNA from family Ark-i confirmed that the proband inherited a maternal missense and a paternal nonsense mutation in the a subunit and was a compound heterozygote. The insulin receptor was immunologically present on the plasma membrane of fibroblasts cultured from patients Ark-I and Atl but was markedly reduced in cells from patients Minn and Mount Sinai. In cells from patient Minn, but not from patient Mount Sinai, the decreased number of insulin receptors was associated with reduced insulin receptor mRNA. In two families with the less severe form of insulin resistance, type A diabetes, mutations altered post-translational processing of the insulin receptor molecule. At a cellular level, these mutations of the a subunit of the insulin receptor shared defective binding and impaired stimulation of sugar transport by insulin. In family Atl, however, glucose uptake was constitutively increased. Thus, genetic variation in the insulin receptor gene causes a spectrum of inherited insulin-resistant syndromes and altered cellular signaling...|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{receptor}} {{function was}} examined in cultured skin fibroblasts from three patients with <b>leprechaunism</b> (Ark- 1, Minn- 1, and Can- 1), a rare syndrome of severe insulin resistance and neonatal growth retardation. All three patients cell lines demonstrated insulin binding less than 15 % of control. This was {{primarily due to}} reduced affinity of the receptor in Can- 1 and due to reduced number of receptors {{in the other two}} cell lines (Ark- 1 and Minn- 1). When expressed as a fraction of total insulin bound, the percentage of cell-associated insulin internalized and degraded did not differ between the patient cell lines and the controls. However, chloroquine, which inhibited degradation by 50 % in the control cells, had no effect in the cells from the patients. When normalized to insulin binding, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was normal in cells from Can- 1, but reduced in those of Ark- 1 and Minn- 1. In contrast, the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous substrates was decreased in all three patient cell lines. These results suggest that <b>leprechaunism</b> is a biochemically heterogenous disease associated with a variety of alterations in receptor function. Cells from Ark- 1 and Minn- 1 exhibit parallel alterations in receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. Cells from Can- 1 demonstrate normal receptor autophosphorylation but reduced kinase activity, thus displaying a unique form of a mutant insulin receptor. Despite reduced kinase activity, all three cell lines exhibit normal rates of insulin internalization, but decreased lysosomal-mediated degradation. Our data imply that receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity may be regulated separately and that kinase activity may be linked to insulin degradation, but not necessarily internalization...|$|E

In {{this study we}} analyze insulin binding and subunit structure of the insulin receptor in dermal fibroblasts cultured from three unrelated families whose probands (Ark- 1, Atl, and Minn) were affected by <b>leprechaunism.</b> Cells cultured from all three probands had markedly reduced insulin binding at equilibrium. Fibroblasts cultured from the parents of Ark- 1 and Atl had partial and differing degrees of impairment in insulin binding. The structure of the alpha subunit of insulin receptors was analyzed by cross-linking 125 I-insulin to plasma membranes. A major band of 350 kilodaltons (kD) (corresponding to the heterotetrameric insulin receptor alpha 2 beta 2) was observed in control and leprechaun fibroblasts. The relative amount of radioactivity cross-linked to plasma membranes reflected the genetic variations seen in insulin binding to intact cells. In reducing gels, 125 I-insulin was cross-linked equally to a 250 -kD (alpha-alpha dimer) and a 125 -kD (alpha monomer) protein in cells from controls, the parents of Ark- 1 and Atl, and probands Atl and Minn. By contrast, cells from the Ark- 1 proband had diminished cross-linking of alpha-alpha dimers. The ratio of dimer to monomer in cells from controls was 0. 93 +/- 0. 06, and that in cells from Ark- 1 was 0. 31 +/- 0. 19 (P less than. 01). Beta-subunit structure and function was analyzed by studying insulin-enhanced autophosphorylation. Although maximal stimulation of beta-subunit phosphorylation was reduced to 30 % in proband Ark- 1 fibroblasts, this reduction was quantitatively related to reduced insulin binding. These results indicate that mutations causing severe insulin resistance and defective insulin binding are transmitted with autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance and that heterogeneity exists for these mutations.

The R 86 P mutation {{is located in a}} putative β turn N-terminal to a proposed insulin binding domain of the receptor [P. DeMeyts, J. -L. Gu, R. M. Shymko, B. E. Kaplan, G. I. Bell, J. Whittaker, Mol. Endocrinol. 4 (1990) 409 – 416]. To get further insight into the mechanism of the paradoxical activation of receptor signalling by the R 86 P mutation, the codons for proline, alanine, and glycine were substituted in the R 86 position of the insulin receptor cDNA by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Insulin binding increased 10 – 20 fold in CHO cells transfected with the wild type, the R 86 A, and the R 86 G insulin receptor cDNA, but did not increase in cells expressing the R 86 P mutation. The R 86 P mutation caused a constitutive activation of insulin receptor phosphorylation in CHO cells, but did not increase basal glucose transport or its sensitivity to insulin stimulation. By contrast, transfection with the wild type and the R 86 A receptors increased 20 – 30 fold the sensitivity of glucose transport to stimulation by insulin. The R 86 G insulin receptor bound insulin normally, but was four times less efficient than the wild type or R 86 A insulin receptor in increasing the sensitivity for insulin stimulation of glucose transport. These results indicate that position 86 of the insulin receptor α subunit is tolerant to substitution by alanine, but not by proline. Substitution with glycine allows insulin binding, but does not activate normally glucose transport, further supporting an essential role of this position in the initiation of insulin receptor signalling of glucose transport...|$|E
