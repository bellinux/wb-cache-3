25|$|As the World Turns (often {{referred}} to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010. Irna Phillips created As the World Turns as a sister show to her other soap opera Guiding <b>Light.</b> <b>Running</b> for 54 years, As the World Turns holds the second-longest continuous run of any daytime network soap opera on American television, surpassed only by Guiding Light. As the World Turns was produced for the first 43 years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from 2000 until 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Parkour {{is practiced}} without {{equipment}} of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing. Traceurs who wear gloves are rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback. <b>Light</b> <b>running</b> shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps. Barefoot training {{is done by}} some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, [...] "bare feet are the best shoes." [...] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies {{around the world have}} started offering clothing targeted at parkour.|$|E
50|$|The war of {{currents}} {{grew out}} of the development of two lighting systems; arc <b>lighting</b> <b>running</b> on alternating current and incandescent <b>lighting</b> <b>running</b> on direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large area/street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential lighting.|$|R
50|$|Electric power {{distribution}} only became {{necessary in the}} 1880s when electricity started being generated at power stations. Before that electricity was usually generated where it was used. The first {{power distribution}} systems installed in European and US cites were used to supply lighting: arc <b>lighting</b> <b>running</b> on very high voltage (around 3000 volts) alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC), and incandescent <b>lighting</b> <b>running</b> on low voltage (100 volt) direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large area and street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential lighting.|$|R

2500|$|The Chancel is [...] east to west, and [...] {{north to}} south. The east chancel window, {{part of the}} 1868 restoration, is of three lights, the centre <b>light</b> <b>running</b> to the {{chamfered}} window arch, the outer lights running to the window arch spring. The mullions have three part circular shafts as dressing sitting on moulded bases, topped with floriated capitals. Above the two outer lights are quatrefoil rosettes set within fields of filigree style. A hood mould joins a 19th-century horizontal cill band, which runs across the wall face and continues in stepped fashion across east wall corner twin-stepped angle buttresses, and around {{the north and south}} chancel walls. The north and south chancel windows are of the same style, but of two lights. The north wall also contains a further c. 1270 single-lancet arched window, and an arched door way of the same date with the arch surrounded by a hood mould with personified carved label stops.|$|E
60|$|A Scotch {{half-breed}} {{took charge}} {{of him and his}} mates, and in company with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson. It was no <b>light</b> <b>running</b> now, nor record time, but heavy toil each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train, carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the Pole.|$|E
60|$|I went aft, {{ascended the}} poop, where, under the awning, gleamed the brasses of the yacht-like fittings, the {{polished}} {{surfaces of the}} rails, {{the glass of the}} skylights. Right aft two seamen, busy cleaning the steering gear, with the reflected ripples of <b>light</b> <b>running</b> playfully up their bent backs, went on with their work, unaware of me and of the almost affectionate glance I threw at them in passing toward the companion-way of the cabin.|$|E

60|$|Whilst Don Miguel was {{preparing}} for the fight, a slight sound suddenly caused him to turn towards {{that side of the}} room, from whence a tall oaken door led to his own and the Cardinal's apartments. His eyes, rendered peculiarly keen by the imminence of his own danger, quickly perceived a thin fillet of artificial <b>light</b> <b>running</b> upwards from the floor, which at once suggested to him that the door was slightly ajar.|$|E
60|$|Half-way there I {{stopped short}} and, holding my breath, listened intently. The wind had dropped {{and the rain}} had almost ceased, but the night was still as dark as pitch. I listened with {{strained}} ears and beating heart and soon I knew that I had not been mistaken. Coming down the hill between Rothland Wood gate and where I was, along the road by which we had just come, I could hear the faint, but nevertheless unmistakable, sound of <b>light,</b> <b>running</b> footsteps. Turning back, I stole softly down the path {{and stood in the}} middle of the road, waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give her something," [...] {{he whispered}} in panic. I was afraid. Then {{suddenly}} getting a florin from my pocket, I stiffened my nerves {{and slid it}} into her palm. Her hand was soft, and warm, and curled in sleep. She started violently, looking up at me, then down at her hand. I turned my face aside, terrified lest she should look in my eyes, and full of shame and grief I ran down the embankment to him. We hurried along under the plane trees in silence. The shining cars were drawing tall in the distance over Westminster Bridge, a fainter, yellow <b>light</b> <b>running</b> {{with them on the}} water below. The wet streets were spilled with golden liquor of light, and on the deep blackness of the river were the restless yellow slashes of the lamps.|$|E

60|$|Waiting {{till the}} sentry {{was at the}} other end of his beat, he slipped round the tent, {{stripped}} off his cloak, lay down his musket and belt--for Dick had arranged that they should carry off five muskets in their retreat-- threw off the Sepoy jacket, and in <b>light</b> <b>running</b> order, darted through the tents. He calculated that he should have at least a couple of minutes start before his absence was discovered, another minute or two before the sentry was sufficiently sure of it to hail the quarter-guard and report the circumstance. Then would follow the discovery of the escape of the prisoners; but by that time he would be far out on the plain, and even if seen, which was unlikely, he was confident that he could outrun any native.|$|E
6000|$|Ignacio shouted. The {{light of}} the {{carriage}} lamps, running along the nopal hedges that crowned the bank on each side, flashed upon the scared faces of people standing aside in the road, sunk deep, like an English country lane, into the soft soil of the Campo. They cowered; their eyes glistened very big for a second; and then the <b>light,</b> <b>running</b> on, fell upon the half-denuded roots of a big tree, on another stretch of nopal hedge, caught up another bunch of faces glaring back apprehensively. Three women--of whom one was carrying a child--and a couple of men in civilian dress--one armed with a sabre and another with a gun--were grouped about a donkey carrying two bundles tied up in blankets. Further on Ignacio shouted again to pass a carreta, a long wooden box on two high wheels, with {{the door at the}} back swinging open. Some ladies in it must have recognized the white mules, because they screamed out, [...] "Is it you, Dona Emilia?" ...|$|E
60|$|Their breath hung {{about them}} as they plodded on, but at length, {{when they came to}} the middle of the bend, where the hills curved out again, there was a break and they stopped at the end of a bridge. The low sun shone into the gap, which was profoundly deep and majestically beautiful. On its farther side, {{tremendous}} crags held up the snow, which trickled down their faces in thin gray streaks and stretched back above, steeped in soft blue shadow. On Foster's side, giant pines glimmered a bright green in the warm <b>light,</b> <b>running</b> up to a glittering slope that ended in two rugged peaks, and a river that sprang from a wrinkled glacier foamed through the dusky gorge. Where a small clearing had been cut in the forest, steep red roofs stood out in harmonious contrast with the green of the firs, and a picturesque wooden building with pillars and verandas occupied the greater part of the opening.|$|E

50|$|In theater, <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> are any {{lights that}} the {{audience}} does not see, but are on during a performance. They are different from worklights which are not used during a show. One type of <b>running</b> <b>light</b> is the lights set in wings or crossovers for actors and technicians {{to find their way}} in the (mostly) dark. These are usually rope lights or traditional fixtures with a colored lamp or colored gel over them. Booth staff will also use <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> to illuminate control boards or scripts. One brand marketed for this specific purpose is LittLite. Cue lights are distinct from <b>running</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{mounted the}} hill yet farther by a rough {{staircase}} of chalky footholds {{cut in the}} turf. The hills about Wendover and, as far as I could see, all the hills in Buckinghamshire, wear a sort of hood of beech plantation; but {{in this particular case}} the hood had been suffered to extend itself into something more like a cloak, and hung down about the shoulders of the hill in wide folds, instead of lying flatly along the summit. The trees grew so close, and their boughs were so matted together, that the whole wood looked as dense as a bush of heather. The prevailing colour was a dull, smouldering red, touched here and there with vivid yellow. But the autumn had scarce advanced beyond the outworks; it was still almost summer {{in the heart of the}} wood; and as soon as I had scrambled through the hedge, I found myself in a dim green forest atmosphere under eaves of virgin foliage. In places where the wood had itself for a background and the trees were massed together thickly, the colour became intensified and almost gem-like: a perfect fire green, that seemed none the less green for a few specks of autumn gold. None of the trees were of any considerable age or stature; but they grew well together, I have said; and as the road turned and wound among them, they fell into pleasant groupings and broke the light up pleasantly. Sometimes there would be a colonnade of slim, straight tree-stems with the <b>light</b> <b>running</b> down them as down the shafts of pillars, that looked as if it ought to lead to something, and led only to a corner of sombre and intricate jungle. Sometimes a spray of delicate foliage would be thrown out flat, the light lying flatly along the top of it, so that against a dark background it seemed almost luminous. There was a great bush over the thicket (for, indeed, it was more of a thicket than a wood); and the vague rumours that went among the tree-tops, and the occasional rustling of big birds or hares among the undergrowth, had in them a note of almost treacherous stealthiness, that put the imagination on its guard and made me walk warily on the russet carpeting of last year’s leaves. The spirit of the place seemed to be all attention; the wood listened as I went, and held its breath to number my footfalls. One could not help feeling that there ought to be some reason for this stillness; whether, as the bright old legend goes, Pan lay somewhere near in siesta, or whether, perhaps, the heaven was meditating rain, and the first drops would soon come pattering through the leaves. It was not unpleasant, in such an humour, to catch sight, ever and anon, of large spaces of the open plain. This happened only where the path lay much upon the slope, and there was a flaw in the solid leafy thatch of the wood at some distance below the level at which I chanced myself to be walking; then, indeed, little scraps of foreshortened distance, miniature fields, and Lilliputian houses and hedgerow trees would appear for a moment in the aperture, and grow larger and smaller, and change and melt one into another, as I continued to go forward, and so shift my point of view.|$|E
