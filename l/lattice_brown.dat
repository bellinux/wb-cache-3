25|$|At {{least two}} covered bridges make {{the claim of}} being the first built in the United States. Town records for Swanzey, New Hampshire, {{indicate}} their Carleton Bridge was built in 1789, but this remains unverified. Philadelphia, however, claims a bridge built in the early 1800s on 30th Street and over the Schuylkill River was the first, noting that investors wanted it covered to extend its life. Beginning around 1820, new designs were developed, such as the Burr, <b>Lattice,</b> and <b>Brown</b> trusses.|$|R
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} rigid lattice, it can {{be contaminated}} by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), <b>brown</b> (<b>lattice</b> defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).|$|R
