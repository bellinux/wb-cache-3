50|$|The Swedish Workplace HIV/AIDS Programme (SWHAP) {{is a joint}} {{initiative}} by the International Council of Swedish Industry (NIR) and the Swedish Industrial and Metalworkers’ Union (IF Metall). The SWHAP concept is based on close co-operation between the company management, the <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>branches</b> and workers' representatives. The programme contributes to the establishment and support to HIV and AIDS programmes at Swedish companies and their partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, SWHAP supported close to 90 workplaces directly and reached out to 20,000 employees, yet benefiting far more if {{taking into account the}} families and surrounding communities. The programme presently operates in Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

50|$|The {{congress}} in London {{was attended by}} delegates of {{many different kinds of}} organizations: educational and propaganda groups, national syndicalist confederations, <b>union</b> federations, <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>local</b> <b>branches</b> of national <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>local</b> <b>trades</b> councils, etc. All major European national syndicalist union confederations, except for the French CGT, sent delegates: the German FVdG, the Dutch NAS, the Swedish SAC, and the Italian USI. The Danish Fagsoppositionens Sammenslutning (FS) was represented by the SAC delegate Albert Jensen. Meanwhile, Argentina was represented by two syndicalist confederations, the Argentine Regional Workers' Confederation (CORA) gave its mandate to the Italian Alceste De Ambris, while the more radical Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA) sent a delegate of its own. The Brazilian Regional Workers' Federation, unable to send a delegate for financial reasons, opted to be represented by Guy Bowman. The Spanish National Confederation of Labour (CNT), banned at the time, was unable to have a representative travel to London, but the Catalan regional confederation was represented by a member living in temporary exile in France. Despite the CGT boycotting the meeting, a number of French delegates were present. The Paris hatters' union, six unions of construction workers from the capital, as well as three independent textile unions all sent delegates. The Belgian regional union Union des Syndicats de la Province de Liège was represented at the meeting, as was the Cuban Havana Union of Café Employees. Besides the hosts of the meeting the ISEL, a number of British <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> sent a total of nine delegates. Thus, a total number of twelve countries from Europe and Latin America had delegates at the First International Syndicalist Congress. The Austrian Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions</b> Association was unable to raise the funds to send a representative and therefore adhered without actually being present. Estimates of the total membership of the organizations that attended the meeting range between 220,000 and 250,000. Additionally, the American Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organizer George Swasey attended some of the sessions, though not as a delegate of his union. Cornelissen and the Russian anarcho-syndicalist Alexander Schapiro also attended, but did not represent any organization. Alfred Rosmer of the CGT attended the congress as a correspondent for La Vie Ovrière.|$|R

40|$|The {{prerequisites}} for <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> {{have changed in}} later years. Con-temporary changes in working-life raise new and important questions for the local boards to deal with. Changes of labour legislation anddecentralisation within the Swedish <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> movement have led to new tasks and greater responsibilities for the <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions.</b> The role of learning in the <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> union-s attempts to deal with contemporary challenges {{is the focus of}} this thesis. The presented case-study aims at understanding the conditions and circumstances that shape the kind of learning that takes place in the board of a local branch of a Swedish <b>trade</b> <b>union.</b> The importance of the everyday context for learning is a fundamental approach to the study. Theories stressing the situated character of learning have been used for understand-ing the activities of the shop stewards participating in the social practice of <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> work. The shop-stewards- attempts to deal with the challenges have been inter-preted as problem-solving. A pattern of three qualitatively different ways of solving problems has been identified. The shop stewards manage well prob-lems concerning the traditional <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> work, i. e. interpreting the legal framework in laws, agreements and instructions. There is no need for change. The second kind of problem-solving is about new problems within an area familiar to the shop-stewards. The shop-stewards also manage to solve this kind of problems. The shop-stewards do not manage the third kind, the new and complex questions where the legal framework is missing, e. g. outsourcing, competence development and bad working conditions as an effect of lean production. This third kind of problems can be seen as questions for destiny to the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> and its members. Learning in <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> is not just a local matter. In order to understand the <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> board-s difficulties to deal with the con-temporary challenges one must consider the aspects of power and relations to the counterpart, the employer. Decentralisation of trade union-work has changed the {{prerequisites for}} the <b>local</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions.</b> New technique, ways of organising work and globalisation of production and ownership are examples of new and important questions for <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> to deal with. These changed prerequisites concern the Swedish <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> movement as a whole...|$|R
