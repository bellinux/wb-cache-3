5|$|Kinuyo Tanaka, {{who played}} Miyagi, found the scene were {{she is a}} ghost {{to be the most}} stressful, as she had to play a ghost and appear to be an actual wife at the same time. After rehearsals and the shooting, Mizoguchi <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> for Mori, {{indicating}} his rare degree of satisfaction with the scene. Eitaro Ozawa, who played T≈çbei, said the actors frequently rehearsed alone, or with the cinematographer, while Mizoguchi was willingly absent during these preparations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that the most likely cause of the fire was that soon after arriving home, jet-lagged and tired, in the early hours, Marriott had <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> while in bed and almost immediately fallen into a deep sleep.|$|E
25|$|After {{the last}} take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu {{performance}} on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall which led to her bedroom, she collapsed with a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30a.m. lying in the hallway. The Jimmy Durante Show episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955, and a clip of the episode {{was included in the}} A Network's Biography episode about the singer.|$|E

25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{boarded the}} aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 (FAA {{registration}} N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by one account, 15D by another) {{in the rear}} of the passenger cabin. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and ordered a bourbon and soda. On-board witnesses described him as a man in his mid-forties, between [...] and [...] tall. He wore a black lightweight raincoat, loafers, a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black necktie, and a mother of pearl tie pin.|$|E

2500|$|On a third occasion, {{he tried}} to escape a camp by {{climbing}} its fences in broad daylight. He became entangled in barbed wire when he fell down between the two fences. When a prison guard pointed a pistol at his head and threatened to shoot, Upham calmly ignored him and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> This scene was photographed by the Germans as [...] "evidence" [...] and later reprinted in his biography (Mark of the Lion, by Kenneth Sandford).|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July Latham {{took off}} from Cap Blanc-Nez, very near Sangatte, but after only [...] his Antoinette IV {{suffered}} engine failure and Latham had to ditch in the Channel, thereby performing the world's first landing of an aircraft on the sea. The undamaged fuselage remained afloat, so he <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and awaited rescue by the French torpedo-destroyer Harpon that was following. After recovery of the aircraft, the engine was examined and a stray piece of wire was found inside the engine. [...] Levavasseur stated that the misfire was caused by this wire.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, {{the members}} of Elvis's band, visited Perkins {{on their way to}} New York to appear with Presley the next day. Fontana {{recalled}} Perkins saying, [...] "Of all the people, I looked up and there you guys are. You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me." [...] Black told him, [...] "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Perkins was given a telegram from Presley (which had arrived on March 23), wishing him a speedy recovery.|$|E

2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Dick <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{and blew}} smoke in Jen's {{direction}} {{while she was}} eating. Jen asked for Dick to stop, but he did not. Jen then reached to get the cigarette from Dick several times to which Dick began to burn Jen with his cigarette. Jen began to yell that Dick burned her on purpose. This incident ended with Dick yelling at Jen. Jen burst into tears and Jameka pulled Jen away from the confrontation and to the bathroom. Neither Jen nor Dick was expelled from the House and Jen was evicted on Day 55. Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely {{think he should have}} been kicked out, but obviously he was definitely entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 11, 1984, eight teenage {{visitors}} {{were trapped in}} the Haunted Castle attraction, and died when it was destroyed by fire. [...] Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company Six Flags were subsequently indicted for aggravated manslaughter, accused of recklessly causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire. [...] In the subsequent trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored. [...] The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was arson and that no precautions would have saved lives. [...] The trial jury found the defendants not guilty. A light bulb had burned out {{in one of the}} rooms of the attraction, and a 14-year-old boy <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter to find his way through the darkness. The flame ignited some foam rubber padding which was used to protect people from bumping into a wall. A fire resulted, which quickly spread throughout the 17-trailer structure with the help of extremely flammable building materials. The fire eventually engulfed and totally destroyed the attraction.|$|E
60|$|Bruce Carmyle gave it up, and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> moody <b>cigarette.</b> He was {{oppressed by}} that feeling {{which so many}} of us have felt in our time, that it was all wrong.|$|R

2500|$|Asquith was junior {{counsel in}} the North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration and the {{investigation}} of the sinking of the Titanic, and was considered a putative Liberal candidate for Derby. However, his rise was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially commissioned, on 17 December 1914, as a second lieutenant into the 16th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment. He was transferred to the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, on 14 August 1915 and assigned as a staff officer, but he requested to be returned to active duty with his battalion, a request granted before the Battle of the Somme. While leading the first half of 4 Company in an attack near Ginchy on 15 September 1916, at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, he was shot in the chest but famously <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> to hide the seriousness of his injuries so that his men would continue the attack. As a result, he died while being carried back to British lines. He was buried at Guillemont in the CWGC Guillemont Road Cemetery, where his headstone is inscribed 'Small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of England', a concluding line from Shakespeare's [...] "Henry V", about a warrior king who had died in his thirties after campaigns in France.|$|E
