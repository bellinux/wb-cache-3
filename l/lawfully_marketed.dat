50|$|Israel {{does not}} have {{regulations}} in place specific to the reprocessing of SUDs, but as a general matter, medical devices must be registered with the Ministry of Health (MOH) {{before they can be}} sold in the country. If a product is approved by the U.S. FDA, it will generally be registered by the MOH with no further testing requirements and, therefore, may be <b>lawfully</b> <b>marketed</b> in the country. Consistent with this policy, FDA-cleared reprocessed devices have been registered with MOH and are actively imported into the country.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, {{which only}} prohibits {{circumvention}} of access control measures, the Copyright Directive also prohibits circumvention of copy protection measures, making it potentially more restrictive. In both the DMCA and the Copyright Directive, production, distribution etc. of equipment used to circumvent both access and copy-protection is prohibited. Under the DMCA, potential users {{who want to}} avail themselves of an alleged fair use privilege to crack copy protection (which is not prohibited) {{would have to do}} it themselves since no equipment would <b>lawfully</b> be <b>marketed</b> for that purpose. Under the Copyright Directive, this possibility would not be available since circumvention of copy protection is illegal.|$|R

He {{supports}} neoliberal views of enterpreneurship, for which free market capitalism is [...] "necessary". He says that [...] "seeking profits is good per se {{and in a}} free and <b>lawfully</b> ordered <b>market</b> system it creates wellbeing for everyone". He criticizes Catholic social teachings because there were [...] "no exact formulations in the New Testament" [...] and they [...] "had always been a product of their time"."Inzwischen haben wir ein Sozialstaatskirchensystem bekommen, weil sich die Kirche in die Strukturen des umverteilenden Steuer- und Sozialstaates derart eingebunden hat, dass sie nicht mehr frei ist, ein System in Frage zu stellen, das zum Beispiel dem Subsidiaritätsprinzip eklatant widerspricht und ökonomisch falsche Anreize setzt." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Case E-3/00 Kellogg’s, the EFTA Court had {{to rule on}} the {{compatibility}} with Article 11 EEA of {{a ban on the}} import and marketing in Norway of Kellogg’s cornflakes fortified with vitamins and iron which have been <b>lawfully</b> manufactured and <b>marketed</b> in other EEA States. It rejected the argument of the Norwegian government that in order to justify a marketing ban on fortified cornflakes produced in Denmark it was sufficient to show the absence of a nutritional need for the fortification with vitamins and iron in the Norwegian population because of the government had already taken care of the problem by giving out certain fortified products to school children on a regular basis. At the same time, the EFTA Court held that in examining whether the marketing of fortified cornflakes that were produced in Denmark may be banned on grounds of the protection of human health, a national government may, in the absence of harmonization, invoke the precautionary principle. According to that principle, it is sufficient to show that there is relevant scientific uncertainty with regard to the risk in question. The Court stated that measures taken must be based on scientific evidence; they must be proportionate, non-discriminatory, transparent, and consistent with similar measures already taken. The conditions to be fulfilled by a proper application of the precautionary principle were, {{in the view of the}} Court, first, an identification of potentially negative health consequences, and secondly, a comprehensive evaluation of the risk to health, which must be based on the most recent scientific information. The EFTA Court added that the precautionary principle can never justify the adoption of arbitrary decisions and can justify the pursuit of the objective of “zero risk” only in the most exceptional circumstances. Since the Norwegian fortification policy did not, at the relevant time, fulfil the requirements of EEA law pertaining to the application of that principle, the Court came to the conclusion that Norway had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 11 EEA. In particular, the measures taken by Norway were considered inconsistent and not based on a comprehensive risk assessment.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of free movement is {{the elimination of}} obstacles to trade between Member States and thus by such, create free movement within the entire union. Therefore art 34 in the Treaty of Lisabon (FEUF) states that all quantative restrictions on imports and measures of equivalent effect are prohibited. The legal approach to measures having equivalent effect is still unclear {{and the purpose of}} this paper is therefore to propose a solution to that particular problem. What can be said when it comes to this rule is that the EU-Court has gone from applying a discrimination test to a market access doctrine. According to the Court´s case law, measures having equivalent effects to quantative restrictions are “All trading rules enacted by Member States which are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-community trade”.   The question of how to apply the test when it comes to a potential hinder to intra-community trade is still unclear. Connected to this is the remoteness test where hinders that are too indirect and uncertain cannot fall within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. The Courts case law has made it clear that a de minimis rule should not be applied so even small and unsubstantial hinders can fall within art 34 FEUF. The Court has also stated that a Member State that impedes a product from being imported to it´s territory when it has been <b>lawfully</b> produced and <b>marketed</b> in the member state of origin, constitutes a measure of equivalent effect to quantative restrictions. This is referred to as the Cassis doctrine. In the case law after Cassis, there were a lot of contradicitions as to what constitutes measures of equivalent effects. That problem was solved by the Court in the Keck case where all measures relating to “certain” selling arrangements is not as such as to hinder trade between Member States. However, that is the case as long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and as long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member States (Keckcriterias). The problem today in connection to Cassis and Keck is that it can be hard to make a distinction between selling arrangements and rules connected to product requirements. After the development in Keck, the Court stated in the Trailers case that those measures relating to the use of goods which prohibits or impedes the use of them, constitutes measures of equivalent effect and thus are prohibited because they impede the good´s access to the market. Post Keck case law confirmes that when it comes to Member States national measures, one must apply both the discrimination test and the market access test in order to find out whether the rules falls within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. How this test should be applied is still unclear today, which creates legal uncertainty. This is something for the Court to work on in the future.    Hiba Zeyd...|$|R
