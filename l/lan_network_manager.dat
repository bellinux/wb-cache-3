40|$|WLANs (Wireless LANs) are a {{cost-effective}} solution for impossible or hard-to-wire locations. WLANs are gaining popularity {{because they are}} easy to deploy and provide ubiquitous access to enterprise resources from anywhere in the campus. However, Enterprises and Campuses must become fully aware of the security and management implications of adding wireless technologies to their network. Organizations must tightly integrate wireless LANs with wired <b>LANs.</b> <b>Network</b> <b>managers</b> are reluctant or unwilling to deploy wireless LANs unless those LANs provide the type of security, manageability, and scalability offered by wired LANs. Since wireless LANs broadcast data over the air using radio waves, virtually any wireless LAN client in the area served by the data transmitter can access that data. It is impossible to direct a wireless LAN transmission to only one, intended recipient. So data privacy and security becomes a real concern. This article explains how a campus-wide WLAN solution can have tight security by providing dynamic, per-user, per-session WEP, and by deploying other security features like "Mutua...|$|R

[...] Version 1.0 of NETROOM was a re-packaged version of Helix's HeadRoom with the HeadRoom Network Extensions, bundled together and targeted to network users. NETROOM loaded network drivers into a virtual machine created using an expanded memory page frame. NETROOM allowed this virtual machine {{to run as}} a multitasked background process.

50|$|IBM grew {{concerned}} about the delays in development of OS/2 2.0. Initially, the companies agreed that IBM would take over maintenance of OS/2 1.0 and development of OS/2 2.0, while Microsoft would continue development of OS/2 3.0. In the end, Microsoft decided to recast NT OS/2 3.0 as Windows NT, leaving all future OS/2 development to IBM. From a business perspective, it was logical to concentrate on a consumer line of operating systems based on DOS and Windows, and to prepare a new high-end system {{in such a way}} as to keep good compatibility with existing Windows applications. While waiting for this new high-end system to develop, Microsoft would still receive licensing money from Xenix and OS/2 sales. Windows NT's OS/2 heritage can be seen in its initial support for the HPFS filesystem, text mode OS/2 1.x applications, and OS/2 <b>LAN</b> <b>Manager</b> <b>network</b> support. Some early NT materials even included OS/2 copyright notices embedded in the software.One example of NT OS/2 1.x support is in the WIN2K resource kit. Windows NT could also support OS/2 1.x Presentation Manager and AVIO applications with the addition of the Windows NT Add-On Subsystem for Presentation Manager.|$|R

To manage and monitor the control activities of network, the user should send an authentication SMS along with the required/desired function/action SMS to his/her server system via Global System for Mobile communication (GSM). Upon being properly authenticated, the cell phone-based interface would relay the commands to a server system that would perform the required function/action, and return a function completion SMS that {{would be sent to}} the administrator (user’s cell phone).
