The software supports intact and damaged <b>laminates</b> (see damage mechanics). For each category, cadec-online.com can calculate the <b>laminate</b> thermal stresses, <b>laminate</b> coefficient of thermal expansion, <b>laminate</b> stiffness and compliance matrices for composite <b>laminates.</b> Also, the application can predict the <b>laminate</b> moduli, which are orthotropic material equivalents for the stiffness of the <b>laminate</b> in both bending and membrane modes of deformation.|$|R

Cracks in GFRP <b>laminates</b> also formed at a lower stress and strain compared to CFRP <b>laminates.</b> Since GFRP <b>laminates</b> are transparent, new crack formation can be observed in-situ, while recording the corresponding values of applied strain.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thickness}} on the notched strength of three graphite/epoxy <b>laminates</b> is studied. The {{strength of the}} <b>laminates</b> is {{shown to be a}} function of <b>laminate</b> thickness. The notched strength of (0 /+ or - 45 / 90) ns and (0 / 90) ns <b>laminates</b> decreased toward asymptotic values with increasing <b>laminate</b> thickness, while that of the (0 /+ or - 45) ns <b>laminate</b> increased toward an asymptotic value with increasing <b>laminate</b> thickness. For all three <b>laminate</b> types, the notched strength decreased with increasing notch size, regardless of thickness. The fracture of the thick <b>laminates</b> was essentially uniform and self-similar with the notch. The 'universal' value of the general toughness parameter developed by Poe (1981) successfully predicts the notched strength of the thick <b>laminates...</b>|$|R
5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting.

5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or <b>laminated</b> stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that <b>laminated</b> stocks would be made.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of <b>laminated</b> wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laminate</b> is a {{material}} made by bonding layers of material or materials. <b>Laminate,</b> in technical terminology, {{is referred to}} as High Pressure <b>Laminate</b> (HPL) or even more accurately as High Pressure Decorative Plastic <b>Laminate</b> since there are also industrial high pressure <b>laminates</b> which are not decorative.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>laminate</b> {{thickness}} on the interlaminar stresses in rectangular quasi-isotropic <b>laminates</b> under unifor. r. axial strain was studied. <b>Laminates</b> from 8 -ply to infinitely thick wer, analyzed. Thick <b>laminates</b> were synthesized by stacking (45 / 0 /- 45 / 90) ply groups, rather than grouping like plies. <b>Laminates</b> {{with and without}} delaminations were studied. in <b>laminates</b> without delaminations, the free-edge interlaminar normal stress distribution in the outer ply groups was insensitive to total <b>laminate</b> thickness. The interlaminar normal stress distribution for the interior ply groups was nearly {{the same as for}} an infinitely thick <b>laminate.</b> In contrast, the free-edge interlaminar shear stress distri-bution was nearly the same for inner and outer ply groups and was insensitive to <b>laminate</b> thickness [...] In <b>laminates</b> with delaminations, those delaminations near the top and bottom surfaces of a thick <b>laminate</b> have much larger total strain-energy-release rates and mode I-to-total (G /GT) ratios than delaminations deep in the interior. Therefore, delaminations can be expected to grow more easily near the surfaces of a <b>laminate</b> than in the interior. This is consistent with experimental results reported in the literature. Also, near surface delaminations in thin <b>laminates</b> tend to have larger strain-energy release rates than corresponding near surface delaminations in thick <b>laminates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{microcracking}} {{process in}} <b>laminates</b> which have outer-ply 90 # plies (e. g. [90 m/ 0 n] s) has some important di#erences from the microcracking process in <b>laminates</b> which lack outer-ply 90 # plies (e. g. [0 n / 90 m] s). Foremost among the di#erences is the characteristic damage state. [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates</b> form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed di#erences, {{this paper presents}} a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminate</b> having staggered microcracks. The new analysis and a previous analysis of [0 m / 90 n] s <b>laminates</b> are {{used to assess the}} e#ect of <b>laminate</b> structure on the mechanical properties and failure properties of cross-ply <b>laminates.</b> The findings are: 1. A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> than in the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates.</b> 2. Although [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates</b> will develop more microcracks after continued loading. 3. A bending e#ect present in [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates</b> but not in [0 n / 90 m] s <b>laminates</b> promotes mode I delamination in [90 m/ 0 n] s <b>laminates...</b>|$|R

Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of <b>laminated</b> glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum.

The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s.

5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly <b>laminated</b> bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E

40|$|A {{design system}} of {{composite}} <b>laminates</b> has been developed. The system {{is capable of}} finding solutions to commonly faced design problems of continuous <b>laminates.</b> The target <b>laminate</b> is defined with a design specification consisting of constraints and objectives that can be set for important design attributes of <b>laminates.</b> The objectives are accompanied by weighting factors that specify their importance with respect to each other. Two tools are provided for problem solving: one for <b>laminate</b> evaluation, the other for <b>laminate</b> creation. The tools are called, respectively, the <b>laminate</b> evaluation tool and the <b>laminate</b> creation tool. A design specification, a set of candidate <b>laminates,</b> and analysis option settings define a <b>laminate</b> evaluation problem. The problem is solved in two steps. Feasible <b>laminates</b> satisfying all constraints are first sought. The multiobjective design technique is then applied to determine how well these <b>laminates</b> meet the objectives. A design specification, one or several candidate plies, and analysis option settings define a <b>laminate</b> creation problem. The creation process {{is divided into two}} phases. Feasible plies are first sought and ranked by creating and evaluating a set of <b>laminates</b> representing ply performance. The design space is constrained and approximate failure analysis techniques are used to obtain a solution in decent time. As a result of the phase, the <b>laminate</b> with the best performance is initially identified for each feasible ply. An attempt to improve the <b>laminate</b> can further be made in an extended design space and with generally accepted failure analysis techniques. The thesis describes the structure of the design system and the theories used in problem solving. Two sets of <b>laminates</b> are evaluated against typical design specifications to demonstrate the performance of the <b>laminate</b> evaluation tool. The performance of the <b>laminate</b> creation tool is demonstrated by solving typical design problems. The results indicate that the developed tools are capable of finding optimal solutions in the specified design space. reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Comparison of CFRP <b>laminates</b> with 90 o ply of {{different}} thicknesses (Table 5) {{indicates that the}} <b>laminate</b> with the thicker transverse ply fail at lower stress than the <b>laminate</b> with the thinner transverse ply. Similar behavior {{can be observed in}} the angle-ply <b>laminates</b> where thinner <b>laminates</b> showed higher stiffness and strength, {{as can be seen in}} Figs.  3 b & c and 4 b & c and Table 5. This is because the Energy Release Rate (ERR) associated with the formation of cracks in the thicker <b>laminates</b> is higher, thus caused cracks to form earlier in the thicker <b>laminates.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, <b>laminated</b> timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or <b>laminated</b> glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the <b>laminated</b> beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} chamber is the roof. The roof is {{supported}} by a structure of <b>laminated</b> oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods from the walls.

In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone {{in the structure of the}} debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian <b>laminated</b> bows. However, archaeological {{investigation}} of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E

30|$|Intralaminar damage {{behavior}} {{and its effects}} on the mechanical properties of several angle-ply FRP <b>laminates</b> were investigated. CFRP and GFRP <b>laminates</b> with fiber configuration of [θ_m/σ_n]s were used in this study. In order to study the damage {{behavior and}} its effects, the <b>laminates</b> were loaded monotonically and cyclically and cracks observations were carried out. In some angle-ply <b>laminates,</b> artificial cracks method were used before the <b>laminates</b> were monotonically loaded, so that higher crack densities could be attained. From monotonic tensile tests, it can be understood that as the middle off-axis ply becomes thicker, the Young’s modulus and maximum tensile stress of the <b>laminates</b> decreases. On the other hand, the differences in off-axis orientations have marginal effects on the stiffness and strength of a <b>laminate.</b> From the cyclic loading results, for CFRP <b>laminates</b> of the same thickness, changes in the off-axis angle from 90 o to 45 o, earlier cracking initiation and observed nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves were recorded. Changes in the transverse strain, which reflect the effective Poisson’s ratio of the <b>laminate,</b> were larger in <b>laminates</b> with off-axis angle 45 o than in <b>laminates</b> with off-axis angle 90 o. For CFRP <b>laminates,</b> it can be observed that first cracks mostly formed and accumulated at free edges. Crack propagation rates in the width direction were dependent on the thickness of the middle ply. In contrast to CFRP <b>laminates,</b> cracks in GFRP <b>laminates</b> formed instantaneously propagating in the width direction. Stiffness in <b>laminates</b> with the thicker off-axis plies reduced more. The experimental data and predictions of the variational analysis are found in good agreement for the Young’s modulus of the cracked <b>laminate.</b> Based on these results, we hope that in future work, we can study <b>laminates</b> of higher practical imprtance. The comparison of both experimental result and analytical result demonstrated the ability of the approaches to accurately predict the effect of transverse cracking on the stiffness of the <b>laminates,</b> independently on their layups. Systematic analysis of residual strains due to increasing crack density will be addressed in future publications.|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of notched composite <b>laminates</b> {{is determined to}} find its worthiness for the intended application and it is affected by various factors, such as, application of fatigue loading, notch location, notch shape and size, etc. In the present work, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the effects of fatigue loading and notch location on the {{reliability of}} notched composite <b>laminates.</b> The reliability values of notched <b>laminates</b> are calculated by using the following parameters: the stress developed in the <b>laminate</b> due to external loading and the strength of the corresponding un-notched <b>laminates.</b> Since composite <b>laminates</b> exhibit stochastic variations in material properties, Stochastic Finite Element Analysis (SFEA) is used to calculate the stresses developed in the <b>laminate.</b> The ultimate strengths of the un-notched <b>laminates</b> are found out experimentally. Tests are conducted on specimens made of NCT 301 graphite/epoxy material to determine the material properties that are required for the SFEA. The material properties are modeled using Markov model based on the test data by two dimensional stochastic processes. Tests are also conducted on center-notched <b>laminates</b> subjected to fatigue loading conditions, Edge-notched <b>laminates</b> and un-notched <b>laminates</b> to determine their ultimate strength values. In practical applications, it is difficult to achieve a perfect circular profile during the drilling operation of notched composite <b>laminates</b> and {{there is a possibility that}} the drilled hole is offset from the desired location. These imperfections affect the reliability of the notched <b>laminate.</b> In the present work the perturbation in the circular profile of the hole is modeled using a hypotrochoid variation and the location of the hole center is modeled using a Gaussian random variable.
