We share {{the same type of}} {{religion}} and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
25|$|Mental {{events have}} a certain {{subjective}} quality to them, whereas physical seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like. Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events qualia. There is something that it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rob LeDonne, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons explained {{the inspiration for the}} song: [...] "Well, the thing we learned after touring with Doo Wops was how it is we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> on stage when performing. We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't really get {{to do a lot of}} that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E

500|$|Philosophers of mind {{call the}} {{subjective}} aspects of mental events [...] "qualia" [...] or [...] "raw feels". There {{is something that}} it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – {{what it is like}} to see the color red.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that the existing program {{can do for the}} engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make you a good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{retrospective}} reviews, Winter in America {{was well}} received by critics, who cite {{it as one}} of Scott-Heron's best albums. Uncut magazine's Barney Hoskyns praised the album, calling it an [...] "introspective seasonal offering from black poet-singer and collaborating pianist". He also lauded its critical content and called it [...] "a masterwork of ghetto melancholia and stark political gravitas". Ron Wynn of AllMusic wrote of Scott-Heron's performance, in that he was [...] "at his most righteous and provocative on this album", while acknowledging Jackson's contributions as well. BBC Online's Daryl Easlea called the album [...] "an affecting work" [...] and wrote that its title track [...] "should be played as standard on all modern history courses as a snapshot of the stilted hopes and aspirations in the post Watergate and Vietnam War mid 70s America". The Washington Posts Richard Harrington cited [...] "The Bottle" [...] and [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] as [...] "classic Scott-Heron works" [...] in a review of its reissue. Los Angeles Times writer Mike Boehm viewed that its title track [...] "sounded a sad death-knell for '60s hopes of transforming change", while calling it a [...] "wonderful mood piece, capturing what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> oppressed in your soul by outer-world events that seem out of control". Danny Eccleston of Mojo called it an [...] "alloy of Rhodes-laden souljazz with 's razor-sharp beat-poetry" [...] and quipped, [...] "Anger, radicalism, humour and funk from the proto-rapper, thankfully restored to health and liberty." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He <b>Liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>Feel</b> It" [...] {{proved to}} be a hit in the band's native Canada, {{becoming}} their highest-peaking career single at #2 on the Canadian singles chart. Despite the single's success domestically, [...] "He <b>Liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>Feel</b> It" [...] made minimal chart impact abroad, perhaps due to controversy surrounding the track's music video hindering its promotional efforts. A second single, [...] "My Own Sunrise", would follow in January 1997, becoming a minor hit for the band, with [...] "My Enemies" [...] following as the album's third and final single later that year, also making limited impact.|$|R

2500|$|The Tao Te Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages over 250 times, mostly to English, German, and French. According to Holmes Welch, [...] "It is a famous puzzle which everyone would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> he had solved." [...] The first known English translation of the Tao Te Ching was produced in 1868 by a Scottish Protestant missionary named John Chalmers, entitled The Speculations on Metaphysics, Polity and Morality of The Old Philosopher Lau Tsze. Other notable English translations of the Tao Te Ching are those produced by Chinese scholars and teachers: a 1948 translation by linguist Lin Yutang, a 1961 translation by author John Ching Hsiung Wu, a 1963 translation by sinologist Din Cheuk Lau, another 1963 translation by professor Wing-tsit Chan, and a 1972 translation by Taoist teacher Gia-Fu Feng together with his wife Jane English.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{continued}} to develop Spock alongside individual directors. When work was underway on [...] "Amok Time", he discussed with Joseph Pevney how Vulcans would greet each other. Nimoy suggested {{the use of}} a hand signal from the Priestly Blessing as performed by Jewish Kohen. He had seen this as a child, although Nimoy's father had told him not to look as they performed the blessing. This became the basis for the Vulcan salute. Solow later said that Nimoy was the key contributor to the character's depiction, saying that the [...] "Mr Spock character was 20% created by Gene Roddenberry, 20% created by me and 60% created by Leonard Nimoy". Nimoy recalled, [...] "As a Jew from Catholic Boston, I understood what it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> alienated, apart from the mainstream... {{there were a number of}} values in Star Trek that I felt very comfortable with as a Jew". The character influenced Nimoy as well; years after the show he wrote that [...] "To this day, I sense Vulcan speech patterns, Vulcan social attitudes and even Vulcan patterns of logic and emotional suppression in my behavior." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{should have}} been sufficient, but Grace was not quite contented. Compliments on her beauty seldom pleased her, but she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the hold she had upon those she attracted, and was not averse to having it {{explained}} to her.|$|R
60|$|Thus he kept {{watch over}} her, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> she was there. The {{consciousness}} of her living presence stimulated him. But she remained {{more or less}} an ideal character, about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic day-dreams.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] he admitted. [...] "But {{you must}} {{remember}} that suspicion is of itself a grievous embarrassment. No man <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that he is being suspected of murder. By the bye, is it known whom the unfortunate person was?" ...|$|R

60|$|He was so strange, so simple-minded, so {{different}} {{in every way}} from all other men, {{that for a moment}} Frida almost half-forgot to be angry with him. In point of fact, in her heart, she was not angry at all; she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the soft pressure of his strong man's hand on her dainty fingers; she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the gentle way he was stroking her smooth arm with that delicate white palm of his. It gave her a certain immediate and unthinking pleasure to sit still by his side and know he was full of her. Then suddenly, with a start, she remembered her duty: she was a married woman, and she OUGHT NOT to do it. Quickly, with a startled air, she withdrew her hand. Bertram gazed down at her for a second, half taken aback by her hurried withdrawal.|$|R
5000|$|... "He <b>Liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>Feel</b> It" [...] {{is a song}} by Canadian group Crash Test Dummies and was {{the first}} single from their 1996 album A Worm's Life.

60|$|Not {{reflecting}} that {{it would}} be more difficult for Miss Helstone than for himself to climb a wall or penetrate a hedge, he piloted her by a short cut which led to no gate.

5000|$|Originally [...] "Overachievers" [...] {{was planned}} as the album's lead single (then titled [...] "The Over-Achievers"), with the band's {{producer}} Jeff Rogers even noting {{at the time}} that the band had contacted three different directors for music video concepts to complement that track's release.
