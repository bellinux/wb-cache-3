50|$|During {{economic}} downturns, {{central banks}} often {{lower interest rates}} to stimulate growth. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} rates couldn't go below zero because people would hold on to <b>cash</b> instead <b>of</b> paying a fee to deposit it. It turns out this was not quite right.

The notion is that negative rates will provide even more incentive for commercial banks to make loans.
