5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. When the men begged him to at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at latest {{with the}} Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a {{distinct}} Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets {{were found in}} the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> us an idea how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{lasted about}} 50 days from December14, 1998, to February 1999. American Beauty was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and at Hancock Park and Brentwood in Los Angeles. The aerial {{shots at the}} beginning and end of the film were captured in Sacramento, California, and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in Torrance, California; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students. The film is set in an upper middle-class neighborhood in an unidentified American town. Production designer Naomi Shohan likened the locale to Evanston, Illinois, but said, [...] "it's not about a place, it's about an archetype. The milieu was pretty much Anywhere, USA—upwardly mobile suburbia." [...] The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters, who are also archetypes. Shohan said, [...] "All of them are very strained, and their lives are constructs." [...] The Burnhams' household was designed as the reverse of the Fitts'—the former a pristine ideal, but graceless and lacking in [...] "inner balance", leading to Carolyn's desire to at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> it the appearance of a [...] "perfect all-American household"; the Fitts' home is depicted in [...] "exaggerated darkness [...] symmetry".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{reviewing}} the New York production generally gave it poor reviews. [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team's [...] "honorable intentions" [...] in bringing back a work {{thought to be}} [...] "terminally out-of-date", but felt both the new Mei-li and the show in general lacked personality. [...] Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it [...] "an entertaining, albeit vulgar revival", and Clive Barnes of the New York Post found it no more memorable than the earlier version. [...] The review in Talkin' Broadway is scathing, criticizing Hwang's use of the songs and characters, and the orchestrations, and commenting: [...] "Hwang's book lacks much of the charm, warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low road will do. ... Hwang {{felt it necessary to}} reduce the original, uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes." [...] Michael Kuchwara commented about Harvard in his lukewarm review for Associated Press: [...] "Then there's Linda Low's gay confidante, Harvard. [...] Talk about stereotypes. [...] If you are going to perpetuate one at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> him better jokes." [...] On the other hand, both USA Today and Time magazine gave it positive reviews. [...] The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom [...] "were able to keep numbers like 'Chop Suey' and milk it for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians." [...] Brantley disagreed, writing, [...] "because the show's satiric point of view is so muddled, there's no verve in such numbers, no joy in the performing of them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite The Suns {{celebration of}} Shipman's suicide, his death divided {{national}} newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a [...] "cold coward" [...] and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Independent, {{on the other}} hand, called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely {{at the state of}} Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.|$|E
2500|$|Neville Hawcock for the Financial Times praises Dawkins' {{clarity in}} {{explanation}}: [...] "He really {{is very good}} at this. The chapter on rainbows has the clearest explanation of how they appear that I’ve ever seen." [...] Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: [...] "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are not up to the job of accounting for reality but at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> McKean some great subject matter." [...] Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the Wall Street Journal says: [...] "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish your children to have of the cosmos, then The Magic of Reality will suit you very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{escape from}} English hands was aided by one Sir William Ramsay of Colluthie, also a {{prisoner}} of the English. In the presence {{of one of the}} guards, Ramsay pretended to be furious with Archibald and accused him of the theft of his cousin's armour. Furthermore, he stated that his cousin had been felled by an English arrow and had died as a [...] result of his lack of protection. Ramsay than insisted that Archibald take off his boots. Archibald concurred {{and by the time he}} had removed one, Ramsay started beating him around the head with it. One of the guards intervened to stop Ramsay, insisting that Archibald was the son of a great noble and should be respected. Ramsay retorted, [...] "Not he, I tell you, he is a scullion and a rogue", then to Archibald, [...] "Go you rascal, and seek your master's body amongst the slain, so that we may at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> him a decent burial". Ramsay paid the fee of 40 shillings, the ransomable rate of an esquire. Ramsay cuffed Archibald round the head once more and bade him begone. Archibald made his way back to Scotland, and deprived the Black Prince's army of what would have been a considerable ransom.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, on 5 July 1924, {{another group}} of army {{officers}} mounted a rebellion in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The date was chosen to honour the 1922 rebels; the uprising [...] "was better prepared and was intended {{to bring down the}} Bernardes government". The formal leader was retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with others including Eduardo Gomes, Newton Estillac Leal, João Cabanas and Miguel Costa. The rebellion began well, with control of São Paulo being secured after the governor and forces loyal to him abandoned the city early on 9 July. The rebels in the city were put under siege by government forces, and prevented from linking up with other uprisings which were breaking out in places such as Bela Vista, Mato Grosso, Aracaju, Sergipe and Manaus. The city was then subjected to a several-week artillery and aerial bombardment, of which civilians bore the brunt. On 26 July, army aircraft dropped leaflets over the city warning the remaining civilians to leave so that loyalist forces would have a free hand against the rebels. [...] "Isidoro's various attempts at securing an accord with the government that would at <b>least</b> <b>give</b> the rebels amnesty were rebuffed. The leaders understood that they would be wiped out, along with {{a good part of the}} city, if they stayed. On the night of 27 July they staged a careful withdrawal of 3,000 troops on thirteen trains, via the Northwest Railroad, toward Mato Grosso, where they hoped to hook up with sympathetic units". This withdrawal was executed so smoothly that it went unnoticed by the government forces until the morning. However, with their route to Mato Grosso blocked, the rebels retired to an area bordering Argentina and Paraguay close to Foz do Iguaçu.|$|E
