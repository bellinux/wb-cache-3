2500|$|In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy {{created the}} President's Committee on Corporate Pension Plans. The {{movement}} for pension reform gained some momentum when the Studebaker Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, closed its plant in 1963. Its pension plan was so poorly funded that Studebaker {{could not afford}} to provide all employees with their pensions. [...] The company created a program in which 3,600 workers who had reached the retirement age of 60 received full pension benefits, [...] 4,000 workers aged 40–59 who had ten years with Studebaker received <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>payments</b> valued at roughly 15% of the actuarial value of their pension benefits, and the remaining 2,900 workers received no pensions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, White {{encouraged}} the Canadian Membership of the U.A.W. to split {{away from the}} American union and form a new and separate entity, the Canadian Auto Workers Union (properly the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada). An important event {{in the history of}} the Canadian labour movement, this split took place largely because the Canadian delegates to the U.A.W. conventions felt that they did not have a strength or voice at the American conventions and that the American [...] "parent" [...] union was not doing enough in the way of protecting the Canadian workers. Specifically, the issue was centered on <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>payments</b> to hourly workers. This policy was accepted in the United States by the UAW president of the day, Owen Bieber, and he attempted to force it on the workers in Canada. This was at odds with Bob White's ideas on what was needed in Canada, namely annual base rate increases. The schism and the formation of the C.A.W. as a separate entity was successful and White was acclaimed as the first leader of the fledgling union at the first C.A.W. convention in 1985.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} for a consumer to imitate the methods of professional debt settlement companies and many people report success in negotiating a debt settlement for themselves. Initiation of negotiations can begin by calling the customer service department of the credit card company. In general, the credit card company will only deal with a consumer when the consumer is behind on payments but capable of making a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>payment.</b> A payment plan is not an option; the credit card company will demand that the consumer make a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>payment</b> of the settlement amount.|$|R

50|$|Legislation {{establishing}} {{the new tax}} was put before the parlements for registration in 1749 and was briefly though vociferously opposed.

50|$|The Act {{has led to}} Muslim women {{receiving}} a large, one-time payment from their husbands {{during the period of}} iddat, instead of a maximum monthly payment of 500 - an upper limit which has since been removed. Cases of women getting <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>payments</b> for lifetime maintenance are becoming common. However it is seen that despite its unique feature of no ceiling on quantum of maintenance, the Act is sparingly used {{because of the lack of}} its knowledge even among lawyers. The legal fraternity generally uses the CrPC provision while moving maintenance petitions, considering it handy.|$|E

Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.|$|E
