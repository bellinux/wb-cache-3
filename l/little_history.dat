5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>history</b> is {{available}} in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, castanets, and cymbals.|$|E

25|$|Before 1821, very <b>little</b> <b>history</b> {{had been}} {{recorded}} about the Holyoke Range that distinguished {{it from the}} surrounding landscape. Native Americans inhabited {{the area around the}} Holyoke Range for at least 10,000 years; they grew maize, tobacco, beans, squash and other crops in the Connecticut River floodplain, clearing small sections of forest by burning to make room for their crops. They hunted and fished in the area, and made tools and arrowheads from the basalt rock of the Metacomet Ridge. Tensions between the Pocumtuc Native American tribe and colonial settlers, who began arriving in the region in the mid 17th century, reached a head in 1675 with the outbreak of King Philip's War, a conflict involving colonists and a confederacy of Native American tribes across southern New England under the leadership of the sachem Metacomet. More settlers arrived after the war ended with the defeat of the Native Americans, and by the early 19th century, most of the region's current towns had been established and most of the land had been cleared of trees to make room for farms. Farmers were particularly attracted to the rich soils of the region—one of the few places in New England where tobacco can be grown with commercial success. Rugged highlands, such as the Holyoke Range and Mount Tom Range, although unsuitable for farming, were often harvested of timber to produce charcoal, a primary source of fuel for the steel industry prior to the extraction of coal in the mid-Appalachians. Highland areas were also burned of timber when lowland fires, set to clear land for farms, raged out of control. However, by the early 20th century, after agricultural interests shifted west and charcoaling became unprofitable, rural New England became largely forested again. A 2004 ecological resource study conducted for the National Park Service suggests that the Metacomet Ridge may have remained more or less forested (cleared only intermittently) throughout New England's agricultural period, thereby allowing the area to retain its biologic diversity through the 20th century.|$|E

In one much-quoted passage, Gilpin takes things to an extreme, suggesting that [...] "a mallet judiciously used" [...] might render the insufficiently ruinous gable of Tintern Abbey more picturesque. In the same work he criticises [...] John Dyer's description of the view from Grongar Hill for describing a distant object in too much detail.

[...] It's {{the story of}} [...] "Adam", {{one of the last}} surviving Homo habilis who is discovered in contemporary Georgia. [...] In this thematic companion to his novel No Enemy But Time (with an almost inverse conceit), Bishop tackles issues of racial and cultural prejudice, and explores the question {{of what it means to}} be human. Locus reviewer Debbie Notkin writes [...] "This is science fiction so precise and so well-thought-out that it reads like history, although <b>little</b> <b>history</b> is so well-written, or cares so much about its characters." [...] Bernard Goodman of Fantasy Review believes that [...] "Bishop's theme of evil inherent in humanity echoes William Golding," [...] and that the novel [...] "in some ways…parallels Golding's Lord of the Flies." [...] Author Samuel R. Delany writes [...] "A wonder-filled novel of ideas—ideas that include questions of race, science, art, and spirituality, among many others. Bishop dramatizes each of these with a panache and a narrative energy that are a delight to read and dazzling to watch." [...] Ancient of Days was nominated for the Arthur C.

In 1977, the Lucretia Hanson <b>Little</b> <b>History</b> Room in the library opened and became the base of operations for the Mill Valley Historical Society. [...] Marin County was hit with one of the worst droughts on record beginning in 1976 and peaking in 1977, brought on by a combination of several seasons of low rainfall and a refusal to import water from the Russian River, instead relying solely on rain water from Mt. Tam and the West Marin watersheds to fill the then-six reservoirs. [...] By June 1977, the County managed to pipe in water from the Sacramento River Delta, staving off disaster. [...] The rainfall during the winter of 1977-78 was one of the heaviest on record. The Mill Valley Film Festival, now part of the California Film Institute, began in 1978 at the Sequoia Theatre.|$|E
