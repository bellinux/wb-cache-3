5|$|Heavy rains caused <b>landslides</b> {{and flash}} flooding, which were {{responsible}} for extensive crop and property damage. Throughout the island of Shikoku, 14people were killed. In Mishima, two <b>landslides</b> claimed {{a total of four}} lives. Another landslide in Tsukude killed a 53-year old man, a 78-year old women, and a 14-year old girl. Hokkaido suffered the most severe flooding in 10years. Several major rivers on the island overflowed their banks, leaving towns inundated and isolated.

Achieving <b>landslide’s</b> 3 D dynamic simulation is helpful for the relevant regulatory authorities to guide the Prevention and Treatment of <b>landslide</b> disasters. For simulating <b>landslide</b> more intuitive and more realistic, and predicting the loss situation, we achieved <b>landslide’s</b> 3 D dynamic simulation based on <b>landslide</b> information extraction, modeling, finite element subdivision, and applying motion-displacement equation.

40|$|In August 2009, Typhoon Morakot struck Taiwan {{and brought}} a high-intensity, long {{duration}} and wide range rainfall. A series of natural hazards such as <b>landslide,</b> debris flow, flood and <b>landslide</b> dam were triggered by the rainfall. Among these natural disasters, the information of <b>landslide</b> lake and <b>landslide</b> dam cannot be obtained immediately through field investigations due to the remote location of <b>landslide</b> dams and severe weather condition. Furthermore, an appropriate response guideline to <b>landslide</b> dam is still not available in the emergency disposal plan of <b>landslide</b> lake.

30|$|To {{effectively}} mitigate <b>landslide</b> hazards, {{real-time simulation}} and forecast of rainfall-triggered <b>landslide</b> potential during a storm event are both urgent and necessary. Piciullo et al. (2018) categorize <b>landslide</b> early warning systems, {{according to the}} scale of analysis, into local and territorial systems. The former addresses <b>landslide</b> failure at a slope scale whereas the latter covers over a wide area at regional scale. In terms of methods for <b>landslide</b> early warning, van Westen et al. (2006) categorized the methods into three types including heuristic, statistical and deterministic methods. Heuristic methods are based on <b>landslide</b> records in a region by directly correlating pertinent <b>landslide</b> instigating factors with the <b>landslide</b> potential through some empirical relationships. Thus, the <b>landslide</b> instigating factors used can be different from region to region and from one expert to another. Heuristic methods, in general, are relatively simple to use, but involve significant subjectivity in judgement. Hence, <b>landslide</b> prediction for a slope by a heuristic method can vary by different experts.|$|R
