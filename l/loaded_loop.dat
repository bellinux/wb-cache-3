For the circuit modeling the general strategy {{to characterize the}} nonlinearly loaded antenna by a linear and a nonlinear circuit part is pursued. The linear circuit part can be determined by standard methods of antenna theory and numerical field computation. The modeling of the nonlinear circuit part requires realistic circuit models of the nonlinear loads that are given by Schottky diodes. Combining both parts, appropriate circuit models are obtained and analyzed {{by means of a}} standard SPICE circuit simulator. It is the main result that in this way full-wave simulation results can be reproduced. Furthermore it is clearly seen that the equivalent circuit modeling offers considerable advantages with respect to computation speed and also leads to improved physical insights regarding the coupling between HPEM field excitation and nonlinearly <b>loaded</b> <b>loop</b> antenna...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we designed, measured, and {{analyzed}} a rearranged L-shape magnetic resonance coupling {{wireless power transfer}} (MRWPT) system for practical applications with laptops. The typical four resonator MR-WPT (Tx part: source loop and Tx coil; Rx part: Rx coil and <b>load</b> <b>loop)</b> is difficult to apply to small-sized stationary and mobile applications, such as laptop computers, tablet-PCs, and smartphones, owing to the large volume of the Rx part and the spatial restrictions of the Tx and Rx coils. Therefore, an L-shape structure, which is the orthogonal arrangement of the Tx and Rx parts, is proposed for indoor environment applications, such as at an Lshaped wall or desk. The relatively large Tx part and Rx coil can be installed in {{the wall and the}} desk, respectively, while the <b>load</b> <b>loop</b> is embedded in the small stationary or mobile devices.

The analyzed structures {{are based on}} the coupling of IDCLLRs to a conventional 50 Ω microstrip transmission line. We have firstly studied the frequency response of one-stage IDCLLR-loaded microstrip transmission line. The main fratures of the IDCLLRs are small dimensions (much smaller than the wavelength at resonance) and more structural parameters (provide flexibility in design); Then a 6 -stage IDCLLR-based microstip band-reject filter was designed and fabricated, it performs relative rejection bandwidth of 8. 1 % and rejection level of 23 dB. This stop-band is resulted from presence of the artificial medium with negative effective permeability (μeff < 0). In addition, it is easy to control the rejection bandwidth by only employing different length of inter-digital fingers (for multiple tuning). A 9 -stage band-reject filter with multiple tuned IDCLLRs has been fabricated and tested, its relative rejection bandwidth is extended to 11. 5 %.

40|$|The theory, design, analysis, and {{verification}} of a wideband and unidirectional <b>loop</b> antenna <b>loaded</b> with mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial unit cells is presented. It is shown that by nonperiodic positioning of MNG unit cells on the loop structure, the amplitude {{of the surface}} current can be modified in a desired section of the loop, and hence, unidirectional radiation is achievable at the mu-zero resonance frequency. Moreover, it is demonstrated {{that as a result}} of the capacitive MNG loading, a 90 ° phase difference occurs between the vertical arms of the loop. Therefore, its radiation mechanism can be characterized as an array of two dipole antennas positioned a quarter wavelength apart, thus creating unidirectional radiation. To further improve the performance of the antennas, a quarter-wavelength strip is located in the vicinity of the loop to act as a resonator and director at higher frequencies.

40|$|Tunka-Rex, the Tunka radio extension, is {{an array}} of 20 antennas at the Tunka {{experiment}} close to Lake Baikal in Siberia. It started operation on 08 October 2012. The antennas are connected directly to the data acquisition of the Tunka main detector, a 1 km 2 large array of 133 non-imaging photomultipliers observing the Cherenkov light of air showers in dark and clear nights. This allows to cross-calibrate the radio signal with the air-Cherenkov signal of the same air showers - in particular {{with respect to the}} energy and the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, X max. Consequently, we can test whether in rural regions with low radio background the practically achievable radio precision comes close to the precision of the established fluorescence and air-Cherenkov techniques. At a mid-term perspective, due to its higher duty-cycle, Tunka-Rex can enhance the effective observing time of Tunka by an order of magnitude, at least in the interesting energy range above 100 PeV. Moreover, Tunka-Rex is very cost-effective, e. g., by using economic Short Aperiodic <b>Loaded</b> <b>Loop</b> Antennas (SALLAs). Thus, the results of Tunka-Rex and the comparison to other sophisticated radio arrays will provide crucial input for future large-scale cosmic-ray observatories, for which measurement precision as well as costs per area have to be optimized.

40|$|Abstract—A simple {{theory is}} {{presented}} to predict the lumped reactance loading for circularly polarized circular loop antennas with a uniform traveling-wave current distribution. The reactive load is located on a circular wire loop of one-wavelength circumference at a position of 45 away from the feed point. To achieve a uniform traveling-wave current distribution, the loading reactance and the input impedances of the loaded and unloaded loop antennas need to satisfy certain conditions. First, the input resistance and the input reactance of the unloaded loop antenna {{should have the same}} absolute value. Second, the input impedance of the <b>loaded</b> <b>loop</b> must be purely resistive and its value needs to be two times of the input resistance of the unloaded loop. Third, the loading reactance should be chosen to be two times in value and opposite in sense of the input reactance of the unloaded loop. These conditions can be approximately met when the circular loop is placed above a ground plane. The loading reactance is determined from the input impedance of the unloaded loop and is optimized for an optimal performance of circular polarization. It is found that the reactive load must be capacitive and its value depends on the height of the loop above the ground plane and the thickness of the wire. The characteristics of the circular polarization and the input impedance of the capacitance-loaded circular loop antennas are investigated. An experimental example {{is presented to}} verify the theoretical prediction.

40|$|Wireless medical implant {{powering}} is {{an emerging}} sector for future healthcare applications. It enhances the healthcare safety {{level and the}} prospects of a better life. The main theme {{of this research is}} to design a wireless power budgeting for the medical implants. A proper link between an external source to the implant is established by an inductive coupling for a particular physiological parameter monitoring. A battery-free implant device requires sufficient power supply for active monitoring. The main target of this research is to develop a wearable and external antenna design for transferring sufficient power to the implant for its activation without violating the regulations of specific absorption rate limits. In addition, there is another goal of improving the implant depth. In this research, two different models (link model and SAR model) are used for the assessment in the virtual environment. Previously, a two-turns antenna is used for power transmission but in this research, several antenna structures are studied such as – the circular two-turns with a capacitor <b>loaded</b> <b>loop,</b> benzene shape, rectangular shape, octagonal shape, and circular spiral shape. Among these structures, circular spiral shape, with the combination of same and counter directions of spiral loops, shows satisfactory results. Through the proper optimization approach, the circular spiral antenna is capable of providing 25 % more power at the implant with respect to the two-turns antenna. For 16 mm link distance, the circular spiral antenna can transmit 686 mW whereas a two-turns antenna is efficient up to 452 mW. Even the implant can be placed 2. 5 mm more depth without interrupting the power transmission link between antennas. The circular spiral antenna is able to transfer significant power up to 9 mm skull thickness whereas 6. 4 mm is the average width. Two experimental setups are developed for antenna performance analysis such as “air gap testing”, and “pigskin and air gap testing”. In the experiments, the effect of parasitic elements over the link power efficiency is identical to both the experiments. The results of “in vitro” testing of the newly developed wearable external antenna inspires for future implementation in the monitoring of intracranial pressure. From the performance analysis, in both the virtual environment and experimental setup, the circular spiral antenna has enough potentiality to use in inductive powering for further research and development...|$|E
40|$|While double {{negative}} (DNG) metamaterials (MTMs) were proposed over forty years ago, {{they have been}} experimentally demonstrated {{only in the last}} decade. The adaptation of a variety of epsilon-negative (ENG), mu-negative (MNG), and {{double negative}} (DNG) metamaterials, as well as single ENG, MNG,and DNG MTM unit cells, to achieve antenna systems exhibiting enhanced performance characteristics has received considerable research attention. These include, for example, electrically small antennas, multi-functional antennas, leaky-wave antenna arrays, and higher directivity antennas. Inspired by these metamaterial concepts, several metamaterial-engineered antennas have been investigated in this dissertation to achieve additional enhanced performance characteristics. First, several fabricated and tested variations of the three dimensional (3 D) magnetic EZ (easy) antenna at 300 MHz and 100 MHz were examined. The 3 D magnetic EZ antenna is composed of an electrically small loop antenna that is coaxially-fed through a finite ground plane and that is integrated with an extruded capacitively <b>loaded</b> <b>loop</b> (CLL) element. This 3 D CLL structure is designed to be a near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) element. With the proper placement of the NFRP element in the very near field of the driven element, it was demonstrated that the overall antenna system achieved complete matching to the source without any external matching network, along with an enhancement of the overall radiation efficiency. Additionally, multi-functional 3 D magnetic EZ antennas were designed for wireless communication applications. For instance, by incorporating multiple NFRP elements, several dual-band versions were realized. Second, by properly combining and phasing their effective magnetic dipoles, electrically small multi-band, circular polarized (CP), metamaterial-inspired wire antennas were perfected that are nearly completely matched to a 50 Ω source and have high radiation efficiencies. Again, they were accomplished by incorporating multiple NFRP elements into their designs. Finally, two tri-band-notched UWB antennas were developed and tested successfully. The notched filters were achieved by introducing printed, electrically small CLL resonators into the UWB antenna design. Each CLL element has a high-Q characteristic and a compact size, which made it a very suitable candidate for a band-stop filter function. Like the split ring resonator (SRR) element, the CLL element is self-resonant and has a resonance frequency that is determined primarily by its loop inductance and the capacitances resulting from the cuts which opened the loop. In contrast, the CLL element has a much simpler, more compact design. It was demonstrated that by placing one, two or three CLL elements near the feedline of the UWB antenna and by tuning their sizes, one can control the band-notched frequencies of the radiator, while minimizing their space requirements, to achieve single, dual, and tri-band notched-filter UWB antennas...|$|E

40|$|The pulse {{receiving}} {{characteristics of}} several thin-wire antennas {{have been investigated}} in this thesis. First, a loop antenna with a uniformly distributed impedance has been investigated, analytically, in the frequency domain. An equivalent circuit has been developed for the impedance-loaded loop antenna receiving an arbitrary steady-state electromagnetic field. The frequency- and time-domain receiving characteristics of a resistively <b>loaded</b> <b>loop</b> antenna have been obtained. It {{has been found that}} the loop antenna with a uniform distributed resistance has a broad receiving bandwidth. Nonetheless, the antenna is dispersive and is therefore not suitable for the reception of electromagnetic pulses or transients. Second, pulse-receiving characteristics of resistively loaded straight dipole antennas have been investigated in the time domain. Frequency-domain receiving characteristics have been obtained using the Fast Fourier Transform method. Two types of resistively loaded straight dipole antenna designs have been considered. One design has a high distributed resistance and a low terminal resistance, and gives a broad bandwidth {{at the expense of the}} sensitivity. The other design has a low distributed resistance and a high terminal resistance. It does not sacrifice the sensitivity but requires an active high-impedance receiver circuit. It has been found that the Wu-King resistively loaded dipole has the maximally flat frequency response close to the upper roll-off frequency, when terminated with a high-impedance load. Third, a time-domain stepping-in-time procedure has been developed for the analysis of unloaded and resistively loaded V-antennas. V-antennas with various terminations have also been analyzed using the Numerical Electromagnetic Code. After identifying the limitations of resistively loaded straight and V-antennas in receiving fast pulses and transients, a passive compensation technique has been developed to significantly increase the upper frequency limit of the V-antenna. The new V-antenna consists of a resistively-loaded thin-wire V-dipole or monopole, a Response Equalizer Circuit and an oscilloscope probe (or other termination). For a given termination, the new antenna has a higher sensitivity and a much broader bandwidth compared with the Wu-King antenna. It is estimated to have a 3 -dB bandwidth from 25 MHz to 10 GHz when used with a commercially available 500 Ω passive probe. The sensitivity is approximately 1 mV/(Vm- 1), taking into account the 20 dB attenuation of the probe. With a 50 Ω probe, this antenna has a 3 -dB bandwidth from 110 MHz to 10 GHz, and a sensitivity better than 4 mV/(Vm- 1). A V-antenna and a Wu-King monopole antenna have been fabricated using thin-film deposition technology. A time-domain antenna range has been built and used to measure the time-domain response of the experimental antennas. It has been found that the experimental V-antenna is capable of receiving a 520 -ps approximately Gaussian pulse, without significant distortions. The frequency-domain receiving characteristics of the two antennas have been obtained using the Fast Fourier Transform method. The receiving response of the V-antenna has been measured in the frequency domain, using a TEM cell and network analyzers. The experimental thin-film V-antenna has a sensitivity of 1. 12 mV/(Vm- 1) and a flat receiving response from 35 MHz to 3 GHz. It was not possible to measure the response beyond 3 GHz, due to limitations of the pulse generators available. The experimental thin-film Wu-King antenna has a sensitivity of 22 mV/(Vm- 1) and an upper roll-off frequency of about 300 MHz, which is limited by the bandwidth of the active receiver circuit...|$|E
