40|$|Abstract. Motivated by a {{frequency}} assignment problem in cellular networks, we introduce and study a new coloring {{problem that we}} call minimum conflict-free coloring (min-CF-coloring). In its general form, the input of the min-CF-coloring problem is a set system (X, S), where each S ∈S is a subset of X. The output is a coloring χ of the sets in S that satisfies the following constraint: for every x ∈ X there exists a color i and a unique set S ∈Ssuch that x ∈ S and χ(S) =i. The goal is to minimize the number of colors used by the coloring χ. Min-CF-coloring of general set systems is not easier than the classic graph coloring problem. However, in view of our motivation, we consider set systems induced by simple geometric regions in the plane. In particular, we study disks (both congruent and noncongruent), axis-parallel rectangles (with a constant ratio between the smallest and <b>largest</b> rectangle), regular <b>hexagons</b> (with a constant ratio between the smallest and <b>largest</b> <b>hexagon),</b> and general congruent centrally symmetric convex regions in the plane. In all cases we have coloring algorithms that use O(log n) colors (where n {{is the number of}} regions). Tightness is demonstrated by showing that even in the case of unit disks, Θ(log n) colors may be necessary. For rectangles and hexagons we also obtain a constant-ratio approximation algorithm when the ratio between the largest and smallest rectangle (hexagon) is a constant. We also consider a dual problem of CF-coloring points with respect to sets. Given a set system (X, S), the goal in the dual problem is to color the elements in X with a minimum number of colors so that every set S ∈Scontains a point whose color appears only once in S. We show that O(log |X|) colors suffice for set systems in which X is a set of points in the plane and the sets are intersections of X with scaled translations of a convex region. This result is used in proving that O(log n) colors suffice in the primal version...|$|R

40|$|The {{plethora of}} ice {{structures}} observed both in bulk and under nanoscale confinement reflects the extraordinary ability of water molecules to form diverse forms of hydrogen bonding networks. An ideal hydrogen bonding network of water should satisfy three requirements: (1) four hydrogen bonds connected with every water molecule, (2) nearly linear hydrogen bonds, and (3) tetrahedral configuration {{for the four}} hydrogen bonds around an O atom. However, under nanoscale confinement, some of the three requirements have to be unmet, and {{the selection of the}} specific requirement(s) leads to different types of hydrogen bonding structures. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for water confined between two smooth hydrophobic walls, we obtain a phase diagram of three two-dimensional (2 D) crystalline structures and a bilayer liquid. A new 2 D bilayer ice is found and named the interlocked pentagonal bilayer ice (IPBI), because its side view comprises interlocked pentagonal channels.

However, there are fundamental differences between the two bilayer structures due to the difference in the selection among the three requirements. The IPBI sacrifices the linearity of hydrogen bonds to retain locally tetrahedral configurations of the hydrogen bonds, whereas the coffin structure does the opposite.

The size of this waste product, which is under development, is such {{that many of them}} will fit into one of the large cylindrical containers being considered for use at the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada. A key concern is how to size the waste cylinders and arrange them inside the container so that the space within the container is efficiently used and ceramic temperatures above about 600 C are not reached. The waste cylinders are all the same size and are uniformly arranged in layers on a triangular pitch. A layer is formed by placing a number of waste cylinders together and orienting {{them as if they were}} cans sitting on a shelf.

40|$|In {{the model}} {{presented}} here, {{in the dark}} any single quantum absorption in a rod or cone produces a subliminal excitation. Subliminal excitations from both halves of a twin unit pair in the retina for the perception {{of light from the}} stimulus. A twin unit contains either two red or two green cones. The twin units are intertwined in triples of two red units and one green unit in a hexagon called a trion. P satellite rods surround each cone, P being approximately proportional to the square of eccentricity. A successful pairing for light perception represents - through the points of time and locations of the creation of its partners in the retina - a direction event with two possible polarities and with the orientation of the elongated shape of the twin unit. The polarity of the event depends on which of the two partners arrives first at the twin's pairing facility. Simultaneous events and successive events with the same polarity in adjacent units that are aligned along one of the three orientations of the hexagonal retinal mosaic pair in the cortex for the perception of edge and of movement. Inter-twin pairing products of the three differently oriented sets of aligned twins are independent of each other and sum vectorially in the cortex. This system of three sub-retinas is called the retrinet. Two one-quantum excitations in any of a twin's receptors make the percept colored. The odd blue cone produces already a blue signal for a single one-quantum excitation. Intra-receptor pairing in a rod, a red cone and a green cone is for white, red, and green respectively. Red and green cone products of a trion cross-pair in the retina and produce a yellow signal. Red and green cone products of a hexagon of adjacent trions cross-pair in the cortex and produce a white signal. This <b>large</b> <b>hexagon</b> with a total of seven trions is called a persepton. After subliminal excitations in a twin have paired successfully, further subliminal receptor excitations in neighboring and aligned twins are expressed to a certain extent in the percept's area, duration and color.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) shows that desorption of NiF 2 and I increases linearly with CF 3 I exposure until reaching a saturation level. A small amount of CF 3 desorption is detected as the exposure approaches saturation, indicating that adsorbed CF 3 is stabilized as the surface sites required for decomposition become less available;Electron-induced decomposition (EID) of multilayer CF 3 I occurs with a cross-section of 1. 5 x 10 - 16 cm 2. F+ is the dominant product detected during electron irradiation. A number of new thermal desorption products are observed following electron irradiation. Of particular interest is a series of carbon-carbon bond formation products likely produced in the multilayer as a result of EID. The mechanism through which these products form may mimic the proposed electron-induced cross-linking of fluoropolymer chains;Exposure of CF 3 I to Ru(001) at 100 K results in a complex mixture of CF n (n = 2 - 4) thermal desorption products. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and H 2 coadsorption experiments suggest that the reactions which lead to these desorption products are regulated by the availability of surface sites.

The inclusion of equilateral <b>hexagons</b> into the <b>larger</b> class of <b>hexagons</b> with arbitrary edge length maps hexagonal knot types bijectively; however the kernel of this inclusion at the level of fundamental group is shown to be non-trivial. In addition, combinatorial invariants are developed to distinguish between the five different “hexagonal knot types”, giving a complete classification of hexagonal knots...|$|R
5000|$|Culture {{techniques}} and media vary {{depending upon the}} requirements of the fungal isolate involved, however the general procedure consist of the following: fungal hyphae are typically placed in liquid growth media and placed in shake culture until the fungal culture has increased in biomass. The fungal hyphae are removed from the growth media, washed with distilled water to remove the growth media, placed in distilled water and incubated on shake culture for 24 to 48 hours. The fungal hyphae are separated from the supernatant, and an aliquot of the supernatant is added to 1.0 mM ion solution. The ion solution is then monitored for 2 to 3 days for the formation of nanoparticles. Another common culture technique is to add washed fungal hyphae directly into 1.0 mM ion solution instead of utilizing the fungal filtrate. Silver nitrate is the most widely used source of silver ions, but silver sulfate has also been utilized. Choloroauric acid is generally used as the source of gold ions at various concentrations (1.0 mM and 250 mg to 500 mg of Au per liter). Cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis for F. oxysporum was conducted using a 1:1 ratio of Cd2+ and SO42− at a 1 mM concentration. Gold nanoparticles can vary in shape and size depending on the pH of the ion solution. Gericke and Pinches (2006) reported that for V. luteoalbum small (cc.10 nm) spherical gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 3, <b>larger</b> (spherical, triangular, <b>hexagon</b> and rods) gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 5, and at pH 7 to pH 9 the large nanoparticles tend to lack a defined shape. Soni and Prakash (2011) reported an opposite response to pH for silver nanoparticles synthesized by both C. tropicum and F. oxysporum. [...] The authors concluded that silver nanoparticle size increased as the pH of the ion solution decreased. Temperature interactions for both silver and gold nanoparticles were similar; a lower temperature resulted in larger nanoparticles while higher temperatures produced smaller nanoparticles.|$|R
