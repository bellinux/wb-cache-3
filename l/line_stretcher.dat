50|$|The Irish {{troops of}} the 16th and 36th Divisions made a shoulder-to-shoulder {{successful}} advance in the great attack on the Messines Ridge towards the small village of Wytschaete (now Wijtschate) next to Messines. On going over the top Redmond, leading his men, {{was one of the}} first out of the trenches. He was hit by German defensive fire almost immediately in the wrist, and then further on in the leg, falling to the ground he urged his men on as they flowed forward about him towards the German <b>line.</b> <b>Stretcher</b> bearers from the 36th (Ulster) Division, one of them Private John Meeke of the 11th Inniskillings, who was himself wounded, brought him back into the British lines from No Man's Land, and he was conveyed to a Casualty Clearing Station at the Catholic Hospice at Locre (now Loker) in Dranoutre. Redmond died there from his wounds later that afternoon.|$|E
40|$|A novel CPW-to-stripline {{post coupler}} is demonstrated. This device couples the output power from a coax-to-CPW inphase seven-way radial power divider to a {{balanced}} stripline <b>line</b> <b>stretcher</b> and together forms a multilayer probe-type feed network. The feed network excites a seven-patch hexagonal circularly polarized (CP) subarray. The measured return loss and insertion loss of the coupler are better than 17 dB and 0. 25 dB at the design frequency of 2. 875 GHz. The measured on-axis axial ratio for the left hand circular polarization (LHCP) is 1. 5 dB and the 3 dB beam widths are 36 deg in the principal planes of the subarray. The gain of the subarray is 13 dB. The input return loss of the subarray is better than 10 dB...|$|E

25|$|Raking {{courses in}} monk bond may—for instance—be {{staggered}} {{in such a}} way as to generate the appearance of diagonal <b>lines</b> of <b>stretchers.</b> One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of <b>lines</b> of <b>stretchers</b> running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.|$|R

40|$|A novel high-gain textile {{antenna array}} system, fully {{integrated}} into a rescue-worker’s vest and operating in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical wireless band (2. 4 – 2. 4835 [*]GHz), is presented. The system comprises an array consisting of four tip-truncated equilateral triangular microstrip patch antennas (ETMPAs), a power divider, <b>line</b> <b>stretchers,</b> and coaxial cables. The array is vertically positioned on the human torso to produce a narrow beam in elevation, as such reducing fading and allowing to steer the maximum gain in a small angular sector centered around the broadside direction. To allow simple low-cost beam steering, we specifically minimize mutual coupling by using a relative large distance between the patches and by selecting the ETMPA element as the most suited topology from three potential patch geometries. Moreover, we investigate the stability of return loss and mutual coupling characteristics under different relative humidity conditions, when bending the array, when placing the system on-body, and when covering it by different textile layers. Reflection coefficient and gain patterns are simulated and measured for the antenna system in free space and placed on the human body...|$|R

40|$|Two new four-element {{fast wave}} current drive antennas have been {{installed}} on DIII-D. These antennas {{are designed for}} 10 -s pulses at 2 MW each in the frequency range of 30 to 120 MHz. Each element comprises two poloidal segments fed in parallel in order to optimize plasma coupling at {{the upper end of}} the frequency range. The antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the vacuum vessel, in ports designated 0 {degrees} and 180 {degrees} after their toroidal angle. Each antenna array is fed by a single transmitter. The power is first split two ways by means of a 3 -dB hybrid coupler, then each of these lines feeds a resonant loop connecting a pair of array elements. The power transfer during asymmetric phasing is shunted between resonant loops by a decoupler. The resonant loops are fitted with <b>line</b> <b>stretchers</b> so that multiple frequencies of operation are possible without reconfiguring the transmission line. Commissioning of these antennas has been underway since June 1994. Several deficiencies in the transmission line system were uncovered during initial vacuum conditioning, including problems with the transmission line insulators and with the drive rods for the variable elements. The former was solved by replacing the original alumina insulators, and the latter has been avoided during operation to date by positioning the tuners to avoid high voltage appearing on the drive rods. A modified design for the drive rods will be implemented before RF operations resume operation June 1995. New transmitters were procured from ABB for the new antennas and were installed in parallel with the antenna installation. During initial vacuum conditioning of the antenna in the 180 {degree} port a fast digital oscilloscope was used to try to pinpoint the location of arcing by a time-of-flight technique and to develop an understanding of the typical arc signature in the system...|$|R
2500|$|The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment's advance was {{slowed by}} strong Japanese {{reinforcements}} as it {{closed in on}} the objective. Calling down 60mm and 81mm mortar fire {{in front of their}} positions, the American troops regained the initiative and moved forward. Although the remaining Japanese made a determined final stand on the objective, the Marines were able to push ahead and as the resistance subsided the battalion [...] "mopped up" [...] before establishing a defensive night position. In the US rear area, behind the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, sporadic fighting continued during the night as small pockets of Japanese troops, which had been bypassed during the US assault, attacked the Marines' supply <b>lines,</b> ambushing <b>stretcher</b> bearers and troops bringing up ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the Civil War, {{the various}} Communist {{newspapers}} {{engaged in a}} massive propaganda campaign against the anarchists and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). They were often called [...] "Hitlerites" [...] and [...] "fascists" [...] in the pay of Franco, as George Orwell notes in Homage to Catalonia: [...] "Just imagine how odious it must be to see a young 15-year-old Spaniard brought back from the front <b>lines</b> on a <b>stretcher,</b> to see, poking {{out from under the}} blanket an anemic, bewildered face and to think that in London and Paris there are gentlemen dressed to the nines, blithely engaged in writing pamphlets to show this little lad is a covert fascist." [...] The unreliability of these newspapers peaked when not even one reported the events of May 1937.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} major {{achievements}} of the physics/engineering design effort {{and the construction of}} the PHELIX laser, which will be capable of producing pulses up to a peak power of one PW (10 15 W) in 500 fs and 400 GW in 10 ns. One of the main technological challenges in the production of high-energy petawatt (HEPW) pulses is the reduction of the peak power on today's highest damage threshold laser components (some GW/cm 2). The enabling technological advancement which reduces the intensity in the high-energy laser amplifier of PHELIX by a factor of 30, 000 and thus avoids catastrophic damage as well as deleterious nonlinear effects is chirped pulse amplification (CPA) [1, 2]. In the front-end section of PHELIX, a low-energy (~nJ), 15 nm bandwidth seed-pulse is passed through a positivedispersion delay <b>line</b> (grating <b>stretcher).</b> This produces out of the 110 fs oscillator pulse a three ns duration chirped pulse which is then amplified at an irradiance well below the self-focusing threshold. After amplification in the main amplifier to ~ 650 J, the high-energy chirped pulse will be recompressed by a pair of parallel diffraction gratings to ~ 500 fs. The emerging technology of multi-layer dielectric (MLD) gratings is believed to offer a substantial improvement of the laser induced damage threshold (LDT) compared to the traditional meter size gold coated gratings [3, 4]. In cooperation with LLE Rochester in the US and LULI in France, we spent significant effort for the investigation of the LDT o...|$|R
50|$|Although the French {{had made}} some {{progress}} in the afternoon's fighting, their casualties had been disconcertingly high, {{and it was not}} clear whether the brigade was strong enough to break through on the following morning. According to Lieutenant Huguet of Lambinet's marine infantry battalion, both Brière de l'Isle and Giovanninelli had been shaken by the ferocity of the enemy's resistance and were contemplating the possibility of defeat:The general-in-chief was sitting behind a bank, anxious, his head in his hands, surrounded by his staff, perhaps wondering whether he would have to retreat. Colonel Giovanninelli, who valued the life of the humblest soldier as dearly as his own, was pale and shaken as he watched the <b>lines</b> of bloodstained <b>stretchers</b> file past him, and kept exclaiming in a strangled voice, 'My children! My poor children!' The bullets whistled incessantly in the close air, and the groans of the wounded men lying in the rose bushes, inside the bamboo groves, and against the sides of the enemy works, rose ever more distinctly.|$|R
50|$|For {{efficient}} {{handling and}} laying, bricks must be small enough and {{light enough to}} be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100 mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200 mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid bonded in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in English bond, at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of stretchers, bricks laid longways, and headers, bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of English bond called English cross bond where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true English bond, the perpendicular <b>lines</b> of the <b>stretcher</b> courses are in line with each other.|$|R
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from November 28, to December 2, 1950. Assigned to defend a three-mile mountain pass along the division's main supply line and commanding the only route of approach in the march from Yudam-Ni to Hagaru-ri, Captain Barber took position with his battle weary troops and, before nightfall, had dug in and set up a defense along the frozen snow-covered hillside. When a force of estimated regimental strength savagely attacked during the night, inflicting heavy casualties and finally surrounding his position following a bitterly fought seven-hour conflict, Captain Barber, after repulsing the enemy, gave assurance that he could hold if supplied by air drops and requested permission to stand fast when orders were received by radio to fight his way back to a relieving force after two reinforcing units had been driven back under fierce resistance in their attempts to reach the isolated troops. Aware that leaving the position would sever contact with the 8,000 Marines trapped at Yudam-ni and jeopardize their chances of joining the 3,000 more awaiting their arrival in Hagaru-ri for the continued drive to the sea, he chose to risk loss of his command rather than sacrifice more men if the enemy seized control and forced a renewed battle to regain the position, or abandon his many wounded who were unable to walk. Although severely wounded in the leg the early morning of the 29th, Captain Barber continued to maintain personal control, often moving up and down the <b>lines</b> on a <b>stretcher</b> to direct the defense and consistently encouraging and inspiring his men to supreme efforts despite the staggering opposition. Waging desperate battle throughout five days and six nights of repeated onslaughts launched by the fanatical aggressors, he and his heroic command accounted for approximately 1,000 enemy dead in this epic stand in bitter sub-zero weather, and when the company was relieved, only 82 of his original 220 men were able to walk away from the position so valiantly defended against insuperable odds. His profound faith and courage, great personal valor and unwavering fortitude were decisive factors in the successful withdrawal of the division from the deathtrap in the Chosin Reservoir sector and reflect the highest credit upon Captain Barber, his intrepid officers and men and the United States Naval Service.|$|R
