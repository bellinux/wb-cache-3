50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{manufacturing}} fishcakes, according to Singaporean fishcake production, fish meats are first defrosted and then ground. After the grinding process, fish meats and all ingredients needed are blended together at high speed. Normally, salt, sugar, flour, and starch are necessarily added to mashed fish fillets. It is good to add salt which approximately weighs 3% of the fish fillets’ weight. Also, other ingredients such as vegetables (onions, carrots, or green onions) or chemicals such as MSG can be added for a better flavor only if the ingredients are suitable for the <b>local</b> <b>requirement.</b> Next, the fish paste is formed {{so that it can}} be baked or deep-fried. In order to properly preserve fishcake product, during the process of baking or frying, eradication of enzymes and microorganisms is necessary using heat. For instance, Canada has a specific regulation that the fish cakes should be heated to 65°C for one minute to destroy the salmonella that may be present. After fishcakes are finally filtered, it is sent for packing and it is now ready to deliver.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore how}} Swedish Local Planning Authorities {{perceive}} standardized housing construction {{and attempt to}} use an ideal type typology of institutional logics to describe how Local Planning Authorities {{make use of the}} multiple institutional logics available to them. Increased standardization in Swedish housing construction has been suggested as a means to meet the growing need for housing with reasonable rent levels. However, housing contractors that use standardization and repetition of processes and components claim that the variation of requirements set by Local Planning Authorities prevents them from taking full advantage of their standardization. A recent empirical study of standardized housing contractors’ perceptions suggests that <b>Local</b> <b>Requirement</b> Setting, the requirement setting practices of Local Planning Authorities, are interpretational responses to a lack of familiarity with standardized housing construction. Yet, Local Planning Authorities’ perceptions of standardized housing construction have never previously been explored. Empirical material for this on-going study was collected through in-depth exploratory interviews with local planning officers from three municipalities situated in Swedish population growth regions. Findings suggest that Local Planning Authorities perceive potential benefits with standardization, but ultimately expect standardized housing concepts to adapt to local standards for processes and products. In projects with high ambitions for architectural quality standardized housing concepts need to be highly flexible. Conversely, highly standardized housing concepts benefit from project ambitions that favour reasonable rent levels. Therefore, <b>Local</b> <b>Requirement</b> Setting is indicative of a mismatch between the Local Planning Authority’s project ambitions and the standardized housing contractor’s degree of product standardization.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{equivalence}} of three ways of expressing a certain strong consistency constraint [...] called the fulfilment constraint [...] on proofs of {{the logic of}} reusable propositional output: as a global requirement on proofs, as a <b>local</b> <b>requirement</b> on labels of formulas, and by phasing of proof rules. More specifically, we first show that the fulfilment constraint may be expressed either as a requirement on the historical structure of the proof tree or as a requirement on the contents of labels attached to its nodes. Second, we show that labelled proofs may be rewritten into a tightly phased form in which rules are applied in a fixed order. Third, we show that when a proof is in such a phased form, the consistency check on labels becomes redundant. Keywords: input-output logics, qualitative decision theory, deontic logic 1.

We study in detail three concrete functions µ (thenumberofverticesinthecluster,numberofnonedgesinthecluster,maximumnumberof non-neighbors a vertex has in the cluster), which correspond to natural clustering problems. For these functions, we show that (µ,p,q) -Partition can be solved in time 2 O(p) · n O(1) and in time 2 O(q) ·n O(1) on n-vertex graphs, i. e., the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by p or by q. ...|$|E
