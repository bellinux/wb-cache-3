40|$|The {{release of}} {{molecules}} adsorbed on {{the surfaces of}} amorphous carbon blacks has been studied using <b>liquid-solid</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Adsorbate molecules, adsorbents, and mobile phases were {{selected on the basis}} of their relevance as models for the release of toxic agents adsorbed on inhalable environmental particulate matter that originates from the incomplete combustion of organic materials. The presence of surface active groups on the carbon blacks has been shown to adsorb and retain adsorbate molecules selectively, and this selectivity can be reduced by competition for these active groups by the displacing solvent. Release is also governed by the surface coverage of the particles and increases as coverage approaches the monolayer...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{separation}} and purification of three turmerones from the turmeric oil extracted by {{supercritical carbon dioxide}}. Nearly, 800 g of supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of 75 g of 0. 42 mm turmeric powders at 333 K and 300 bar obtained 6. 98 wt% turmeric oil within 2. 5 h. A response-surface methodology is adopted for optimizing supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to disclose {{that the combination of}} 320 K and 26 MPa gives an optimum production of turmeric oil containing 71 wt% purity of three turmerones. Subsequently, a normal phase silica gel 60 column is employed to separate and purify three major turmerones from the turmeric oil extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide. The 86 wt% purity of Ar-turmerone and 81 wt% purity of alpha+beta-turmerone have been separated, collected, and identified by <b>liquid-solid</b> <b>chromatography,</b> NMR qualification, and HPLC quantification, respectively.

Sc in Environmental Hygiene, Kerman University of Medical Sciences Abstract Background: The {{prevalence}} rate of opioids consumption {{is high in}} Iran. The latest research approach related to substance abuse considers the role of plasma proteins in novel treatments of addiction. Since long-term consumption of opioids has some effects on liver function and plasma transfer systems, {{the present study was}} designed to determine the electrophoretic profile of plasma proteins in opiates-addict subjects. Materials and methods: In this cross-control study, the sample groups consisted of 42 opium consumers and 35 heroine dependents as case group and 35 non-addict volunteers as control group. The control group was matched with addicts for age and sex. Opioid consumption was confirmed by laboratory diagnostic tests on urine samples such as immunochromatography (RSA), rapidosis and complementary tests including <b>liquid-solid</b> column <b>chromatography</b> and thin layer chromatography (TLC). After blood collection and serum preparation, serum electrophoresis was performed. Data were presented as mean±SEM and analyzed by SPSS ver. 11. 5. The comparison of groups was done by using parametric tests and p< 0. 01 was considered as statistically significant. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the amounts of albumin, alpha- 1 -globulin, alpha- 2 -globulin and beta-globulin between groups. Gamma-globulin concentration was not significantly different between opium addicts (17. 38 ± 3. 61 gr/L) and heroin addicts (17. 48 ± 4. 4 gr/L), but it was significantly high (p< 0. 01) in both heroin and opium groups compared to the control group (13. 3 ± 1. 8 gr/L). Conclusion: Morphine bonding to serum albumin and other impurities in narcotic drugs may lead to the production of antigen complexes, stimulation of immune system and consequently increase in gammaglobulins concentration. Also, opioids binding to opiate receptors, directly or indirectly, can affect immune system through stimulating hypophysis-hypothalamus pathway. Although continuous consumption of opioids affects both cellular immune and hormonal systems, significant increase of gammaglobulin band can be related to the high risk behaviors associated with opioids consumption and the higher probability of infectious diseases in addicts due to poor health status...|$|R
