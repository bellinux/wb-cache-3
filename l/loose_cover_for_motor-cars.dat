40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{evaluation}} of modelled sea-ice coverage against reality is affected by uncertainties in the retrieval of sea-ice coverage from satellite, by the usage of sea-ice extent to overcome these uncertainties, and by internal variability. We find that for Arctic summer sea ice, model biases in sea-ice extent can be qualitatively different from biases in sea-ice area. This is because {{about half of the}} CMIP 5 models and satellite retrievals based on the Bootstrap and the ASI algorithm show a compact ice cover in summer with large areas of high-concentration sea ice, while {{the other half of the}} CMIP 5 models and satellite retrievals based on the NASA Team algorithm show a <b>loose</b> ice <b>cover.</b> <b>For</b> the Arctic winter sea-ice cover, differences in grid geometry can cause synthetic biases in sea-ice extent that are larger than the observational uncertainty. Comparing the uncertainty arising directly from the satellite retrievals with those that arise from internal variability, we find that the latter by far dominates the uncertainty estimate for trends in sea-ice extent and area: most of the differences between modelled and observed trends can simply be explained by internal variability. For absolute sea-ice area and sea-ice extent, however, internal variability cannot explain the difference between model and observations for about half the CMIP 5 models that we analyse here. All models that we examined have regional biases, as expressed by the root-mean-square error in concentration, that are larger than the differences between individual satellite algorithms...|$|R

50|$|By 1920 Hadfields Limited's own {{freehold}} land had expanded to around 220 acre {{in and around}} Sheffield.

60|$|Not quite, {{but almost}} quite. Take motorcars, for example.

60|$|Then {{the sounds}} of man's {{activity}} suddenly commenced, for there was a clatter forward where the Spaniards flung the <b>loose</b> <b>covers</b> from the hatch, and a harsh rattle of chain mingled with the soft patter of their naked feet. In another few moments a sharp, musical clinking broke out, and Austin saw Tom, who {{had served as a}} steamer's donkey-man, straighten his bent back when a rush of white vapour whirled with a strident hissing about the locomotive boiler, which now drove the winch. He grinned at Austin, and glanced at the misty creek, far down which a faint screaming was dying away.|$|R
5000|$|Further patrons can be {{identified}} by their records of payments to Goodison, though they cannot be connected with surviving pieces; the Duke of Newcastle's payment in 1740 is entered in an account book conserved at the British Library.

40|$|Oats {{have been}} among the five or six leading crops in acreage grown in Utah since its settlement. For many years Swedish Select has been by far the most {{predominant}} variety. This variety is well adapted to Utah conditions, but because of its high susceptibility to <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smut, it is not the most desirable. In 1934, after extensive trials, the variety, Markton, which is resistant to <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smuts, was introduced into the state to replace Swedish Select. In those trials, Markton averaged 13 percent higher in acre yield than Swedish Select. Markton possessed one drawback in that it had a yellowish kernel, whereas Swedish Select produced a large white kernel. As a result of this, Markton has never been grown extensively in the state. Uton, which is a selection from the Markton x Swedish Select cross, is a high-yielding variety resistant to both <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smuts, and yet produces a large white kernel similar to that of Swedish Select. The good qualities of both Swedish Select and Markton appear to have been combined in Uton...|$|R

60|$|True to form, Tarzan at once {{dropped to}} {{his hands and knees}} and searched beneath the bed for the lost gold piece. Strange as it might appear, he had never before looked beneath the bed. He found the gold piece, and {{something}} else he found, too--a small wooden box with a <b>loose</b> <b>cover.</b> Bringing them both out he returned the sovereign to its bag and the bag to its shelf within the cupboard; then he investigated the box. It contained a quantity of cylindrical bits of metal, cone-shaped at one end and flat at the other, with a projecting rim. They were all quite green and dull, coated with years of verdigris.|$|R
50|$|The Romans {{also used}} a daybed for {{reclining}} {{in the daytime}} and to sleep on at night. Developed from the Greek prototype, the Roman daybed was designed with legs carved in wood or cast bronze. The Romans also adapted a chaise longue style chair for the accubatio (the act of reclining during a meal). At Roman banquets, the usual number of persons occupying each bed was three, with three daybeds forming three sides of a small square, so that the triclinium (the dining-room of a Roman residence) allowed for a party of nine. The Romans did not practice upholstery, so the couches were made comfortable with pillows, <b>loose</b> <b>covers</b> and animal skins.|$|R
5000|$|Canon Valpy {{has been}} {{credited}} with having injected “new life and a lightness of touch” in English style, as documented in interiors he painted in water-colours now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. “This inspired churchman,” comments Carolyn McDowell, “put together a collection of 18c furniture, decorated his plain walls with clusters of low hung watercolors and prints, used a pretty chintz <b>loose</b> <b>cover</b> on the chairs, replaced indiscriminate clutter with a few well chosen ornaments and placed piles of books lying around for reading, rather than for show.” Over the mantel in his Drawing Room is a pre-raphaelite portrait by Rossetti, revealing that he was “a very astute purchaser.” ...|$|R
