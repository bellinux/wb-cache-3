5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George {{to announce}} his candidacy for governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most political observers because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. He promised to run the state government <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

Issues included failure to insure vehicles, operating <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> without a business license, metered fares unknown to passengers, metered fares not inspected by the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, and failure to report income and pay taxes. Many drivers had their licenses suspended for violations.

25|$|Following {{a failed}} 107-day cigar-makers' strike in 1877, Gompers {{assisted}} President Adolph Strasser in radically restructuring the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) in 1879. Henceforth, the union would be run <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> The international union {{would have the}} authority to take control of local affiliates. Dues would be raised to build financial reserves, and to pay sick and death benefits. A union bank would be established to provide short-term loans for workers who had been laid off and were seeking new jobs. The constitution of the union would be changed to permit the international to seize funds from locals with flush treasuries and transfer the money to locals in distress.|$|E

25|$|The Toronto Port Authority (TPA) {{came into}} being on June 8, 1999 and the THC was dissolved. Unlike the {{previous}} Harbour Commission, the Port Authority used a different management structure and a different management focus. Its new board of directors contained only one City of Toronto-appointed member. The Authority was also expected to manage the port more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> The new authority entered into negotiations with the City of Toronto. It wanted $20 million from the City, the return of lands transferred to the City in 1994, and to be exempt from municipal property taxes, while the City wanted out from its $2.8 million annual subsidy. This would {{be the start of}} a protracted dispute that would last several years.|$|E
25|$|Nance {{emphasizes}} the splintered nature of al-Qaeda, {{and points out}} that it is in fact operating as a collective of smaller groups inspired by Osama bin Laden. The author warns {{of the power of the}} Internet as used by terrorists for recruitment and communication. He observes that where al-Qaeda had previously functioned as a set of terrorism criminal entities, it shaped its operations to become more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> Nance cites key business elements to al-Qaeda and ways it serves as a central organizing hub for splinter groups globally, that include: use of videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden, beheading videos, and martyrdom videos, serving as a central repository of information, giving armament materials to followers, motivating each other, and providing economic funding for terrorist operations.|$|E
25|$|Air Marshal Les Fisher, {{who headed}} the RAAF from 1994 to 1998, served as the last CAS and the first Chief of Air Force (CAF), the change of name {{occurring}} in 1997. Fisher instituted a policy requiring staff to meet minimum physical fitness standards {{to remain in the}} service, {{for the first time in}} Air Force history. Air Marshal Errol McCormack commanded the RAAF as it moved into the 21st century, addressing fundamental cultural questions such as the balance of change and tradition, and whether defence should be run <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> Beginning in 2000, he reintroduced the distinctive dark blue uniform that had been chosen by Richard Williams in the 1920s but discarded in 1972 by then-CAS, Air Marshal Hannah, in favour of a more neutral blue suit. McCormack’s successor, Air Marshal Angus Houston, became well-known to the public for contradicting the Federal Government’s version of events in relation to the Children Overboard Affair. In 2005, Houston was promoted to Chief of the Defence Force, the third Air Force member out of 18 Chiefs of the Defence Force or equivalent, and the third to achieve the rank of air chief marshal.|$|E

500|$|Among proponents and {{publishers}} of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run {{and what their}} goals should be, reflecting a [...] "clash between two philosophies for advocating social change". [...] On {{one side of the}} debate are papers that seek to function <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> and generate a profit and a wide readership in order to benefit the homeless in a practical way; on the other are papers that seek to provide a [...] "voice" [...] to the homeless and poor without watering down their message for a broad readership. [...] Timothy Harris, the director of Real Change, has described the two camps as [...] "liberal entrepreneurial" [...] and [...] "radical, grassroots activist".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at two locations in Sapporo, Studio Jack at the Yamaha Center in Chūō-ku, and at Chieria Studio in the Sapporo Lifelong Learning Center in Nishi-ku. After it was commissioned, the album {{took only a}} month to produce, as Sakanaction mostly reworked demos they had already produced to create an album. Only the song [...] "Yoru no Higashigawa" [...] was written specifically for the album. Two of the songs had been released by Yamaguchi's first band Dutchman, [...] "Inner World" [...] in 2002 and [...] "Mikazuki Sunset" [...] in 2003. As a soloist, Yamaguchi released a remix of the song [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] on the compilation album Music for Pardisco in 2004. Retrospectively, Yamaguchi said that Go to the Future felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> card for Sakanaction, due to the album being a compilation of already created songs.|$|E
500|$|Palmer, by letter, hired Peddle to do {{the design}} work in late March. [...] She {{instructed}} the artist that the coin {{was to have a}} figure of Isabella on the obverse, and the inscription [...] "Commemorative coin issued for the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition by Act of Congress, 1492–1892" [...] on the reverse, as well as the denomination {{and the name of the}} country. [...] The chairwoman did not request that Peddle provide the Lady Managers with the design before sending it to the Mint. [...] Palmer informed Carlisle and Leech of her instructions. Carlisle had no objection to a coin being designed by a woman, or to the use of Isabella's head. [...] The secretary told Palmer that the reverse, with its long inscription, would appear <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> advertising token, and he asked that it be revised. [...] Leech sent a note to Superintendent Bosbyshell informing him that the Lady Managers would likely have an outside sculptor create the obverse and asking him to have Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber create some designs for the reverse for possible use.|$|E

500|$|Canadian music {{magazine}} Exclaim! published two {{reviews of}} Daybreaker. Bradley Zorgdrager gave an unfavourable {{review of the}} album's sound. He said although the tracks are [...] "catchy and occasionally compelling, they're essentially identical and formulaic, as the atmospheric build-ups and soaring riffs make way for boring breakdowns. The metal-influenced parts sound forced to appease fans disappointed with their last release, which results in Daybreaker sounding more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> move than a work of art." [...] Scott Harms' review was more favourable, praising the band's return to a much more aggressive style. He credits it for incorporating influences from previous albums, saying [...] "they have found a balance in which {{to return to the}} Searle brothers' heavy sounds while carefully incorporating Sam Carter's soaring clean vocals". Harms summarised his review by saying, [...] "as a whole, [...] sounds epic". Adam Rees of Metal Hammer rated the album 7 out of 10, acknowledging the [...] "abundant" [...] inclusion of string instruments and piano and the way these instruments create atmosphere. Ress ended his review by calling Daybreaker, [...] "A brave and brilliant British metal album". Canoe.ca author Darryl Sterdan awarded the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying it [...] "balanc their newfound sensitivity and maturity with plenty of good old-fashioned techno-metal frenzy and primal-scream aggro. Pity they didn’t write memorable songs while they were at it." ...|$|E

The prenuptial agreement had 19 provisions which described the couple's wedded lifestyle and included {{a definition of}} [...] "nagging". Ball wanted children, but his wife was unable to get pregnant due to reproductive problems several years before their wedding. Ruth Ball filed for divorce in 1943, but Edward Ball sought an annulment, unsuccessfully appealing {{it all the way}} to the Florida Supreme Court. He finally agreed to pay his ex-wife $250,000 alimony in 1949.|$|E

2500|$|He ran his illegal {{operation}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> {{and before long}} {{he became one of}} the largest employers in Puget Sound. Known on the West Coast as [...] "the Good Bootlegger", Olmstead did not engage in the practice of diluting his contraband with toxic industrial grade chemicals in order to increase his profits, selling only bonded liquor imported from Canada. To most other bootleggers, smuggling alcohol was but one facet of their criminal organization, and many were involved in prostitution, gambling, gun-running, and narcotics trafficking. Olmstead did not engage in these activities, and many did not regard him as a [...] "true criminal" [...] as a result. Despite the risks involved in rum-running, Olmstead did not allow his employees to carry firearms, telling his men he would rather lose a shipment of liquor than a life.|$|E
