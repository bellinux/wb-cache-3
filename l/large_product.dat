2500|$|Maybe {{the most}} {{important}} injective module is the abelian group Q/Z. It is an injective cogenerator {{in the category of}} abelian groups, which means that it is injective and any other module is contained in a suitably <b>large</b> <b>product</b> of copies of Q/Z. So in particular, every abelian group is a subgroup of an injective one. It is quite significant that this is also true over any ring: every module is a submodule of an injective one, or [...] "the category of left R-modules has enough injectives." [...] To prove this, one uses the peculiar properties of the abelian group Q/Z to construct an injective cogenerator in the category of left R-modules.|$|E
