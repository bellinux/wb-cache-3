5|$|The longest living eastern {{green mamba}} was a captive {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens to <b>live</b> <b>that</b> long, they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|M. l. assimilis, {{commonly}} known as purple-backed fairywren, occurs across central Australia, from Queensland and western New South Wales to coastal Western Australia. It was initially described in 1901 by Australian ornithologist Alfred John North and called the purple-backed superb warbler. Breeding males of this {{and the other two}} northern subspecies differ from subspecies lamberti in having a darker violet blue crown and a purple back. Females are identical, however. There is a broad area where intermediate forms between this and subspecies lamberti <b>live</b> <b>that</b> is bordered by Goondiwindi, Wide Bay, Rockhampton and Emerald in southern Queensland.|$|E
5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should <b>live,</b> <b>that</b> she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E

It was later revealed that Smart was kidnapped by Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee, two individuals with whom Ricci had no connection.|$|E

Tories eyed antique armour and dreamed of courtly love, and Queen Victoria twice noted in her diary that she had discussed the tournament with Lord Melbourne and although her view was that the event would be a foolish amusement, the choice of the Duchess of Somerset as Queen of Beauty was to her liking. With only two months to <b>live</b> <b>that</b> tragic figure, Lady Flora Hastings, wrote in 1839 to her mother {{on the subject of the}} upcoming Eglinton Tournament, expressing her concern that one of the knights might be killed in the violent sport.|$|E
