50|$|In 1961, NASA astronaut, Wally Schirra {{contacted}} Courtney Graham, {{a fellow}} pilot, to discuss creating a {{design for a}} small, <b>lightweight</b> <b>headset</b> {{to be used in}} the Mercury spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|Responsibility for {{the supply}} of Bowman audio ancillaries, {{including}} the stereo staff-user headset, noise-cancelling general-purpose handset, and loudspeaker unit, was vested in Selex ES, which also provided the <b>lightweight</b> <b>headset,</b> respirator adapter, and remote pressel switch associated with the PRR.|$|E
40|$|This project aims {{to improve}} {{performance}} of NASA missions by developing multimodal neuroelectric technologies for augmented human-system interaction. Neuroelectric technologies will add completely new modes of interaction that operate in parallel with keyboards, speech, or other manual controls, thereby increasing the bandwidth of human-system interaction. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of real-time electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for a direct neuroelectric human-computer interface. We recorded EMG signals from an elastic sleeve with dry electrodes, while a human subject performed a range of discrete gestures. A machine-teaming algorithm was trained to recognize the EMG patterns associated with the gestures and map them to control signals. Successful applications now include piloting two Class 4 aircraft simulations (F- 15 and 757) and entering data with a "virtual" numeric keyboard. Current research focuses on on-line adaptation of EMG sensing and processing and recognition of continuous gestures. We are also extending this on-line pattern recognition methodology to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This {{will allow us to}} bypass muscle activity and draw control signals directly from the human brain. Our system can reliably detect P-rhythm (a periodic EEG signal from motor cortex in the 10 Hz range) with a <b>lightweight</b> <b>headset</b> containing saline-soaked sponge electrodes. The data show that EEG p-rhythm can be modulated by real and imaginary motions. Current research focuses on using biofeedback to train of human subjects to modulate EEG rhythms on demand, and to examine interactions of EEG-based control with EMG-based and manual control. Viewgraphs on these neuroelectric technologies are also included...|$|E
50|$|In Finland call centres employ an {{estimated}} 100,000 people, but most work with customer relations in larger companies. 10,000 {{people are working}} for companies involved with telemarketing.Telemarketing often is the first job young people get. But {{it is also a}} way out or back to the labour market for handicapped, immigrants and pensioners.In Finland the profession has had a bad reputation because of work-related injuries. The strain on neck, shoulders, eyes and ears can be considerable.Health problems have however been reduced considerably thanks to <b>lightweight</b> <b>headsets,</b> ergonomic working stations and more tasks, like documentation, done automatically by computers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, airline {{headsets}} were {{so large and}} cumbersome that many pilots had switched back {{to the use of}} handheld microphones for communications. The speed and complexity of jet airliners caused a need for the introduction of small, <b>lightweight</b> <b>headsets</b> into the cockpit. In 1961, United Airlines solicited new designs from anyone who was interested. Courtney Graham, a United Airlines pilot, was one of the many who thought the heavy headsets should be replaced by something lighter. He collaborated with his pilot friend Keith Larkin to create a small, functional design which was robust enough to pass airlines standards. (Larkin had been working for a small company called Plane-Aids, a Japanese import company which offered spectacles and sunglasses that contained transistor radios in their temple pieces.) The final design, incorporating two small hearing aid-style transducers attached to a headband was submitted to United Airline approval. UAL's approval of the innovative design caused Graham and Larkin to incorporate as Pacific Plantronics (now called Plantronics, Inc.) on May 18, 1961. They introduced the first <b>lightweight</b> communications <b>headset,</b> the MS-50, to the commercial marketplace in 1962.|$|R
