50|$|Due to the {{mechanism}} of the puppets, all puppets' <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> {{are designed to be}} their most expressive part. Hence, all puppets wield their weapons with their <b>left</b> <b>hands,</b> making them appear left-handed. Since puppeteers are mostly right-handed, the puppets are designed to fully occupy their right hands by supporting the puppets' full body weight, each of which weighs an average of 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), and control most of the puppets' internal mechanisms: including head tilts, eye blinks, mouth movements, and the puppets' right arms; while the puppeteers' <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> control the <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> of the puppets and their puppets' foot movements.|$|R

5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch, Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball had gone out of play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about an}} excitation of TE wave mode in the <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> waveguides, {{one of which}} is the air gap waveguide sandwiched by semi-infinite negative permeability and permittivity media, other is a grounded <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> slab waveguide. Dispersion curves of their waveguides were derived, and backward characteristic of volume and surface wave modes were found An excitation characteristic of TE mode using microstrip line transducer was analyzed using method of Fourier and Hilbert transforms of electromagnetic fields. Thus propagation of TE mode in the <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> waveguides was confirmed theoretically around 1 GHz. Experiments were carried out using <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> guide which was made by composed structure of sprit ring resonator and fine wire circuit boards in 147 ^* 110 ^* 10 mm^ 3 Frequency response of <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> mode was measured by Network analyzer...|$|R

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the right one is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
