40|$|This essay aims {{to explain}} the {{attraction}} toward the main character Stavrogin that the other characters experience in Dostoevsky's The Possessed, his great novel from 1871. I will mainly employ the terms “orientation” and “disorientation” in my analysis of Stavrogin's power of attraction. The theory used for this reading is principally inspired by Sara Ahmed's Queer Phenomenology – Orientation, Objects, Others (2006), and the meaning I attach to the terms “orientation” and “disorientation” is derived from Ahmed's use of them. Ahmed's queer phenomenology helps us to reflect upon how Stavrogin functions {{as a point of}} orientation in the novel. This makes him a demonic influence on the other characters, {{in the sense that he}} disorientates them. The Possessed asks us what happens when we “lose our way”, and confusion as well as disorientation is a general theme of the novel. This topic has been raised before, but few have connected the demonic disorientation with the underlying unconventional desires, such as Peter Verchovensky's desire for Stavrogin. In this essay I attempt to show how Stavrogin can be thought of as a “new” orientation for the other characters, and how their following him causes them to follow <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> <b>lead</b> to destruction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableResearch of bacteria-driven {{degeneration}} of tumor cells, initially {{pioneered by}} Dr William Coley in 1893 using heat-killed mixtures of streptococci, {{has led to}} the scrutiny of the enterobacteria species Salmonella typhimurium on various cancer lines since the mid- 1990 s. Salmonella is facultative anaerobe that typically causes enteritis in humans, but attenuated strains have been observed to specifically target cancer tissue when injected into the circulatory system of mammalian hosts. The LT 2 (Lilleengan Type 2) Salmonella was isolated by Lilleengan in 1953 and was found to favor cancer cells and promote anti-tumor activity in 2005 (unpublished data). LT 2 was the first Salmonella typhimurium to be sequenced, facilitating the creation of genomic microarrays that are currently being used to determine which genes are essential for tumor-killing mechanisms. Experimental Approaches: Therapeutic Salmonella has been developed and stored at the Cancer Research Center (CRC), which consists of approximately two thousand auxotrophic Salmonella typhimurium mutants stored in sealed stab vials for over 50 years at room temperature. Although therapeutic Salmonella {{has been shown to be}} effective against prostate cancer cell lines, little is known about the therapeutic breadth of Salmonella cancer therapy. Using tissue cultures, therapeutic Salmonella candidate CRC 2631 will be tested on various human cancer cell lines. My studies will focus on colon cancer cell line HT 29. Predicted Outcomes: Salmonella attachment and invasion of the HT 29 cells is expected, which will be characterized by fluorescent microscopy time course experiment and gentamycin exclusion assays. Data from Salmonella attachment and invasion of prostate cancer lines will be used for comparison. Overall significance: The examination of salmonella-treated tumors will test the therapeutic range of CRC 2631 Salmonella therapy, thus revealing what types of cancers can be effectively treated using therapeutic Salmonella. The nature (biological and chemical) of therapeutic Salmonella selection of the cancer cells can be determined through analysis of the mechanism of bacterial attachment or lack thereof, in addition to identification of molecules present or not present in the tested cancer cell <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> <b>lead</b> to the discrimination and destruction of cancer cells but not normal tissue.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) and {{a point of}} {{electricity}} generation is a promising option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. One issue with respect to CCS is the design of carbon dioxide transport, storage and injection system. This dissertation develops a model, OptimaCCS, that combines economic and spatial optimization for the integration of CCS transport, storage and injection infrastructure to minimize costs. The model solves for the lowest-cost set of pipeline routes and storage/injection sites that connect CO 2 sources to the storage. It factors in pipeline costs, site-specific storage costs, and pipeline routes considerations involving existing right of ways and land use. It also considers cost reductions resulting from networking the pipelines segment from the plants into trunk <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> <b>lead</b> to the storage sites. OptimaCCS is demonstrated for a system involving carbon capture at 14 Texas coal-fired power plants and three potential deep-saline aquifer sequestration sites. In turn OptimaCCS generates 1) a cost-effective CCS pipeline network for transporting CO 2 from all the power plants to the possible storage sites, and 2) {{an estimate of the}} costs associated with the CO 2 transport and storage. It is used to examine variations in the configuration of the pipeline network depending on differences in storage site-specific injection costs. These results highlight how various levels of cooperation by CO 2 emitters and difference in injection costs among possible storage sites can affect the most cost-effective arrangement for deploying CCS infrastructure. This study also analyzes CCS deployment under the features in a piece of legislation the draft of American Power Act (APA) - that was proposed in 2010 which contained a goal of CCS capacity for emissions from 72 Gigawatt (GW) by 2034. A model was developed that simulates CCS deployment while considering different combinations of carbon price trajectories, technology progress, and assumed auction prices. The model shows that the deployment rate of CCS technology under APA is affected by the available bonus allowances, carbon price trajectory, CCS incentive, technological adaptation, and auction process. Furthermore it demonstrates that the 72 GW objective can only be achieved in a rapid deployment scenario with quick learning-by-doing and high carbon price starting at 25 dollars in 2013 with a 5 percent annual increase. Furthermore under the slow and moderate deployment scenarios CCS capacity falls short of achieving the 72 GW objective...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{cancer is}} {{understood}} as an epigenetic {{as well as a}} genetic disease. The main epigenetic hallmarks of the cancer cell are DNA methylation and histone modifications. The latter changes may be an optimal target for novel anticancer agents. The main goal of using histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) would be restoration of gene expression of those tumor-suppressor genes that have been transcriptionally silenced by promoter-associated histone deacetylation. However, HDACIs have pleiotropic effects that we are only just starting to understand. These may also be responsible for the induction of differentiation, cell-cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic effects. There are now so many HDACIs available, with such different chemical structures and biological and biochemical properties, that it is hopeful {{that at least some of}} them will succeed, probably in combination with other agents or therapies. In our studies we focussed ourselves on studies some new HDACIs, that can be useful for treating cancers, including leukemia and epithelial cancer. To do that, we used novel HDACIs, like BML- 210, and their combination with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Cell differentiation and proliferation in general, and specific gene expression require de novo protein synthesis and/or post-translational protein modifications. So, we tried to identify proteins in general and specifically the proteins that could be important for the cell differentiation process, and when and where in the cell the proteins appear. We delineated that HDACIs inhibited leukemia (NB 4 and HL- 60) cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent way. Moreover, BML- 210 blocked HeLa cell growth and promoted apoptosis in a time-dependent way. Combining of BML- 210 with ATRA induced a differentiation process in leukemia cell <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> <b>lead</b> to apoptosis. This correlated with cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 stage and changes in expression of cell cycle proteins (p 21, p 53), transcription factors (NF-κB, Sp 1) and their binding activity to consensus or specific promoter sequences. We also assessed histone modifications, i. e. H 3 phosphorylation and H 4 hyperacetylation due to HDACI, leading to chromatin remodeling and changes in gene transcriptions. We have also studied changes in protein maps caused by HDACIs and differentiation agents, identifying differences for a few proteins due to growth inhibition and induction of differentiation in NB 4 cells using BML- 210 alone or in combination with ATRA. These proteins are involved in cell proliferation and signal transduction, like Rab, actin and calpain. One of them was alpha-dystrobrevin (α-DB). To further study possible roles of the latter, we determined changes of α-DB protein isoform expression that correlated with induction of differentiation. We thus identified a novel ensemble of α-DB interacting proteins in promyelocytic leukemia cells, including tropomyosin 3, actin, tubulin, RIBA, STAT and others, being important in cytoskeleton reorganization and signal transduction. Using confocal microscopy, we determined that α-DB co-localizes with HSP 90 and F-actin in NB 4 and HeLa cells. We also revealed that it changes sub-cellular compartment after treatment with ATRA and/or BML- 210. α-DB silencing affected F-actin expression in HeLa cells, further supporting the idea that α-DB is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization in cells. Altogether, our results suggest that α−DB may work as a structural protein during proliferation and differentiation processes of human cancer cells. Based on our findings, we suggest that HDACIs, like BML- 210, can be promising anticancer agents, especially in leukemia treatment, by inducing apoptosis and regulating proliferation and differentiation through the modulation of histone acetylations and gene expression...|$|E
