40|$|Cofilin {{is a low}} {{molecular}} weight actin-modulating protein whose structure and function are conserved among eucaryotes. Cofilin exhibits in vitro both a monomeric actin-sequestering activity and a filamentous actin-severing activity. To investigate in vivo functions of cofilin, cofilin was overexpressed in Dictyostelium discoideum cells. An increase {{in the content of}} D. discoideum cofilin (d-cofilin) by sevenfold induced a co-overproduction of actin by threefold. In cells over-expressing d-cofilin, the amount of filamentous actin but not that of monomeric actin was increased. Overexpressed d-cofilin co-sedimented with actin filaments, suggesting that the sequestering activity of d- cofilin is weak in vivo. The overexpression of d-cofilin increased actin bundles just beneath ruffling membranes where d-cofilin was co- localized. The overexpression of d-cofilin also stimulated cell movement as well as membrane ruffling. We have demonstrated in vitro that d-cofilin transformed <b>latticework</b> <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> cross-linked by alpha-actinin into bundles probably by severing the filaments. D. discoideum cofilin may sever actin filaments in vivo and induce bundling <b>of</b> the <b>filaments</b> in the presence of cross-linking proteins so as to generate contractile systems involved in membrane ruffling and cell movement...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a functional {{role for the}} paraflagellar rod (PFR) in motility of Leishmania mexicana. The PFR is a complex cytoskeletal structure running parallel to the axoneme in the flagella of kinetoplastid protozoa. The PFR is composed <b>of</b> a <b>latticework</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>filaments</b> whose major constituents are two related proteins (PFR- 1 and PFR- 2 in Leishmania). The molecular details of their assembly into PFR filaments are unknown as is the biological function of the PFR. As an approach to understanding the structure and function of the PFR in Leishmania, we made L. mexicana null mutants of PFR- 2. PFR- 2 minus parasites grow and divide normally in culture and still express the PFR- 1 protein. They lack most of the PFR structure demonstrating that the PFR- 2 protein is an essential constituent of the PFR. Detailed ultrastructural analysis of the PFR- 2 null mutant reveals {{the presence of a}} residual inner substructure of the PFR which contains PFR- 1 protein, indicating that PFR- 1 can polymerize in the absence of PFR- 2. The PFR- 2 null mutant displays pronounced changes in flagellar beat waveform and forward swimming velocity, compared to wild type parasites consistent with decreased internal elastic bending resistance in PFR-lacking flagella, and indicating a functional role for the PFR in the motility of Leishmania...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Light {{and high}} voltage {{electron}} microscopy (HVEM) procedures have been employed {{to examine the}} processes regulating saltatory motion in neurons. Light microscope studies demonstrate that organelle transport occurs by rapid bidirectional saltations along linear pathways in cultured neuroblastoma cells. HVEM stereo images of axons reveal that microtubules (Mts) and organelles are suspended in a continuous <b>latticework</b> <b>of</b> fine microtrabecular <b>filaments</b> and that the Mts and lattice constitute a basic cytoskeletal structure mediating the motion of particles along axons. We propose that particle transport depends on dynamic properties of nonstatic microtrabecular lattice components. Experiments were initiated {{to determine the effects}} of changes in divalent cation concentrations (Ca 2 + and Mg t+) on: (a) the continuation of transport and (b) the corresponding structural properties of the microtrabecular lattice.

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in molecular clouds {{has attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} as {{there seems to be a}} relation between the evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and star formation. The study of the fragmentation process has been motivated by simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have analysed the evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> using numerical simulations where the filaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the early evolution <b>of</b> pc-scale <b>filaments</b> that form within individual clouds. We focus on three questions: How do the line masses <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> evolve? How and when do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line masses <b>of</b> the <b>filaments?</b> We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the properties <b>of</b> the identified <b>filaments</b> with the predictions <b>of</b> analytic <b>filament</b> stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the identified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The first fragments appear early when the line masses lie well below the critical line mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium solution. The average line masses <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> identified in 3 D density cubes increases far more quickly than those identified in 2 D column density maps. Our results suggest that hydrostatic or dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant impact on the early dynamical evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good approach for fragmentation analysis. Caution must be exercised in interpreting distributions <b>of</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> identified in column density maps, especially in the case <b>of</b> low-mass <b>filaments.</b> Comparing or combining results from studies that use different filament finding techniques is strongly discouraged.

40|$|We measured, by {{fluorescence}} correlation spectroscopy, {{the motion}} <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> in solution during hydrolysis of ATP by acto-heavy meromyosin (acto-HMM). The method {{relies on the}} fact that the intensity of fluorescence fluctuates as fluorescently labeled actin filaments enter and leave a small sample volume. The rapidity of these number fluctuations is characterized by the autocorrelation function, which decays to 0 in time that is related to the average velocity <b>of</b> translation <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> The time <b>of</b> decay of the autocorrelation function <b>of</b> bare actin <b>filaments</b> in solution was 10. 59 +/- 0. 85 s. Strongly bound (rigor) heads slowed down the diffusion. Direct observation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that addition of HMM did not change the average length or flexibility <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments,</b> suggesting that the decrease in diffusion was not due to a HMM-induced change in the shape <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> Rather, slowing down of translational motion was caused by an increase in the volume of the diffusing complex. Surprisingly, the addition of ATP to acto-HMM accelerated the motion <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments.</b> The acceleration was the greatest at the low molar ratios of HMM:actin. Direct observation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that in the presence of ATP the average length <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> did not change and that the filaments became stiffer, suggesting that acceleration of diffusion was not due to an ATP-induced increase in flexibility <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> These results show that some of the energy of splitting of ATP is impaired to actin filaments and suggest that 0. 06 +/- 0. 02 of HMM interferes with the diffusion <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> during hydrolysis <b>of</b> ATP...|$|R
