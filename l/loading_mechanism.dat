25|$|In 1929 {{design work}} {{began in the}} Soviet Union for a new 130mm 45 caliber {{submarine}} deck gun that {{would have the same}} external ballistics as the older 130 mm/55 B7 Pattern 1913 gun. It was intended for the gun to use a wedge lock and fixed ammunition, but the plans were changed already before the prototype was ordered. Blueprints and a prototype was ordered from Bolshevik Plant no. 232 in 1930. The design bureau director was N.N.Magdasijev and project leader G.N.Rafalovits. Others involved in the design were S.A.Morozov, S.A.Zalazaev, B.A.Lever, V.M.Rosenberg and V.I.Kudrjashov. The gun design was changed from submarine to destroyer weapon using separate instead of fixed ammunition and in 1932 new specifications included a change from 45 to 50 calibers and a screw breech block instead of wedge block. During test firing in 1934—35 several shortcomings were found in the gun design, particularly with the breech and <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Because the Leningrad class destroyers that were supposed to use the guns were already under construction the 130mm B-13 gun was accepted for mass production in 1935 and the first twelve guns were finished during the same year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{failure mode}} of the {{corroded}} RC beam may shift from designed failure mode to others failure mode, as the <b>load</b> resisting <b>mechanism</b> changes {{due to the}} corrosion ratio of rebars. In this study, the <b>load</b> resisting <b>mechanism</b> and the failure mode of the corroded RC beam were investigated based on the bond performance. If the corroded RC beam is non-uniformly corroded, the beam suffers beam action and fails in flexural failure. Otherwise, the <b>load</b> resisting <b>mechanism</b> and the failure mode depend on the corrosion ratio of bottom portion stirrups. Moreover, the decision point is proposed to predict the <b>load</b> resisting <b>mechanisms</b> in the corroded RC beam...|$|R

500|$|Most {{notably the}} 68-pounder was fitted to the s [...] and [...] [...] Originally it was {{intended}} to fit forty 68-pounders, primarily on one gun deck, but this specification changed during their building and they were finally equipped with twenty-six 68-pounders (13 on each side). Alongside these, the ships were equipped with new rifled breech loading Armstrong guns of two types; 7 inch and 40 pounders. [...] Although the Armstrong guns represented a new direction in artillery, the breech <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> meant that they were unable to withstand the explosion of a heavy cartridge. Smaller cartridge charges were therefore required and the gun's muzzle velocity suffered as a result. Ironically the Armstrong Guns were therefore incapable of penetrating the armour fitted to the Warrior-class ships, while the 68-pounder (with its high muzzle velocity) could. [...] As late as 1867 it was planned to fit the new s with 68-pounders, but they were instead completed with a RML 7 inch gun and a RML 64 pounder 64 cwt gun.|$|E
2500|$|Type-72Z - At the International Arms Exhibition, {{which took}} place in Baghdad between 28 April - 2 May 1989, a T-55 {{equipped}} with the 2A46 125mm gun with fume extractor one third of the way down the barrel from the T-72 tank was displayed. This modernized vehicle was designated as T-72Z, which at first mislead foreign experts since it was believed that the project was based on the T-72 tank. In fact, the number [...] "72" [...] originated from the year of modernization - 1372 according to the Muslim calendar. The <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> of this vehicle was also taken from T-72. The fitting of the <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> required increasing the aft section of the turret. A stub case ejection port on rear of turret. The tank's armour protection was also reinforced through the use of add-on armour on the tank's front glacis. The vehicle also mounted the EFCS-3 fire control system developed by the Slovenian firm 'Fotona' and a new transmission. A set of explosive reactive armour is an optional extra. It is believed that around 200 T-54/T-55 tanks and 150 Chinese Type-59 tanks were brought up to the T-72Z standard.|$|E

The Sharps made a superior sniper weapon of greater accuracy than the more commonly issued muzzle-loading rifled muskets. This was due mainly to the higher rate of fire of the breech <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> and superior quality of manufacture, as well as the ease of which it could be reloaded from a kneeling or prone position.|$|E

30|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} {{stability is}} strongly {{dependent on the}} vertical loading system along with the support condition. The vertical load applied to a beam should retain its vertical direction throughout the course of loading even when lateral and torsional behavior is observed. In addition, the <b>loading</b> transfer <b>mechanism</b> should not have any resistance on the lateral deformation and torsional rotation at the application point of the load. Previous studies using lateral and torsional buckling experiments focused on full-scale size beams. The <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in previous studies were either distributed or point loads. König and Pauli (1990) utilized steel and water weights as the distributed <b>load</b> <b>mechanism</b> to perform the lateral and torsional buckling experiment in reinforced and prestressed concrete beams. The distributed <b>load</b> <b>mechanism</b> has limitations on space, logistics, and safety, which has rarely been applied in the test (Kalkan and Hurff 2012). Therefore, most of the lateral and torsional buckling experiments have attempted to use a point <b>load</b> <b>mechanism</b> to retain the initial vertical and concentrical position of the applied load without its resistance to the lateral and torsional restraints of the test beam at the loading point. Jensen (1978) initially applied a point load for the lateral and torsional buckling experiment but had difficulties in retaining the position of the applied load. Therefore, many studies (i.e., Hansell and Winter 1959; Sant and Bletzacker 1961; Massey 1967; Siev 1960; Revathi and Menon 2007 a, b) used roller bearing and ball-and-socket joint mechanisms to minimize the resistance to the lateral and rotational deformations of the test beam at the loading point during the test. Kalkan and Hurff (2012) indicated that the roller bearing <b>mechanism</b> could induce <b>load</b> eccentricity due to some difference between the centroid of the applied load and the beam when the specimen undergoes lateral deformation. Therefore, another <b>load</b> <b>mechanism</b> using a gravity load simulator, which was originally designed by Yarimci et al. (1967) to apply a vertical load to a full-scale frame experiment, was used in the lateral and torsional buckling experiments on full-scale steel I-beams (Yura and Phillips 1992; Helwig et al. 2005), composite I-beams (Stoddard 1997), and reinforced concrete beams (Kalkan 2014; Hurff and Kahn 2012). Nevertheless, the gravity load simulator also inclined the loading unit during the test, which requires an additional control mechanism to maintain the vertical line of the load.|$|R
40|$|The {{detonation}} of a buried explosive {{is known}} to be highly influenced by the conditions of the surrounding soil. Depending on the moisture content this leads to two distinct <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> being generated, that of bubble-type loading in saturated soils and shock-type loading in low moisture content soils. These mechanisms have been demonstrated numerically but without spatially and temporally resolved supporting data the veracity of the numerical models cannot be examined in detail. This paper presents the results from both global impulse and local pressure and impulse measurement tests on low moisture content and saturated sand. The testing provides data that supports the <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> allowing numerical models to be fully validated against both total impulse generated and local pressure-time histories from an array of discrete points on the loaded face...|$|R
2500|$|At the 1985 Summer CES, Nintendo {{returned}} with a stripped-down version of the AVS, having abandoned the home computer approach. Nintendo purposefully designed the system {{so as not to}} resemble a video game console, and would avoid terms associated with game consoles, using the term [...] "Pak" [...] for cartridge, or [...] "Control Deck" [...] instead of [...] "console". Renamed the [...] "Nintendo Entertainment System" [...] (NES), the new version lacked most of the upscale features added in the AVS, but retained many of its design elements, such as the grey color scheme and boxy design. In avoidance of an obvious video game connotation, NES replaced the top-loading cartridge slot of the Famicom with a front-loading chamber for software cartridges that place the inserted cartridge out of view. The revised design includes design flaws which have the side-effect of making the NES more prone to breakdown. The <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> became notorious for slowly failing. The Famicom's pair of hard-wired controllers was replaced with two custom 7-pin sockets for detachable controllers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} match the {{performance}} of the longer barreled 130mm/55 Pattern 1913 gun it was necessary to use a higher barrel pressure in the 130mm/50 B13 Pattern 1936. This led to such a rapid barrel wear that the Leningrad and Gnevny class destroyers using the first gun versions could not even empty their magazines a single time before needing to change out the barrel. The solution to the excessive barrel wear was found to be deeper rifling grooves. The original design had [...] deep grooves and a barrel life of 130 rounds; a modified version with [...] deep grooves had a barrel life of 1100 rounds. Additionally there existed a model with [...] deep grooves. The gun had 40 grooves with a constant twist. All three gun models with different groove depths had different, mutually incompatible, ammunition, sights and range tables. A loading platform that could be rotated next to the gun barrel was used to deliver the shell to a pneumatic <b>loading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The gun could be loaded on any elevation angle, but the rate of fire was reduced on elevations higher than +25°. A modified dual-purpose model with 55 caliber barrel suitable for anti-aircraft fire was planned but the project was stopped due to the war.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} the static calibration of piezoelectric dynamometer, the principle and structure of a multifunctional high-precision, high rigidity static calibration platform is manufactured in this paper. The screw <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are used to achieve vertical force and horizontal forces, and its value can directly obtained by the standard measuring ring. The torque load adopts “force × lever arm " law, that is, the two horizontal <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are relatively shifted to form force arm, {{and at the same}} time two parallel forces that have the same magnitude and opposite directions are generated. After accuracy and rigidity experiments, the static calibration platform has reached the calibration standard stipulated by CIRP-STCC.

40|$|In soccer one of {{the most}} common knee {{injuries}} is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, which usually occurs through non‐contact mechanisms. Female soccer players are at higher risk of sustaining non‐contact ACL injuries than male soccer players. A good understanding of ACL <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is the basis for a good understanding of the mechanisms of non‐contact ACL injuries, which in turn is essential for identifying risk factors and developing prevention strategies. Current literature demonstrates that sagittal plane biomechanical factors, such as small knee flexion angle, great posterior ground reaction force and great quadriceps muscle force, are the major ACL <b>loading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> A great posterior ground reaction force may be associated with a great quadriceps muscle force, which would cause great anterior draw force at the knee. A small knee flexion is associated with a large patella tendon‐tibia shaft angle and ACL elevation angle, which would result in great ACL loading. Current literature also demonstrates that the ACL is not the major structure of bearing knee valgus‐varus moment and internal‐external rotation loadings. Knee valgus‐varus moment and internal‐external rotation moment alone are not likely to result in isolated ACL injuries without injuring other knee structures...|$|R
