40|$|Land {{reform was}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} policies introduced in Latin America {{in the twentieth}} century and remains high on the political agenda due to sustained pressure from rural social movements.

This paper responds to this need by proposing a new theoretical framework to explore land reform and providing a fresh analysis of historical and contemporary land struggles in Ecuador. Drawing on <b>the</b> pioneering work <b>of</b> Karl Polanyi, <b>the</b> paper characterizes these struggles as the attempt to increase the social and political control <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> mounting commodification. <b>The</b> movement started in the 1960 s and remains evident in Ecuador today. Exploring land reform in Ecuador from this theoretical perspective provides new insight into land struggles in the country and contributes to debates over <b>land</b> reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past and present elsewhere in the Global South...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization in Kenya {{and perhaps}} in sub-Saharan Africa can be {{described}} as prescriptive rather than organic. We posit that this prescriptive urbanization can be checked and balanced by employing <b>the</b> governance model <b>of</b> devolution and rural capacity. We first review competing views on urbanization in Kenya during the colonial and postcolonial era and its contribution to disenfranchising both urban and rural inhabitants. We then examine devolution in Kenya through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> Lefebvre’s theory of production <b>of</b> space and <b>the</b> right to the city, enabling us to contextualize and redefine ‘the right to the city’. In the second part we analyze <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> rural capacity in Malaysia to absorb a large influx of return immigrants and demonstrates how they have adapted and benefited from <b>the</b> prosperity <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> diminishing energy resources and de-industrialization. We conclude that coupling devolution with rural capacity may hold the key to check rapid urbanization, especially in Kenya...|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity {{conservation}} {{on private}} <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developed world <b>faces</b> several challenges. <b>The</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are often high, and <b>the</b> attitudes <b>of</b> landowners towards conservation are variable. Scientists and practitioners need to scan for and adopt cost-effective solutions {{that allow for}} <b>the</b> long-term sustainability <b>of</b> conservation measures on private land. In this study, we focus on one of such possible solutions: Working with landowners to implement voluntary nonmonetary conservation. We restrict our focus to protection of raptor nests, but the ideas {{can be applied to}} other taxa as well. Through a literature review, we show that a voluntary nonmonetary approach for protecting raptor nests has been so far largely neglected and/or rarely reported in the scientific literature. However, results of a questionnaire sent to BirdLife partners across Europe indicate that this approach is more widely used than it appears from the literature. We show that voluntary nonmonetary approaches may represent useful tools to protect raptor nests on private land. We provide a workflow for implementation of such an approach in raptor nest protection, highlighting benefits, potential risks, and constraints in <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategy. We suggest that a voluntary nonmonetary approach may have great potential for cost-effective conservation, but the risks it may entail should be carefully assessed in each case. There is an urgent need to consider and evaluate novel approaches, such as the one described here, which may constitute missed opportunities for cost-effective conservation...|$|R
50|$|Prior to <b>the</b> {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rockefeller Museum, the British Mandate Department of Antiquities and British School of Archaeology were {{housed in}} an old building in Jerusalem with a small exhibition hall.

Encouraged by Lord Plumer, the British High Commissioner, Breasted approached American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who agreed to donate two million dollars toward the project. Previously, he had offered to build an archeological museum in Cairo, Egypt, but he was turned down, possibly due to pressure from the British government, which was anxious to keep America from establishing a foothold in the region.|$|R
30|$|At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> this earthquake, in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> study <b>the</b> {{settlements}} {{were mainly}} concentrated along the coast. This influenced <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> earthquake observations and records, in their turn concentrated in a stretch <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> sea and closed by <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dinarides in the background. This explains the rather peculiar intensity {{distribution for the}} 6 April 1667 earthquake (Fig.  6), with intensities ≥ 6 EMS 98 assigned {{to a set of}} coastal settlements aligned in a NW–SE direction, and with very scarce observations on inland localities. These aspects made the parameters’ determination particularly tricky, especially as concerns the earthquake location, and independently from the chosen method amongst the ones currently used to assess seismic parameters from macroseismic data. The new, and sound, set of macroseismic intensities was processed according to the Boxer method (Gasperini et al. 1999, 2010). This method determines <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epicentre as <b>the</b> barycenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> places with the highest intensities, and calculates the magnitude as <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> values obtained for each intensity class, considering the intensity attenuation a function of Mw and epicentral distance. The macroseismic epicentre calculated for the 6 April 1667 is close to Ragusa/Dubrovnik (42.659 °N; 18.098 °E), in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most severe effects (Fig.  6). However, an epicentre located at sea, a few kilometres from the coast, would be an alternative to contemplate. The assessed magnitude is Mw 6.4  ±  0.3, which is consistent with <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most damaged area, stretching for 100  km along the coast. Taking into account <b>the</b> peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data and <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boxer method, the resulting seismic parameters are a convincingly located epicentre and a reasonable magnitude value for the 6 April 1667 earthquake.|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> socio-economic factors in conflict in <b>the</b> San community <b>of</b> Platfontein. This article’s analysis {{is based on}} the primary data collected from individual interviews and focused group discussions conducted in 2013 and 2014. It reveals that socioeconomic factors are both <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict and serve as remedies for the conflict. The causes date back to the historical displacement and dispossession <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>the</b> community <b>faced.</b> <b>The</b> San community is highly dependent on <b>the</b> limited income <b>of</b> a few veterans while the vast majority is unemployed. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> skills and limited command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant language in the community makes them less able to compete for jobs. The community’s economic hardships are increased by the dependency syndrome shown by the adults, who tend towards job-seeking rather than job creation and self-reliance. The economic hardship has become one formidable cause <b>of</b> conflict in <b>the</b> community. A concerted effort is needed to change <b>the</b> attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community so that it becomes entrepreneurial and independent. One factor that erodes unity within the San community is that the leadership does not work closely with the people – a situation that increases <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> conflict. <b>The</b> efforts undertaken to empower the San community and lift them out of poverty are very limited. The conflict between !Xun and Khwe is attributed to the divisive political rule adopted during the apartheid regime in South Africa. Comparative economic asymmetries between !Xun and Khwe are also causes <b>of</b> conflict. Furthermore, <b>the</b> widening <b>of</b> social distance, along with competition for jobs and housing, increases the tensions and divisions between the !Xun and Khwe communities. <b>The</b> cause <b>of</b> conflict between <b>the</b> San community and other communities is also associated with unemployment and unfair treatment. Socio-economic factors are valuable ingredients in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> conflict resolution and healing <b>the</b> emotional problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflicting parties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} complex interplay between global Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the United Nations {{programme}} to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD). We examine <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two policies using a scenario approach with a recursive-dynamic global Computable General Equilibrium model. <b>The</b> consequences <b>of</b> a global biofuel directive on worldwide land use, agricultural production, international trade flows, food prices and food security out to 2030 are evaluated {{with and without}} a strict global REDD policy. We address a key methodological challenge of how to model <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> restrictions over its availability, as arises under the REDD policy. The paper introduces a flexible land supply function, which allows for large changes in the total potential land availability for agriculture. Our results show that whilst both RED and REDD are designed to reduce emissions, they have opposing impacts on land use. RED policies are found to extend land use whereas the REDD policy leads to an overall reduction in land use and intensification of agriculture. Strict REDD policies to protect forest and woodland lead to higher land prices in all regions. World food prices are slightly higher overall with some significant regional increases, notably in Southern Africa and Indonesia, leading to reductions in food security in these countries. This said, real food prices in 2030 are still lower than the 2010 level, even with the RED and REDD policies in place. Overall this suggests that RED and REDD are feasible from a worldwide perspective, although {{the results show that}} there are some regional problems that need to be resolved. The results show that countries directly affected by forest and woodland protection would be the most economically vulnerable when the REDD policy is implemented. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> REDD policies reduces global trade in agricultural products and moves some developing countries to a net importing position for agricultural products. This suggests that <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> forests and woodlands in these regions reverses their comparative advantage as they move from being land-abundant to land-scarce regions. The full REDD policy setting, however, foresees providing compensation to these countries to cover their economic losses...|$|R
