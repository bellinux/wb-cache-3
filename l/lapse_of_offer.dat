40|$|BACKGROUND: Attentional {{processes}} in children {{play a critical}} role in daily school demands and accomplishments. Studies on the association of attentional processes with school achievement and age in healthy school children are scarce. The aim of the present study was to identify correlations between dimensions of attentional performance, scholastic achievement and age. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An extensive testing battery was used to assess a wide range of attentional dimensions. A principal component analysis revealed three factors that are related to attentional performance (distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention, cognitive speed). Age was negatively associated with distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed, indicating that distractibility and <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention decreased with age in healthy children and resulted in lower cognitive speed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Attentional {{processes in}} healthy children should be measured in relation to distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many high-risk occupations, it is {{critical}} that a person remains alert at all times. There is much to be gained by being able to monitor a person on-line and detect <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (LoC) so that remedial action can be taken (e. g., a rest break) to ensure that safety is maintained. In this study, 15 normal subjects were observed on two sessions while they performed a continuous tracking task for a period of 1 hour. EEG, eye movements, tracking performance data and a video of the subject were recorded during the session. This paper presents some preliminary results on the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>lapsing.</b> Only 4 <b>of</b> the 15 subjects did not have a LoC at some stage. Seven subjects had LoCs more than 45 times and 4 more than 100 times during the 2 hours. The mean rate <b>of</b> <b>lapsing</b> over all subjects was 29. 1 LoC/h. In contrast, lapses in performance were caused by both <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (30. 1 %) and attention (69. 9 %). There was no correlation found between age of subject and number <b>of</b> <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness. Keywords—Alertness, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, visuomotor tracking...|$|R
