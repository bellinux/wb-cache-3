40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with double layered <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars,</b> bond-strengthening hooks and 1300 MPa-class spirals. The hooks made of mild steel increased the bond strength along <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars.</b> This experiment {{is aimed at}} quantification of not only {{the effectiveness of the}} spirals and bond-strengthening hooks on the RC members consisting of double layered <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> but also the influence of cut-off bars in an inner (second) layer. Twelve specimens were prepared and subjected to cyclic shear loads. All the specimens failed because of bond splitting along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars.</b> The hooks, made of mild steel, increased the bond strength along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars.</b> Applying the bond-strengthening hooks was found to improve the shear capacities of the specimens with the cut-off bars.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to reduce {{production}} costs for UHPFRC members by using a bundle of <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement <b>bars</b> as a substitute for steel fiber. Experiments on the ductile behavior of Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) rectangular beams with a combination of steel fiber and <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement <b>bars</b> were performed. The volume fractions of steel fiber were 0 %, 0. 7 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %, and the reinforcement ratios of <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement <b>bars</b> that promoted ductile behavior were 0. 0036, 0. 016, 0. 029 and 0. 036. Fifteen UHPC beams were made with the combination of these test factors. Both the steel fiber and the <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement <b>bars</b> had the effect of induciing ductile behavior for UHPC structural members. The load-deflection relationship, the concrete stress variation and the crack pattern indicated the usefulness of the bundle of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> that have a small diameter with close arrangement...|$|R

30|$|As for columns bend {{in double}} {{curvature}} modes as groups No. 3 and 4, {{none of them}} developed tensile strain in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> at the mid-height section. That {{can be attributed to}} the minimal effect of the developed bending moment at these sections, where the maximum stressed section were near the supports as depicted in Figs.  5 and 6. As illustrated in Table  2, it can be noted that increasing the end eccentricities resulted in decreasing the developed compressive strain on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> at the mid-height section due to increase the bending moment effect.|$|R

There is a nearly straight transverse light ochreous-yellow median streak, slightly interrupted in the middle beneath a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> crossing it, a curved mark beyond this limiting the transverse vein posteriorly. An irregular ochreous-yellow spot is found on the costa about two-thirds, and another on the costa before the apex, where a bisinuate streak runs near the termen to the tornus.

The hindwings are prismatic hyaline, with the veins dark fuscous and with a dark fuscous apical blotch occupying one-fourth to one-third of the wing, and reaching the middle of the termen, the terminal edge below this suffusedly dark fuscous.|$|E

30|$|Inspite {{that the}} maximum {{stressed}} section {{was not the}} same for all tested columns depending on the end eccentricities combinations, the developed normal strains on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> were measured at the mid-height section. Based on the used steel type, the yield strain of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> is 2069 micro-strain. Since the column C- 0 - 0 was short in both directions, i.e., the effect of slenderness is minimal, the developed strains along the entire height of the reinforcing bars should reach the yielding point at failure. That happened, as expected, where the measured compressive strain near failure was 2247 micro-strain for column C- 0 - 0.|$|R
30|$|Increases in beam heights {{significantly}} increase the beam action mechanisms of the substructures.

40|$|Internal {{transverse}} steel reinforcements (e. g. stirrups) are {{the main}} internal devices that avoid the longitudinal steel bar buckling, but in many existing RC structures the amount and the spacing between steel stirrups are inadequate. In these structures <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> buckling can be avoided by applying external reinforcement, in particular, by means of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wrapping. A novel analytical approach {{for the study of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> buckling in columns wrapped with FRP is proposed. Longitudinal bars have been considered as axially loaded beams, while the mechanical effect of FRP wrapping on the bars has been modeled by means of springs. The effect of elastic and inelastic behavior has been taken into account by means of the reduced modulus theory. The well-known relations for steel stirrups have been revisited in the case of FRP wrapping to propose an analytical formulation, valid both for circular and noncircular cross sections of columns, for the evaluation of the FRP thickness needed to avoid the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> buckling...|$|E

30|$|A {{full-scale}} RC {{bridge pier}} subjected to series of six incremental ground motions developed by PEER and NEES (PEER 2010) {{as part of}} a blind prediction contest was selected. The input ground motions commenced with the low intensity excitations succeeded by high intensity motions to bring the bridge pier to the incipient collapse state. The numerical model was verified adopting the proposed recommendations by Bianchi et al. (2011). Figure  9 c demonstrates the capability of the numerical model in reproducing the dynamic hysteresis behavior of the studied bridge pier. The selected bridge pier specimen exhibits significantly high level of nonlinearity (both material inelasticity and geometric nonlinearity). Damage was observed in the form of concrete spalling, concrete cracking, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> buckling (thirteen of the eighteen bars were buckled), and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bar</b> fracture in the plastic hinge region formed at column-footing interface (Schoettler et al. 2012). The numerical model could successfully capture the seismic response of the pier specimen subjected to six seismic sequences of various intensities.|$|E

Yielding of steel spirals or hoops and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bars</b> including buckling phenomena and damage to the concrete core are also considered by means of variation in the elastic modulus and in the Poisson's coefficient.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to propose simple and {{reliable}} method to predict the buckling length of <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> and also to predict the spalling of cover concrete in reinforced concrete members.
