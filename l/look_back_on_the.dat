I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia. Simon writes: [...] "What was the most horrible summer {{in the life of}} a young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E

Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marriage debate [...] "with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was". Also that year, he remarked that it was [...] "outrageous and offensive" [...] to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign. Affleck filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans, in 2007.|$|E

In the meantime, bassist John Entwistle released his second solo album, Whistle Rymes, singer Roger Daltrey worked on solo material, and Keith Moon featured as a drummer in the film That'll Be The Day. Townshend had met up with [...] "Irish" [...] Jack Lyons, {{one of the original}} Who fans, which gave him the idea of writing a piece that would <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> group's history and its audience. He created the character of Jimmy from an amalgamation of six early fans of the group, including Lyons, and gave the character a four-way split personality, which led to the album's title (a play on schizophrenia).|$|E

[...] Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel Visions of Cody, which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.|$|E

2500|$|Potentially in {{contrast}} to Prime Minister Abe's example of his Yasukuni Shrine visits, by February 2015 some concern within the Imperial House of Japan — which normally does not issue such statements — over the issue was voiced by Crown Prince Naruhito.

However, two recent visits to the Yasukuni shrine {{in the second half of}} 2016 by Japan's current foreign minister, Masahiro Imamura, was again followed by controversy that still shows potential for concern over how Japan's World War II history may be remembered by its citizens.|$|E
2500|$|However, Powell {{lost his}} seat in the {{election}} by 731 votes to the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign {{for the number of}} MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion {{for the rest of the}} United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, [...] "For the rest of my life when I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: [...] "What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue". When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: [...] "My opponent polled more votes than me".|$|E
