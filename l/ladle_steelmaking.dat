40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} {{well known that}} a <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> operation {{plays an important role}} in the production of clean steel. A turbulent mixing of melt with Ar gas bubbling from the ladle bottom can homogenize a melt temperature and can control precisely chemical compositions of steel. In order to figure out these phenomena, a quantitative analysis of fluid flow behavior of gas and melt during a ladle operation is required and special concerns should be focused on effects of operating parameters on the perfect mixing time of melt. In this study, as a basic approach, effects of operating parameters such as a melt depth (aspect ratio) and a nozzle type (one-hole or porous plug) on the mixing behavior in ladle operation are investigated. Water model experiments are carried out to simulate these melt behaviors in <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle.</b> As a result, it was found that there exist an optimized melt depth and a nozzle type at a given gas flow rate, which affect significantly on the mixing behavior of melt...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic free lance, {{discovered}} accidentally in 2005, is a {{new type}} of injection lance with its top-end connected with a flexible joint so that the lance tip could move during the gas injection. Without mechanical driving apparatus, the free lance is capable of injection of reagent into wide space of the bath. The investigation of the free lance indicated that the lance movement caused forceful interaction of the injection gas with the liquid phase, and jet trajectory was changed due to the drag force from the liquid phase. A lance with weight of 15 kg and length of 2 m has been used as the free lance for modeling study, indicating that the heavy free lance for the industry could achieve certain extent of movement for dispersion injection, and this prediction has been proved in 2012 by industrial application of the 9 meters free lance used for the injection modification of end-slag from BOF converter.

40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} {{the high cost of}} bauxite, Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C {{refractory}} bricks (AMC) are widely used for steelmaking vessel working linings due to their excellent properties: high temperature mechanical strength and high resistances to both thermal spalling and slag corrosion. In part, these properties stem from the thermal evolution of the phases and the microstructure of AMC refractories, such as the transformation of the aluminum metal (usually added as antioxidant) in Al 4 C 3 and the formation of spinel (MgAl 2 O 4). In this work, the thermal evolution of the phases of three different AMC commercial bricks used in sidewalls and bottom of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladles</b> between 400 and 1400 ¡C in air was studied.

Through appropriate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, the intermixing of fluid within gas-stirred ladles can be modelled quite satisfactorily.

40|$|Abstract. Flow {{patterns}} and mixing behaviors in a gas stirred <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> with a slag layer were discussed using a water model experiment {{as well as}} a numerical simulation. While the water model experiment was performed to investigate the effect of slag on the mixing behavior in ladle, the numerical simulation was carried out to figure out the flow pattern in ladle with a slag layer. Slag viscosity and its thickness in ladle were considered as major variables. It was found that a slag layer made a great change in the flow pattern in ladle, which, in turn, affected on the mixing behavior in ladle. A flow pattern without a slag layer showed that rising bubbles eventually made a recirculation loop at the central area of the ladle and this flow pattern was regarded as a favorable flow pattern for the better mixing behavior. However, a flow pattern with a slag layer showed distorted and localized recirculating loop near side wall below slag layer. This eventually gave a longer mixing time in ladle with a slag layer. Moreover, as the gas flow rate increases, slag existing on top of the ladle was found to be entrained into the melt. Slag viscosity and its thickness were found to be major variables affecting the behavior of slag entrainment. Lower the slag viscosity and thicker the slag layer, much more slag on top of the melt was entrained into the melt...|$|R
40|$|Sintered and fused {{magnesia}} (MgO) are primary ingredients of MgO-C and Mag-Chrome bricks used for steel processing furnaces, for example BOF, EAF, and ladles. Magnesia clinker exhibits brilliant blue or red CL colors in these bricks. The blue CL color is generally interpreted {{to be produced}} by lattice defects or intrinsic properties of MgO crystal. The red CL color is related to impurity centers. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mn 4 + activators are known to produce red CL color in MgO. Red to blue or blue to red CL color changes in MgO clinkers in MgO-C refractories from slag line of ladle or BOF, in fact, represent changes in local atmosphere within the refractory brick. In a reducing surrounding local CO atmosphere (in {{the center of the}} brick), the valence state of these transition metal ions are easily reduced and the blue CL is enhanced. Similarly, in an oxidized environment where free O 2 and CO 2 are predominant gaseous species, MgO grains in MgO-C and Mag-Chrome brick generally produce red CL color.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{a study on}} the thermal state of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladles</b> was undertaken. The {{transient}} hot wire method was verified for thermal conductivity measurements on metallurgical slags and applied to ladle slag measurements. Temperature measurements on ladles in an industrial environment were carried out. The emissivities of the outer and inner shells of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladles</b> were investigated. Two dynamic models were developed to predict the heat transfer and fluid flow in a preheating and teeming ladle. The gathered thermal conductivity values for ladle slag were used to study the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt on heat transfer and fluid flow in a teeming ladle. In the first stage, the transient hot-wire method was verified to measure the thermal conductivity of metallurgical slags at steelmaking temperatures. A numerical model was developed, cold model experiments were conducted and test measurements using a high temperature experimental setup were carried out. To minimize natural convection and to obtain more reliable measurements, the crucible diameter, the hot-wire diameter, the applied current, the position of the wire in the crucible and the cooling on the upper surface of the crucible were studied. Investigations into the choice of sheathing material of the circuit exposed to the slag were also made. It was found that only certain materials were suitable for slag measurements depending on slag composition and temperature. The electrical resistivity of the hot wire was measured to make the thermal conductivity calculation more reliable. The wire diameter also played a major role due to the heat generation per surface area. The thermal conductivity should be derived from the values measured during the first seconds. In this initial stage, the effect of the natural convection {{as a function of the}} wire position in the crucible, the cooling on the top surface and the diameter of the crucible are negligible. A compromise has to be made in choosing the electrical current, since higher current results in higher sensitivity but at the same time in more natural convection. In the second stage, the thermal conductivities of four different ladle slags were measured at 1773 K, 1823 K, 1873 K and 1923 K using the transient hot wire method. Very good reproducibility was obtained. The thermal conductivity did not vary substantially with the variation of slag composition at 1873 K and 1923 K, at which the slag samples were all entirely liquid. The thermal conductivities were low. It was found that the precipitation of solid phase resulted in a considerable increase of thermal conductivity. In the third stage, a two dimensional model was developed in order to predict the temperature distribution in the ladle wall during the preheating process. The model calculated the heat transfer and the velocity field in the gas phase inside the ladle as well as the heat transfer in the solid walls during the preheating process. Measurements of the temperature profiles in an industrial ladle were carried out using an infrared thermography. The measurements were made both inside and outside the ladle. The model predictions were found to be in reasonably good agreement with the measured temperatures. It was found that the preheating time could be minimized when the working lining became thinner. The effect ofthe distance between the lid and the ladle was also studied by the model. The results indicated that there was no significant temperature change on the upper side wall of the ladle. On the lower side wall and bottom the temperature changed slightly. The temperature difference in the lower part of the ladle could be explained by the larger flame distance from the bottom layer. In the fourth stage, a two dimensional axisymmetric model was developed to predict the heat flux in a <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> during the teeming process. The model predicts dynamically the flow fields in both the liquid phase and the gas phase along with the movement of the liquid upper surface. The model also predicts the temperature distributions in the liquid metal, gas phase and all layers in the ladle wall. Again, industrial measurements were performed using an infrared thermography, both inside the ladle after teeming and at the wall outside the ladle during the whole process sequence. The model predictions were found to be in agreement with the measured data. It was found that the heat transfer to the surrounding atmosphere and the conductivity of the highly insulating layer were the most important factors for the heat loss. The decrease of the thickness of the working lining was found to have limited effect on the total heat flux. In the fifth and final stage, the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt, on fluid flow and on heat transfer in a teeming ladle was investigated theoretically. The two dimensional axisymmetric model developed in the fourth stage was used. To predict the effect of the slag layer a stationary heat conduction boundary condition including thermal conductivity and slag layer thickness was employed. Different calculations with differing thermal conductivity values for the slag layer were carried out. The calculations showed that the effect of the slag layer was insignificant. This could be explained by the similarity of the thermal conductivity of slag and gas phase. QC 20121010 </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{liquid steel}} {{sampling}} method {{is one of}} the commonly used procedures in monitoring the steelmaking process. Besides it can be used for analyzing the dissolved alloys, hydrogen content and oxygen content, it can be also employed to monitor the inclusion characteristics at the steelmakings. Here, a crucial point is that the steel sampler should be filled and the metal solidifies without changing the inclusion characteristics. Therefore, the objective of this work is to fundamentally understand the liquid steel sampling process by means of analyzing and modeling the two-phase flow during the sampler filling process, and verifying the mathematical model by using the experimental data. The present dissertation presents an experimental and theoretical study of the filling process of both the lollipop-shaped sampler and the rectangular-shaped sampler. Firstly, a physical modeling by using a water model has been carried out to fundamentally investigate the flow pattern inside the sampler vessels during its filling. The flow patterns were obtained by a PIV system. Then, a mathematical model has been built to theoretically understand the phenomena. The commercial CFD code was used. Here, different turbulence model have been compared between the realizable k-ε turbulence model and Wilcox k-ω turbulence model. It concludes that the Wilcox k-ω turbulence model agrees well with the PIV measurements. HH Thus, the preferred it was further employed to predict the turbulent flow inside the production lollipop-shaped sampler fillings. It is important to find that the average collision volume in the production steel sampler without solidification at filling is about 30 times higher than that in a ladle furnace. In the end, the whole sampling system was modeled. The initial solidification during the filling was taken into account. Focus was on the influence of the initial solidification on the inclusion concentrations. A discrete phase model was used to simulate the movement of inclusions in the liquid steel. Some selected different sized primary inclusions that exist in the <b>ladles</b> at a <b>steelmaking</b> process were simulated. The same method of studying the filling procedure of the lollipop-shaped sampler was further applied to comprehensively investigate the rectangular-shaped sampler. QC 2010090...|$|R
