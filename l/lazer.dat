500|$|... "Run the World (Girls)" [...] is {{a complex}} but catchy track that's {{actually}} more reminiscent of M.I.A. and Santigold than Sasha Fierce. The song combines a dancefloor-defying military drumbeat, a sample from Switch's group Major <b>Lazer,</b> an unconventional song structure and some incongruously pretty, layered melodics that are basically chanted but still employ [...] full vocal range. The lyrics, however, are just as female-empowering as we've come to expect. There's much more to the song than first meets the ear—it confuses on first listen but coalesces beautifully with repeated plays.|$|E
500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] is a dance-pop {{track with}} themes of indie pop, {{and has been}} {{compared}} to the work of M.I.A. and Daphne & Celeste. The verses, choruses and bridge are all distinctively different; the chorus consists of chants, the verses are spoken-sung (half spoken. half sung), and the bridge are dancehall themed. The bridge gathered comparisons to the music of Major <b>Lazer,</b> which it samples. The vocals are performed against sirens. Music journalist James Montgomery observed how the song [...] "mashes together every notable pop moment from recent history", pointing out the dancehall rhythms, drum breaks and [...] "electro-vocal tics".|$|E

500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] is a dance-pop song which {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} indie pop, {{and has been}} compared to the work of artists including M.I.A. and Major <b>Lazer.</b> Lyrically, the song discusses Roberts' time in the girl band she was a part of, Girls Aloud; while part of the group, she felt undervalued in comparison to other members. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] garnered universal acclaim from music critics, with some describing it as more original than solo releases by other members of Girls Aloud; it was also compared to the work of artists such as Kelis and Robyn. Commercially, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] failed to make a large impact.|$|E
500|$|... "Run the World" [...] is a electropop and R {{song that}} heavily samples [...] "Pon de Floor" [...] by Major <b>Lazer.</b> The song's title and lyrics {{comprise}} an unapologetically aggressive message promoting female empowerment. [...] "Run the World" [...] initially divided critics; some complimented the song's sample, its musical direction, and Beyoncé's aggressiveness, while others criticized {{the continuation of}} past themes and stated {{that they wanted to}} see Beyoncé covering new topics. Several critics compared [...] "Run the World" [...] to Beyoncé's other singles with similar themes such as [...] "Independent Women" [...] (2000) – with Destiny's Child, and [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008) among others, stating that [...] "Run the World" [...] takes a more direct and assertive approach towards female empowerment.|$|E

During the break, each member pursued individual projects: Baio performed DJ sets and scored the Bob Byington film Somebody Up There Likes Me, Batmanglij recorded solo material and produced tracks for Das Racist and spent time traveling India with three friends, and Koenig collaborated with Major <b>Lazer.</b> Koenig had broken up with his girlfriend shortly before the release of Contra and subsequently moved out of their shared apartment in New York.
