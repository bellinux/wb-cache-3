25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. This new type of <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, {{this is not just a}} minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E
25|$|In Taoism, the Seven-Star Lamp qi xing deng 七星燈 is a seven-lamp oil <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> to {{represent}} the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. This lampstand is a requirement for all Taoist temples, never to be extinguished. In the first 9 days of the lunar 9th month festival, an oil lamp of nine connected lamps may also be lit to honour both the Northern Dipper and two other assistant stars (collectively known as the Nine Emperor Stars), sons of Dou Mu appointed by the Taoist Trinity (the Three Pure Ones) to hold the Books of Life and Death of humanity. The lamps represent the illumination of the 7 stars, and lighting them are believed to absolve sins while prolonging one's lifespan.|$|E

50|$|We {{may assume}} that only finitely many <b>lamps</b> are <b>lit</b> at any time, since {{the action of}} any element of L changes at most finitely many lamps. The number of <b>lamps</b> <b>lit</b> is, however, unbounded. The group action is thus similar to the action of a Turing machine.|$|R
500|$|Baba {{is known}} to have grown, nurtured and {{cultivated}} a garden called [...] during his lifetime. The garden was watered daily by Baba himself. Lendi Baug got its name from a well known river which used to previously flow there. The garden was full of trees and flowering plants that included a rose garden where deer and rabbits roamed about. Baba went to Lendi Baug daily and every day he threw some silver coins in the 'Lendi' ('Well'). Baba was also known to test his devotees to see if they hankered after money and gold. Baba used to come here every morning and afternoon entering alone through the west and rest under a Neem tree. Sai Baba also dug a pit, 2 feet deep, under the Neem tree and kept an earthen <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> continuously. Lendi Baug also has a well which was dug by Baba and his devotees.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "Widow's Lamp" [...] is lit {{and remains}} {{hanging on the}} arch until the last {{competitor}} crosses the finish line. The tradition {{is based on the}} kerosene <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> and hung outside a roadhouse, when a musher carrying goods or mail was en route. For this reason, the last musher to complete the Iditarod {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Red Lantern".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1977 NHL Amateur Draft, he {{was passed}} over by twelve teams, with the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs {{ignoring}} him twice. However, the New York Islanders made him their first choice, 15th overall. General manager Bill Torrey was torn at first between taking Bossy and Dwight Foster. [...] Bossy {{was known as}} a scorer who could not check, while Foster could check but was inferior offensively. Coach Al Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, figuring it was easier to teach a scorer how to check. Bossy was placed on a line with Bryan Trottier and Clark Gillies, a combination that would {{come to be known as}} The Trio Grande, replacing Billy Harris on a line that had been called the [...] "LILCO line" [...] (standing for [...] "Long Island Lighting Company", since their prolific scoring kept the goal <b>lamp</b> <b>lit).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hidalgo is {{hailed as}} the Father of the Nation {{even though it was}} Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who {{achieved}} Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The {{reason for this is that}} Hidalgo is considered to be [...] "precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence." [...] Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country. [...] Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of September 15–16, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City. Next to it is a <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence.|$|E

Kerosene <b>lamps</b> <b>lit</b> buildings, as electricity did not arrive until a second condo, Los Cocos, was developed. For many years, running water was not available, and water had to be trucked in.|$|R
50|$|To {{the ancient}} Israelite {{there was no}} oil or fat with more {{symbolic}} meaning than olive oil.

It was scented olive oil which was chosen to be a holy anointing oil for the Israelites.|$|R
50|$|Calvin Knowlton {{was brought}} in to rebuild the tower. He oversaw its completion, and in 1831, Williams, {{satisfied}} that the light was built according to the contract, accepted the work.

60|$|The {{rays of the}} {{acetylene}} <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> up the way fairly well, {{and here}} and there they could see their former trail, although it was growing more indistinct every moment. The wind now whistled through the pines and spruces,--a sound as dismaying as it was lonely.|$|E

50|$|The Shift Up lamp can {{be found}} on OBD II cars. The lamp helps the driver to drive economically. The lamp is {{supplied}} by ignition power (+15) and is grounded in the Trionic ECU, pin 55. The Shift Up <b>Lamp</b> is <b>lit</b> when the ignition is turned on for three seconds to test the circuit. During normal driving the <b>lamp</b> is <b>lit</b> when reaching a specific RPM while driving at light loads. At wide-open-throttle the Shift Up <b>lamp</b> is <b>lit</b> when the RPM is near 6000 RPM. The lamp does not light in fifth gear. The light is lit at a higher RPM when the engine is cold to promote a quicker warm up.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} mostly clad in Finnish granite, and its {{distinguishing}} features are its clock tower {{and the two}} pairs of statues holding the spherical <b>lamps,</b> <b>lit</b> at night-time, {{on either side of}} the main entrance. Animated characters based on the statues have recently been featured in some major advertising campaigns by Finland's government-owned railway operator VR, to the extent of releasing rap singles allegedly sung by Kivimiehet ("The stone men").|$|R

He {{wanted to know if}} I was open to hire him a team for a night or two." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he heard}} his landlady behind him, coming with his <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> from the kitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped her {{at the door of}} his sitting-room. He had some {{difficulty}} in explaining the situation in whispers, for she did not know he had a visitor. She retreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to judge from her manner, and he resumed his hovering {{at the corner of the}} porch, flushed and less at his ease.|$|E
60|$|To {{reach it}} {{he passed the}} gates of 'Sylvania,' and {{observed}} above the lawn wall a board announcing {{that the house was}} to be let furnished. A few steps further revealed the cottage which with its quaint and massive stone features of two or three centuries' antiquity, was capable even now of longer resistance to the rasp of Time than ordinary new erections. His attention was drawn to the window, still unblinded, though a <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> the room. He stepped back against the wall opposite, and gazed in.|$|E
5000|$|Over 225 tonnes {{of metal}} {{were used in}} {{building}} the ride, which used a steel support structure instead of the more traditional wood. Having said this, it is still considered a [...] "woodie", due {{to the construction of}} the track (300 X 25 millimetre wood laminants topped by a flat steel rail). Total length of wood used was about 6,100 metres - all British Columbia fir. At night, 1,000 small incandescent <b>lamps</b> <b>lit</b> the ride.|$|R

'This is comfort, indeed,' he said, as he rubbed his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may argue--but I {{have too}} much respect for your judgment, Watson, {{to think that you}} will do so--that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we {{conceive}} of his giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the <b>lamp</b> <b>lit.</b> Of that I have no doubt at all.|$|E
60|$|Like {{every other}} passage in this old fortress, the {{approach}} to the cave was narrow and winding; presumably the ancients had arranged them thus to facilitate their defence. After the third bend, however, Benita saw a light ahead which flowed from a native <b>lamp</b> <b>lit</b> in the arched entrance. At the side of this arch was a shell-shaped hollow, cut in the rock about three feet above the floor. Its appearance seemed familiar to her; why, she was soon to learn, although at the moment she did not connect it with anything in particular. The cave beyond was large, lofty, and not altogether natural, for its walls had evidently been shaped, or at any rate trimmed, by man. Probably here the old Priests had established their oracle, or place of offering.|$|E
