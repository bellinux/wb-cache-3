5|$|The exact <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> between {{domestic}} sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is {{descended from the}} Asiatic (O. orientalis) species of mouflon. It has been proposed that the European mouflon (O. musimon) is an ancient breed of {{domestic sheep}} turned feral rather than an ancestor, despite its commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature. A few breeds of sheep, such as the Castlemilk Moorit from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding with wild European mouflon.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} pursued under his successors and grandchildren Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I, with the crown now passing {{down the main}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> through primogeniture, leading to {{the first of a}} series of minorities. The {{benefits}} of greater authority were reaped by William's son Alexander II and his son Alexander III, who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following Haakon Haakonarson's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the Battle of Largs with the Treaty of Perth in 1266.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

40|$|Kingman derived the Ewens {{sampling}} {{formula for}} random partitions from the genealogy model {{defined by a}} Poisson process <b>of</b> mutations along <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> governed by a simple coalescent process. Möhle described the recursion which determines the generalization of the Ewens sampling formula when the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> are governed by a coalescent with multiple collisions. In [7] authors exploit an analogy with the theory of regenerative composition and partition structures, and provide various characterizations of the associated exchangeable random partitions.

5|$|Sulaiman, Khalid's eldest son, {{was killed}} during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, {{although}} other sources claim he was slain during the Muslim siege of Diyarbakir in 639.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and {{it can be argued that}} this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
