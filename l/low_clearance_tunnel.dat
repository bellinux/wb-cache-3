A {{combination}} of <b>low</b> <b>clearances</b> through the <b>tunnel</b> and increasing traffic volumes on the Old Road, especially after 1900, led the Lackawanna Railroad to take desperate measures—such {{as the use}} of gauntlet track through the tunnel—in order to minimize delays. In the end, the building of the Lackawanna Cut-Off would be the only solution that worked.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{successful}} dome {{design in the}} United States was the [...] "Vista Dome", which began test runs in 1945. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad ("CB&Q") rebuilt a stainless steel Budd-built coach in their shops in Aurora, Illinois, with the Vista Dome design imagined and sketched by Cyrus Osborn. The dome area featured seats positioned lengthwise in the cabin facing double-pane windows which were designed to improve insulation. While popular with travelers, dome cars {{could not be used}} on most railroads in the Eastern United States because of the <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> on various <b>tunnels.</b> Even the low-slung [...] "Strata-Domes", designed by Pullman-Standard for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, could not travel north of Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|When Amtrak {{took over}} in 1971, {{lightweight}} combines were used on most routes, particularly on trains which had used combines before Amtrak took over. As Amtrak started rehabbing their older cars to Heritage Fleet standards, the only combines which survived were the Baggage-Dorm cars. As Amtrak received the Superliner cars in all forms, including dorm cars, the only routes which required rehabbed single-level dorm cars were the East Coast routes (Crescent, Lake Shore Limited, Silver Star, etc.) due to <b>low</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance.</b> Because Amtrak had a surplus of single-level coaches due to the recent delivery of Amfleet coaches, baggage-coaches were unnecessary. Thus, baggage-dorm cars were the only cars that should logically be rehabbed. Rehabbed baggage-dorm cars were used on Amtrak East Coast routes from the early 1980s until 1996.|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from}} Elsevier at [URL] trucks are continuously striking <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> overpasses and <b>tunnels.</b> This has led to significant damage, fatalities, and inconvenience to the public. Smart systems can automatically detect and warn oversize trucks, and have been introduced to provide the trucks {{with the opportunity to}} avoid a collision. However, high cost of implementing these systems remains a bottleneck for their wide adoption. This paper evaluates the feasibility of using computer vision to detect over-height trucks. In the proposed method, video streams are collected from a surveillance camera attached on the overpass/tunnel, and processed to measure truck heights. The height is measured using line detection and blob tracking which locate upper and lower points of a truck in pixel coordinates. The pixel coordinates are then translated into 3 D world coordinates. Proof-of concept experiment results signify the high performance of the proposed method and its potential in achieving cost-effective monitoring of over-height trucks in the transportation system. The limitations and considerations of the method for field implementation are also discussed. This material is based upon work supported by West Virginia University, Myongji University, and University of Cambridge...|$|R
50|$|On January 8, 1902 fifteen New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad commuters from New Rochelle {{were killed}} when a local New York Central Railroad train from White Plains missed a red light and rear-ended the train stopped in Park Avenue Tunnel. The {{accident}} was linked to exhaust smoke obstructing view of traffic signals. The resulting public outcry led to calls for electrification {{of the line and}} replacement of the then-overcrowded Grand Central Depot. In 1903 state legislators passed a law banning steam locomotives from Manhattan after June 30, 1908 and demanding electrification of New York Central Railroad (NYCRR). The company, which had already contemplated electrification, introduced electric traction on its Manhattan trunk lines in the end of 1906. The NYCRR mainline employed third rail electric supply because <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> in the <b>tunnels</b> ruled out use of overhead lines. The trains changed electric locomotives for steam engines at Croton-Harmon and North White Plains. Other incoming trunk lines were largely electrified by 1923. The isolated Staten Island Railway, operated by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, remained powered by outdated coal-fired 4-4-0 camelbacks and 2-4-4Ts hauling wooden cars.|$|R

Consequently, some roofless and even open tri-levels and bi-levels remained in service into the mid-late 1980s.|$|R

Four <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> underpasses along a congested arterial in Honolulu were modeled with Integration. Travel time and fuel savings benefits accrued during two peak hours on workdays {{are expected to}} outweigh implementation costs in two to five years. <b>Low</b> <b>clearance</b> underpasses were estimated to be about 40 % shorter in length and cost approximately $ 3 million less to construct compared with standard underpasses...|$|R

Second choice is Rayleigh step because of combined higher operating film thickness and good stiffness at <b>low</b> <b>clearance.</b> Recess hydrostatic has reasonable performance, but stiffness falls off at <b>low</b> <b>clearance.</b> Also, pneumatic hammer characteristics must be investigated. Experience at high pressure ratios is limited. An advantage {{is that it would}} have good low speed performance...|$|R

The exceptions involved transporter-mediated uptake clearance or metabolizing enzymes with extensive extrahepatic contribution. This is the first assay available to address <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> challenges in preclinical species for IVIVC in drug discovery.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of predialysis patients default on nephrology clinic appointments. Characteristics and implications for discontinuing predialysis care are not well understood. Our case-control study investigated the determinants of patients who defaulted at a <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> clinic and their effects on patient outcomes. The subjects (n = 36) were those who defaulted on appointments at a <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> clinic without a medical reason. Controls were the other 76 attendees of the clinic. Patients who defaulted were younger, had lower Charlson Co-morbidity Index scores but similar Davies scores, {{and were more likely}} to be single. In the multivariable logistic regression model, age was independently associated with the odds of defaulting (adjusted odds ratio for each 10 -year increment of decreasing age was 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval 1. 11 – 1. 90). Cox proportional model analysis showed that age and smoking history were the only variables associated with all-cause mortality. Patient survival appeared not to be affected by the history of defaulting at the <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> clinic. Our findings confirm that young age is the single most important independent factor for predicting the behavior of defaulting on clinic appointments...|$|R

The experimental {{results show that the}} honeycomb stator configuration is more stable than the smooth stator configuration at low rotor speeds. At high rotor speeds and <b>low</b> <b>clearance,</b> the smooth stator seal is more stable. The theoretical model predicts the cross-coupled stiffness of the honeycomb stator seal correctly within 25 percent of measured values. The model provides accurate predictions of direct damping for large clearance seals.

40|$|Railway <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> is {{directly}} related to the safe operation of trains and upgrading of freight capacity. As more and more railway are put into operation and the operation is continuously becoming faster, the railway <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> inspection should be more precise and efficient. In view of the problems existing in traditional <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> inspection methods, such as low density, slow speed and a lot of manual operations, this paper proposes a <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> inspection approach based on 3 D point clouds obtained by a mobile laser scanning system (MLS). First, a dynamic coordinate system for railway <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> inspection has been proposed. A rail line extraction algorithm based on 3 D linear fitting is implemented from the segmented point cloud to establish a dynamic clearance coordinate system. Second, a method to seamlessly connect all rail segments based on the railway clearance restrictions, and a seamless rail alignment is formed sequentially from the middle tunnel section to both ends. Finally, based on the rail alignment and the track clearance coordinate system, different types of clearance frames are introduced for intrusion operation with the tunnel section to realize the <b>tunnel</b> <b>clearance</b> inspection. By taking the Shuanghekou Tunnel of the Chengdu–Kunming Railway as an example, when the clearance inspection is carried out by the method mentioned herein, its precision can reach 0. 03 m, and difference types of clearances can be effectively calculated. This method has a wide application prospects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of pointshell {{shrinking}} and feature size on manual assembly operations in a virtual environment with haptic force feedback. Specific emphasis is on exploring methods to improve voxel-based modeling to support manual assembly of <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> parts. CAD parts were created, voxelized and tested for assembly. The results showed that pointshell shrinking allows the engineer to assemble parts with a lower clearance than without pointshell shrinking. Further results showed that assemble-ability is dependent on feature size, particularly part diameter and clearance. In a pin and hole assembly, as the pin diameter increases, for a given percent <b>clearance,</b> assembling <b>low</b> <b>clearance</b> features becomes difficult. An empirical equation is developed to guide the designer in selecting an appropriate voxel size based on feature size. These results advance the effort to improve manual assembly operations via haptic feedback in the virtual environment...|$|R
