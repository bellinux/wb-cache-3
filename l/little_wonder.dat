25|$|It is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> {{that many}} desperate Devonians tried their luck abroad, with the sailing ship Elizabeth, Isabella and Margaret taking emigrants from Torquay Harbour to America and Canada. Those {{they left behind}} faced a bleak future of low pay in {{insecure}} employment with few rights. The basic diet of working-class families in those days consisted mainly of bread and whatever else could be had, usually cheese and a few vegetables, so when the staple food supply was scarce or too expensive to buy then just surviving was made even harder.|$|E
25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was <b>little</b> <b>wonder,</b> therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the many}} signs and symptoms, the {{generally}} delayed diagnosis, {{and the possibility}} of residual complaints after treatment, it is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves' disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems. In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted disability pensions on the basis of intellectual dysfunction. Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written off sick and 5% even had to take early retirement. In the same study, 34% of 400 questioned physicians reported treating patients with fully impaired earning capacity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Little</b> <b>Wonders</b> were lateral-cut {{single sided}} [...] inch {{gramophone}} records. The records contained only about [...] to 2 minutes of music. The {{small size of}} the discs (together with the cherubic face on later versions of the label) has led some record collectors to incorrectly assume that <b>Little</b> <b>Wonders</b> were made as children's records; they were actually made for the general audience looking for low-priced recordings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Little</b> <b>Wonder's</b> {{whereabouts}} {{after his}} retirement are uncertain. He {{does not appear}} to have had a career at stud. The fifth edition of The General Stud Book reports that he died in 1843. [...] "The Little Known" [...] however, did stand as a stallion and sired some horses, though none of any consequence, between 1846 and 1860.

25|$|In {{keeping with}} his new policy, Churaman {{apparently}} chose to be passive on the Sinsini affair. Similarly {{in the next few}} years, he applied a restraint on his predatory habits, though local malefactors sometimes indulged in plundering on the roads. Mirza Muhammad emphatically adds that henceforward till the defeat of Jahandar Shah (i.e. from September, 1707 to January 1713) he devoted himself to the imperial service and did not permit any obstructions on the road. Early in 1708, he helped the local naib faujdar, Rahim-ul-la Khan, in suppressing the local Afghan rebels. Having attacked the village of Thiravali (5 miles to the east of OL) he accompanied the Khan in an expedition against the Baloch rebels of Shergarh (20 miles to the north of Mathura). They resisted the invaders for three days but ultimately turned their backs, promising to make over a property worth two thousands to the Jat. This further enhanced his image as a powerful chief. <b>Little</b> <b>wonder,</b> therefore, that greater recognition awaited Churaman.|$|E
25|$|High grade coal was {{discovered}} by a hunter on Sharp Mountain in 1791 above the steep sided valleys surrounding Tamaqua, but the news quickly lead to other discoveries such as on at the minor peak called Summit Hill on Pisgah Mountain six miles due east of Tamaqua and as {{much closer to the}} ship-navigable Delaware watershedfrom Summit Hill, the rapids plagued Lehigh River and the higher capacity of boats was but just over a ridge and a half days haul by mules away. Both mineral-finds lead directly to rapid coal mining development of the area, which began first commercially by a joint stock company, the Lehigh Coal Mining Company (LCMC) at Summit Hill in 1792. Shortly after other coal mining ventures also began up the Susquehanna in a third watershed, the Wyoming Valley west of the Poconos and also to west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the Schuylkill Valley as well as closer to Harrisburg down the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Given the fundamental need of fuels, it is <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> the financiers of the day were willing investors ready to back projects which promised to get supplies to new markets. The gorge became historic and not just scenic when such investors came together to continue the English model, canals between major cities of source and supply, if necessary carried across viaducts above streams to provide cheap bulk materials transfers. By the early 1820s, the new management of the Lehigh Coal Mining Company would show the way and the LCMC would disappear as a subsidiary corporation and became a key element in one of the nation's first vertical mergers.|$|E
500|$|Bowie was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996. Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album – <b>Little</b> <b>Wonder</b> and Dead Man Walking – became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song [...] "I'm Afraid of Americans" [...] from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Trent Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100. Bowie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 February 1997. The Earthling Tour took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997. In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC's Children in Need charity single [...] "Perfect Day", which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record [...] "(Safe in This) Sky Life" [...] for The Rugrats Movie. Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as [...] "Safe" [...] on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single [...] "Everyone Says 'Hi'. The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track [...] "Without You I'm Nothing", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.|$|E

So <b>little</b> <b>wonder</b> that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey.

2500|$|Rivers worked {{among the}} Todas {{for less than}} six months during 1901-02, {{communicating}} with his Toda informants only through interpreters and lodged in an Ootacamund hotel. Yet he assembled a stunning collection of data on the ritual and social lives of the Toda people. Almost all who have subsequently studied the Todas have been amazed at the richness and the accuracy of Rivers’s data. His book, [...] "The Todas", which came out in 1906, is still an outstanding contribution to Indian ethnography, “indispensable: still only to be supplemented rather than superseded”, as Murray Emeneau wrote in 1971.

With his renditions of Kodály's big orchestral works, and given his precise yet passionate conducting style, Kertész was particularly well-suited to get the full orchestral swoop and swoon endemic to Psalmus Hungaricus and the Peacock Variations.

2500|$|Stockfish {{is popular}} in West Africa, {{where it is}} used in the many soups that {{complement}} the grain staples fufu and garri.

The Kwe people, who are a fishing people of the English-speaking part of Cameroon, use stockfish in flavoring their palm nut or banga, which can be eaten with a cocoyam pudding called kwacoco.

Andronikos was over [...] tall; his flattering charms stole the hearts of many noble women and with it earned the anger of their menfolk. Exiled by Manuel Komnenos, he returned in 1180 following his death. Despite his senior age of 64 years in 1182, Andronikos retained the good looks of his forties. In August of that year Andronikos sparked a rebellion by marching on to the Capital. The army and the navy did not hesitate to join him and soon rebellion broke out in Constantinople in the name of Andronikos. A massacre of Latins then proceeded, with the women, children and even the sick in the hospitals of the Capital shown no mercy. The trading rights of the Venetians, granted by Alexios almost a century earlier, were also revoked. These actions made the empire powerful enemies in western Europe.
