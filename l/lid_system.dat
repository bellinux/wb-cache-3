40|$|ABSTRACT- Language Identification (LID) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular areas of {{research}} in speech signal processing. Now a day’s lots of approaches have been used to improve performance of <b>LID</b> <b>system</b> which includes Parallel Phone Recognition Language Modeling (PPRLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and general Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) etc. The state-of-art <b>LID</b> <b>system</b> has been utilised lots of feature vectors like LPCC, MFCC, SDC and prosodic. Although fusion of prosodic features with MFCC features shows some improvement in the performance of the <b>LID</b> <b>system.</b> But still it is not sufficient. In this paper, a baseline system for the <b>LID</b> <b>system</b> in multilingual environments has been developed using GMM as a classifier and MFCC combined with Shifted-Delta-Cepstral (SDC) as front end processing feature vectors. In this works, we used the Arunachali Language Speech Database (ALS-DB), a multilingual and multichannel speech corpus which was recently collected from the four local languages namely Adi, Apatani, Galo and Nyishi in Arunachal Pradesh including Hindi and English as secondary languages. The performance of the <b>LID</b> <b>system</b> has been improved by combing MFCC and SDC features than its individual performances. The minimum ERR rates for the features MFCC and SDC individually are 19. 70 % and 11. 83 % respectively while minimum ERR rate for the combined features both MFCC and SDC is 6. 40 %.

This paper investigates a Frequency Modulation (FM) based feature and its contribution to a Language Identification (<b>LID)</b> <b>system,</b> using a Hierarchical LID framework.

In this paper, we extract a FM-based feature using a technique which produces consistent and continuous FM components, and build a <b>LID</b> <b>system</b> on this feature with GMM based modeling.

40|$|Many of the {{language}} identification (<b>LID)</b> <b>systems</b> are based on language models using machine learning (ML) techniques that {{take into account the}} fluctuation of speech over time, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM).

Language specific features are extracted using two different modes: (i) Implicit processing of linear prediction (LP) residual and (ii) Explicit parameterization of linear prediction residual.

40|$|AbstractMost of the Indian {{languages}} are originated from Devanagari, the script of the Sanskrit language. In-spite of similarity in phoneme sets, every language its own {{influence on the}} phonotactic constraints of speech in that language. A modelling technique {{that is capable of}} capturing the slightest variations imparted by the language is a pre-requisite for developing a language identification system (LID). Use of Gaussian mixture modelling technique with a large number of mixture components demands a large training data for each language class, which is hard to collect and handle. In this work, phonotactic variations imparted by the different {{languages are}} modelled using Gaussian mixture modelling with a universal background model (GMM-UBM) technique. In GMM-UBM based modelling certain amount of data from all the language classes is pooled to develop a universal background model (UBM) and the model is adapted to each class. Spectral features (MFCC) are employed to represent the language specific phonotactic information of speech in different languages. During the present study, LID systems are developed using the speech samples from IITKGP-MLILSC.
