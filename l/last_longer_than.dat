In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
5|$|Games <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – {{the average}} NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in {{a football game}} {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Tours are {{the three}} most prestigious multi-week stage races in {{professional}} road bicycle racing. The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España, contested annually in that order. They are the only stage races permitted to <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 14 days. No cyclist has won all three Grand Tours in the same year; the only cyclists to win all three Grand Tours in their career are Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Bernard Hinault, Alberto Contador and Vincenzo Nibali. Contador is the youngest, at 25 years, and quickest to win every Tour, completing the feat in 14 months. It is rare for cyclists to ride all Grand Tours in the same year; in 2004, for example, 474 cyclists started {{in one of the}} Grand Tours, 68 rode two and only two cyclists started all three.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{it was found}} that there was a {{significant}} correlation between the UI and delivery <b>lasting</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 24  h and the logistic regression analysis revealed that delivery <b>lasting</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 24  h was a risk factor for UI. However in a previous study, it was reported that delivery <b>lasting</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 24  h did not have a prominent effect on UI (Thom and Brown 1998). Another study revealed that delivery <b>lasting</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 24  h increased the development rate of moderate or severe urinary incontinence 1.3 times (Rortveit et al. 2003). It was suggested that the pudendal nerve damage after long and difficult delivery and pubococcygeus muscle weakness were possibly the reason for urine leakage. It is thought that the mechanism of the nerve damage during the delivery may be both the stretching of the pelvic floor and direct pressure of the fetal head on the nerve along the pelvic side walls (Thom and Brown 1998).|$|R

25|$|Local club cricket teams, which {{consist of}} amateur players, rarely play matches that <b>last</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> a single day; these may loosely {{be divided into}} {{declaration}} matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually.
