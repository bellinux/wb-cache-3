50|$|Note: At {{some point}} after this, Skutnik changed {{the titles of}} the VODs for Ink Companion parts 1-30 to his new sXXeXX {{numbering}} system. The result of this was {{the separation of the}} two series Ink Companion and <b>Live</b> <b>Streams.</b> Before this point (Ink Compaion 31), the Ink Companion streams still had a secondary numerical designation continuing from <b>Live</b> <b>Stream</b> 50. When Skutnik removed this from the VOD titles, he separated his <b>Live</b> <b>Streams</b> series from his Ink Companion series. Because of this change, the chart directly above now reflects Skutnik's wishes in separating Ink Companion <b>streams</b> from <b>Live</b> <b>Streams,</b> and the new sXXeXX system has replaced the original numbering system.|$|R

5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. <b>Live</b> <b>streaming</b> conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E
