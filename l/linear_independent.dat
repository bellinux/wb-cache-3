50|$|Unlike the 2-sphere, the 3-sphere admits nonvanishing vector fields (sections of its tangent bundle). One {{can even}} find three linearly {{independent}} and nonvanishing vector fields.

Using a simple {{model of the}} processing done by the visual system, three informationally <b>independent</b> <b>linear</b> combinations of the four ERTS bands are mapped onto the three visual colour dimensions of brightness, redness-greenness and blueness-yellowness. The technique permits user-specific transformations which enhance particular features, {{but this is not}} usually needed, since a single transformation provides a picture which conveys much of the information implicit in the ERTS data.

This family of divergences generalizes in some sense the previous weighted divergences studied by Frank et al [5] and Kapur [11]. The weighted (h, phi) -divergence between an empirical distribution and a fixed distribution is here investigated for large simple random samples, and the asymptotic distributions are shown to be either normal or equal to the distribution of a <b>linear</b> combination of <b>independent</b> chi-square variables.

50|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} valence bond methods. Most use n valence bond orbitals for n electrons. If a single set of these orbitals is combined with all <b>linear</b> <b>independent</b> combinations of the spin functions, we have spin-coupled valence bond theory. The total wave function is optimized using the variational method by varying the coefficients of the basis functions in the valence bond orbitals and the coefficients of the different spin functions. In other cases only a sub-set of all possible spin functions is used. Many valence bond methods use several sets of the valence bond orbitals. Be warned that different authors use different names for these different valence bond methods.|$|E

50|$|In {{a recent}} meta-analysis, {{researchers}} found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality (Five factor model) and three streams of emotional intelligence. They examined {{the relative importance of}} these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance. Other studies suggested that GCA and emotional intelligence have a <b>linear</b> <b>independent</b> and complementary contribution to job performance. Côté and Miners (2015) found that these constructs are interrelated when assessing their relationship with two aspects of job performance: organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and task performance. Emotional intelligence is a better predictor of task performance and OCB when GCA is low and vice versa. For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if emotional intelligence is high.|$|E
5000|$|He {{examined}} the properties, individuation and interaction of causets, which each starts from the affirmation that [...] "everything what exists, acts" [...] {{as its first}} element and as its sphere of validity successively produces really news, not predetermined by nor contained in and <b>linear</b> <b>independent</b> from old, and that the earliest elements or occurred facts and their aftereffects appear as its internal logical, geometrical, physical properties (namely, {{the first and the}} next 1,2,4 ... elements of the same rank, represent its dimensions and corresponding primary natural forces). Applied to our real world, this would suggest that successive events, world points, and their actions already would be an own discrete first dimension and producing force, corresponding to proper time (inclusive a discrete variance and limited vality range of facts and their effects), followed by the similar time; a kinematic extension, and two equivalent curvature-defining geometric extensions. This makes plausible that the dimensions of the world increase proportionally to their elementary units, in a not-localizable manner, very classically and approximately corresponding to a radiation with a wavelength of about the world's size, keeping the biggest part of the world's energy, per each elementary space inclusive at any background or surface one such photon or information and a pressure canceling the gravitational deceleration of expansion ...|$|E
