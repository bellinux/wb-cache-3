40|$|Abstract: In the {{foreseeable}} future <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> will be affordable and consequently widely available in work organisations. Several projects have started to investigate what kinds of information are most usefully presented by <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> and in which ways. This {{research is part of}} a larger effort concerning Ambient Displays, but here we focus on the visual presentation of information in work settings. Starting from communication needs in work organisations, we identify Communities of Practice as a relevant organisational group to address, and present a system for supporting them. On the basis of our experience and experience found in the literature we analyse design choices that can alleviate the cost of using these systems.

40|$|Many {{scientists}} {{have demonstrated that}} compared {{to the real world}} egocentric distances in head-mounted display virtual environments are underestimated. However, distance perception in <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> has received less attention. We investigate egocentric distance perception in a virtual office room projected using a semi-spherical, a Max Planck Institute CyberMotion Simulator cabin and a flat <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display.</b> The goal of our research is to systematically investigate distance perception in <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> with commonly used technical specifications. We specifically investigate the role of distance to the target, stereoscopic projection and motion parallax on distance perception. We use verbal reports and blind walking as response measures for the real world experiment. Due to the limited space in the three <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> we use only verbal reports as the response measure for the experiments in the virtual environment. Our results show an overall underestimation of distance perception in the <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays,</b> while verbal estimates of distances are nearly veridical in the real world. We find that even when providing motion parallax and stereoscopic depth cues to the observer in the flat <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display,</b> participants estimate the distances to be smaller than intended. Although stereo cues in the flat <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display</b> do increase distance estimates for the nearest distance, the impact of the stereoscopic depth cues is not enough to result in veridical distance perception. Further, we demonstrate that the distance to the target significantly influences the percent error of verbal estimates in both the real and virtual world. The impact of the distance to the target on the distance judgments is the same in the real world and in two of the used <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays,</b> namely, the MPI CyberMotion Simulator cabin and the flat displays. However, in the semi-spherical display we observe a significantly different influence of distance to the target on verbal estimates of egocentric distances. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for our results. Based on the findings from our research we give general suggestions that could serve as methods for improving the LSIDs in terms of the accuracy of depth perception and suggest methods to compensate for the underestimation of verbal distance estimates in <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays...</b>|$|R

Our work investigates whether distances are still compressed in a <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> immersive virtual environment, where participants are able to see their own body surrounded by the virtual environment. We conducted our experiment in both the real world using a real room and the <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> immersive virtual environment using a 3 D model of the real room. Our results showed a significant underestimation of verbal reports of egocentric distances in the <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> immersive virtual environment, while the distance judgments {{of the real world}} were closer to veridical. Moreover, we observed a significant effect of distances in both environments. In the real world closer distances were slightly underestimated, while further distances were slightly overestimated. In contrast to the real world in the virtual environment participants overestimated closer distanc es (up to 2. 5 m) and underestimated distances that were further than 3 m. A possible reason for this effect of distances in the virtual environment may be that participants perceived stereo cues differently when the target was projected on the floor versus {{on the front of the}} large screen...|$|E

40|$|Traditional desktop {{workstations}} {{are inherently}} limited {{in the amount}} of information displayed and the interaction techniques afforded due to their small size. Large screen displays with high resolution provide the screen real estate to solve these problems, but simply increasing the size of a display can create new problems if the interaction methods do not scale appropriately. We propose to investigate new interaction methods to control the large amount of information present in a high resolution <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display.</b> Additionally we seek to identify and exploit new interaction techniques, such as multiple user interactions, that become possible with these displays. We will provide a lab space open to all interested researchers, and assemble and setup a high resolution <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display.</b> Additional hardware for interaction such as tablet PCs, PDAs, laser pointers, and head trackers will be provided. Novel interactions will be developed and evaluated against each other and existing technologies.

By the end of summer, a full understand of existing techniques and a plan for a masters thesis will be complete. 2. Overview Large screen displays are often interacted with in a manner that mirrors the desktop usage. Quite often the input is done through some sort of touch screen device, which is a significant improvement over the mouse for these displays.

Overall, in the virtual world we found an underestimation of distances by 17 as compared to near accurate performance in the real world. Moreover, in the virtual world there was an effect of distance, which indicated overestimation for distances that occurred before the screen (3. 5 meters), while for distances past the physical screen there was underestimation. To determine th e full reason for these effects further analysis is needed.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of the current project {{was to examine the}} effect of different viewing environments on individual's use of spatial frames of references while performing mental rotation task. Twenty five participants were administered a computerized mental rotation task presented in three different viewing environments: two-dimensional computer desktop (2 D), three-dimensional <b>large</b> projector <b>screen</b> (3 DP), and three-dimensional <b>large</b> projector <b>screen</b> with tracking (3 DPT). The participants’ responses were compared to those obtained in fully-immersive virtual environment (VE) offered through the use of head-mounted displays. In 2 D condition, the participants encoded the stimuli allocentrically, in relation to a computer screen. This is in contrast to a fully immersive VE, where participants encoded the images egocentrically, in relation to a viewer-centered frame of reference. In 3 DP and 3 DPT conditions, the participants tended to rely more on egocentric rather than allocentric encoding, although not to the same extent as in fully-immersive VEs. The change in participants’ responses in 3 DP and 3 DPTconditions, as compared to 2 D condition, implies that <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> provide higher degree of immersivity than conventional 2 D displays. However, in contrast to fully immersive VEs, <b>large</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> are insufficient to ensure the dominant use of a viewer-centered frame of reference...|$|R
