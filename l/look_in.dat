5|$|Claire {{appeared}} in George A. Romero's Japanese TV commercial for Resident Evil 2 {{and in a}} viral marketing video to promote Resident Evil 5 (despite her not appearing in actual game). Several action figures of Claire were released by various manufacturers, including one by Toy Biz in 1998, {{as well as two}} by Moby Dick Toys, two by Palisades Toys, and one by Volks in 2001. A Claire block-style figure was also released by Dragon in the Kubrick's Resident Evil line, while Vanilla Chop produced a resin kit. One of costumes for the character C. Viper in the fighting game Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was inspired by Claire's iconic <b>look</b> <b>in</b> Resident Evil 2.|$|E

5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new <b>look</b> <b>in</b> {{attempt to get}} the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.|$|E
5|$|Korn made a demo tape, Neidermayer's Mind, in 1993, {{which was}} {{distributed}} free to record companies and on request {{to members of}} the public.

The band experienced mainstream success with Follow the Leader (1998) and Issues (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's mainstream success continued with Untouchables (2002), Take a <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror (2003) and See You on the Other Side (2005).|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|Samantha {{revealed}} that she too {{would be seen}} in a dual role— a mature mother named Krishna Veni in the past and a bubbly girl named Priya in the present. She added that she would not be overshadowed in the film despite the presence of three male leads. Similar to Ye Maaya Chesave, Chaitanya and Samantha had a kissing scene in this film {{as a part of the}} script. A clip of one of Samantha's looks in the film was leaked in late July 2013. She was seen sporting an urban look and opted for a complete makeover. Nagarjuna's <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the film was leaked in mid August 2013 and he was seen sporting corrective eyeglasses and a conventional clean shave and moustache for which he removed the goatee he grew for his previous works Greeku Veerudu (2013) and Bhai (2013).

5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on April 3, 2008, at the Sunbeam Studios in London, co-directed by fashion {{photographer}} Tom Munro and Nathan Rissman. The video was shot during Madonna's photo shoot with Elle magazine, for its May cover girl issue. Madonna's retro-chic <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the video {{was inspired by}} the photoshoot. The video featured a guest appearance from rapper Pharrell Williams; he was portrayed alongside Madonna, singing to the camera in front of various backdrops. Madonna wore thigh-high PVC boots, visible underwear and sheer tops in the video. The dresses were designed by several fashion brands, including Chanel and Roberto Cavalli.|$|E

He was astonished at {{the strength of the}} woman and scandalised by her proceedings. But he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street. He was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour. Moreover, this or never was the time to humour the woman. Comrade Ossipon avoided easily the end of the counter, and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour.

5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this <b>look</b> <b>in</b> order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|For the live-action {{portion of}} the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the {{rotoscope}} models acted out their parts in costume. During {{the middle of a}} large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional <b>look.</b> <b>In</b> a few shots the two techniques are combined.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and <b>look</b> <b>in</b> opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{played the}} role of Shankar, an {{encounter}} specialist similar to the one he played in Dookudu. This was the third time Mahesh {{played the role}} of a police officer in his career. Tamannaah was signed as the female lead and she {{played the role of}} a local sweet shop owner. She sported a traditional attire for her <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the film. Rajendra Prasad was chosen to play Mahesh's father in the film. Prakash Raj was selected to play a negative role in the film. He was later replaced with Sonu Sood due to his creative differences with Vaitla. Brahmaji played the role of an honest police constable. Shruti Haasan performed an item number in the film which was the first of her other similar special appearances. Brahmanandam was signed to play a supporting role. He performed a spoof of Racha (2011), Legend (2014) and Race Gurram (2014). Mahesh performed a spoof on the game show Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to <b>look</b> <b>in,</b> but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E

5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would <b>look</b> <b>in</b> keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
5|$|The planet Vulcan {{setting was}} created using {{a mixture of}} on-location {{photography}} at Minerva Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park and set recreation. Yellowstone was selected after filming in Turkish ruins proved to be too expensive. Securing permission for filming the scenes was difficult {{in the middle of}} the summer tourist season, but the Parks Department acquiesced so long as the crew remained on the boardwalks to prevent damage to geological formations. Zuberano, who had helped select the site for the shoot, traveled to Yellowstone and returned with a number of photos. Minor also made a trip and returned to create a large painting depicting how the scene might <b>look.</b> <b>In</b> consultations with Michelson, the crew decided to use miniatures in the foreground to create the Vulcan temples, combined with the real hot springs in the background. In the film, the bottom third of the frames were composed of miniature stairs, rocks, bits of red glass and a Vulcan statue. The center of the frame contained Nimoy's shots and the park setting, while the final third of the frame was filled with a matte painting. On August 8, the day after production began at Paramount, an eleven-person second unit left for Yellowstone. The sequence took three days to shoot.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They <b>look</b> <b>in</b> Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her {{that there are many}} people who would want to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E
