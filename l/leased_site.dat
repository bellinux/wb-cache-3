The [...] "Mauermuseum - Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie" [...] was opened on June 14,1963, in the immediate vicinity of the Berlin Wall. It shows photographs and fragments of the separation of Germany.

2500|$|The second {{school had}} been {{established}} on a <b>leased</b> <b>site</b> near Bankstown Airport and had attracted approximately 720 students. This site was shortly after found to be contaminated and the school was forced {{to contribute to the}} cost of a clean-up. It was soon after discovered that the Federal Airports Corporation, who had leased the land to Noor Al Houda, knew previously of the contamination. Ihram decided to fight against Bankstown Airport to save Noor Al Houda, resulting in a five-year-long Supreme court battle involving 125 court appearances. She re-mortgaged and later sold her home, and accessed her superannuation to cover part of the $2million in legal expenses. The school was eventually awarded $1,094,430 in damages by Justice Clifton Hoeben, finding the Federal Airports Corporation, and subsequently the Bankstown Airport Ltd, owed the school a duty of care to disclose a report that the land was contaminated with sewage waste.

2500|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] stationary blast furnace and four [...] rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second open hearth furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace at the <b>leased</b> <b>site</b> a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied [...] of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|The {{northern}} Great Plains of Saskatchewan {{is one of}} {{the most}} significantly modified landscapes in Canada. While the majority of anthropogenic disturbance to Saskatchewan’s grasslands is the result of agricultural practices, oil and gas activity are of increasing concern to grassland conservation efforts. Although such developments require formal regulatory approval (Environmental Impact Assessment), follow-up and monitoring of the effects of oil and gas development on grasslands is not common practice. In the absence of empirical based follow-up and monitoring, the actual environmental effects of petroleum and natural gas (PNG) development on grassland ecology and the spatial extent of development are largely unknown. This thesis examines the spatial and temporal extent of PNG development and its effects on grassland ecology within a PFRA (Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration) pasture in southwest Saskatchewan. The extent of the changes to infrastructure and the actual impacts from development within the study area were documented from 1955 to 2006. The actual impacts of oil and gas activity on grassland ecology were determined by analyzing ground cover characteristics, soil properties, and community composition at <b>lease</b> <b>sites</b> and compared to reference pasture sites. Associated with construction practices, <b>lease</b> <b>sites</b> had low herbaceous, Lycopodiaceae, litter, organic horizon (Ah) thickness, and soil compaction values. <b>Lease</b> <b>sites</b> were also found to have low desirable species diversity, range health values, and greater undesirable species presence. Impacts from development were amplified at active, highly productive <b>lease</b> <b>sites.</b> The impacts associated with PNG development were also found to persist for more than 50 years, and extend 20 m – 25 m beyond the physical footprint of infrastructure. This research will contribute to monitoring and mitigation measures for oil and gas development within Saskatchewan and Canadian grasslands...|$|R

5000|$|North Cape Yacht Club {{was founded}} in 1962 after {{several members of the}} Toledo Yacht Club, {{frustrated}} because of the too long trek from Maumee Bay to the racing venue for their Dragons in the open waters of Lake Erie, found a new location where the Dragon fleet could be moored closer to deep-water sailing. The new site was a lakefront property near the mouth of South Otter Creek that was then a duck marsh and the remnants of the old Toledo Beach Amusement Park. The initial lease was signed December 14, 1961, and the club formed. In 1971, the club purchased the previously <b>leased</b> <b>site</b> for $125,000 with the proceeds of bonds sold to its members.

5000|$|After Joseph Terry died in 1850 {{the company}} was in the control of solicitors and executors until 1854 when it was handed over to his sons Joseph Jnr, Robert, and John. Joseph quickly {{expanded}} the business; four years later he moved production to a <b>leased</b> <b>site</b> at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse. This allowed easy shipment of raw products into the new production facility from the Humber estuary; twice weekly a steam ship brought ingredients, including sugar and cocoa, as well as coal to power the new steam-powered machinery.

He renamed the business Joseph Terry & Sons and it became a limited liability company in 1895.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the cause of high mortality of the pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, in the north-west of Western Australia was carried out over a 3 -year period. Pathological and microbiological investigations revealed {{that the majority of}} diseased oysters were infected with marine Vibrio bacteria. One common isolate, Vibrio harveyi, was shown experimentally to induce disease similar to that seen in the field. Pearl oyster mortality during pearling industry operations occurred following transportation of oysters in tanks on carrier boats from collection grounds to oyster <b>lease</b> <b>sites.</b> The number of marine Vibrios in the water of carrier tanks increased rapidly during transportation because of inadequate water circulation and this was believed to be the time when infection occurred. Mortalities were greatest at times when water temperatures were lowest and experiments showed that oysters were most susceptible to disease at these low temperatures. It is postulated that oysters, weakened by exposure to low ambient temperature, come into contact with high concentrations of bacteria during transportation to <b>lease</b> <b>sites</b> at which time bacterial invasion occurs...|$|R
