5|$|According to Russian , state {{symbols and}} signs are not {{protected}} by copyright. As such, the anthem's music and lyrics {{may be used}} and modified freely. Although the law calls for the anthem to be performed respectfully and for performers to avoid causing offence, it does not define what constitutes offensive acts or penalties. Standing for the anthem is required by law but the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> specify a penalty for refusing to stand.|$|E

A U.S. plaintiffs' law firm, Kreindler & Kreindler, signed up families of about 80 of the crash victims as clients; and filed a lawsuit on their behalf on 13 April 2016 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the Arizona-based Lufthansa Airline Training Center that Lubitz had attended for his training as a commercial pilot.|$|E

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated {{is that of a}} minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{require that}} arrested people be {{immediately}} charged with an offence, and by 22 April 2005 no charges had yet been laid. Police {{indicated that the}} five arrested at the airport would be charged with drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and offered them A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of Jordan grants its monarch {{the right to}} withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent {{to him from the}} National Assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly). If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him, it becomes law without his signature.|$|E

The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast {{introduced}} its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game) who previously produced materials in support of the D product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer & Company, are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl.

The Lebanese <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} local self-governance, which Article12 of the Constitution of Russia guarantees, is {{implemented}} on the republic's territory {{in accordance with}} the provisions of Federal Law No.131-FZ On the General Principles of the Organization of the Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation. While the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require any connection between the system of the administrative-territorial divisions of a federal subject and its municipal structure, Adygea's administrative districts are nevertheless incorporated as the municipal districts and the republican urban okrugs are incorporated as the municipal urban okrugs. On the lower level, the municipal districts are divided into municipal urban settlements, which combine an urban-type settlement and adjacent rural localities, and municipal rural settlements, which combine several neighboring rural localities.|$|E
5|$|There are 53 {{municipalities}} of Finland in which Finnish {{is not the}} sole official language. In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, {{it is possible for}} the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, Turku. On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Lebanon's Identity Card is {{the main}} form of {{identification}} on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Lebanon. All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of these documents, the <b>law</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> state that one is obliged to submit the document at that very moment.|$|E
