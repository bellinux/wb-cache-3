30|$|In Kamen-Wasserkurl, in {{the state}} of North Rhine-Westphalia, a {{borehole}} was drilled for geothermal energy supply of a detached home in 2009. When drillings reached a depth of 70  m, the drilling team stopped the work in the late afternoon. Later on the same day, a sinkhole formed around the drilling site. The sinkhole had a volume of 50 – 60  m 3 and buried the entire drilling equipment. On the following days, a land subsidence of up to 10  cm was measured up to a distance of 200  m from the drilling site. Cracks started to appear in adjacent buildings. Twenty neighbouring houses were damaged and four of them finally had to be demolished (AD-HOC-AG Geologie 2011). With a final depth of 70  m, drillings had reached the transitional zone between the Emscher formation and the karstified Plänerkalk group (Fig.  4). The Emscher formation and particularly the Plänerkalk group are characterised by water-conducting faults that are interconnected with the karst system of the Plänerkalk group (AD-HOC-AG Geologie 2011). Low volumes of cuttings indicated a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> during the drilling process already. The cuttings were flushed into the karst system by the drilling fluid. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> went unnoticed at the surface: groundwater flow from the quaternary aquifer into the borehole compensated the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> Groundwater flow was facilitated by the absence of an annulus casing. When the drilling team pulled out the pipes in the evening, groundwater flow was reinforced. With increasing flow velocities, large amounts of sediment were eroded and transported into the karst formation. A sinkhole formed around the uncased annulus. At a certain point, the material loss was balanced by a lateral mass transfer from the quaternary aquifer. This subrosion process led to subsidence in the surrounding area. The borehole was grouted with 750  m 3 of cement in the following 3  months. The hydraulic sealing of the quaternary aquifer and the karst formation could be restored. The total amount of damage is presently estimated to be more than one million Euros (WN 2009).|$|E

The Lost Circulation Technology Development Program is sponsored at Sandia National Laboratories by the U. S. Department of Energy.

50|$|Water-based {{drilling}} mud most commonly consists of bentonite clay (gel) with additives such as barium sulfate (barite), calcium carbonate (chalk) or hematite. Various thickeners {{are used to}} influence the viscosity of the fluid, e.g. xanthan gum, guar gum, glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyanionic cellulose (PAC), or starch. In turn, deflocculants are used to reduce viscosity of clay-based muds; anionic polyelectrolytes (e.g. acrylates, polyphosphates, lignosulfonates (Lig) or tannic acid derivates such as Quebracho) are frequently used. Red mud was the name for a Quebracho-based mixture, named after {{the color of the}} red tannic acid salts; it was commonly used in the 1940s to 1950s, then was made obsolete when lignosulfonates became available. Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> into permeable formations). A weighting agent such as barite is added to increase the overall density <b>of</b> the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids.|$|R
30|$|Filtration rate {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of drilling fluids. High rates of filtration increase the mud thickness, which lead to operational problems such as stuck pipe (Nasiri et al. 2018). After hot rolling of drilling fluids for 16  h, API filtration test was conducted. According to Fig.  6, the amount of fluid loss of the base mud is equal to 2.7 ccs at 325  °F. However, fluid <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> rises up to 28 ccs at 350  °F. When 1 (v/v %) of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine is used in heavy weight drilling fluid, fluid loss is in acceptable range up to 350  °F. However, above 350  °F, fluid loss dramatically increases. When 2, 4, and 6 (v/v %) of the amine were used, fluid loss is controlled up to 375  °F.|$|E

Good temperature resistance and salt tolerance of “–SO 3 -” of AMPS, strong absorption ability of “amino-group” of AM, and good hydrability of side chain polyoxyethylene ether (C 2 H 4 O) n of APEG provide SJ- 1 excellent properties as a fluid loss additive.

These are of 60 / 40, 70 / 30, 80 / 20 and 90 / 10 oil-water ratio. The characterization part deals with rheology measurement and modelling at various temperatures, and is based on direct experimental measurements. The performance simulation study deals with the hole cleaning efficiency of the drilling fluids. The lost circulation part deals with the bridging performance of the drilling fluids at various simulated fracture widths. For the experiment, 13. 82 lb/bbl LC-lube (graphite) was used as lost circulation material. The results show that particle size distribution with a D 50 at or higher than the fracture width gives a better performance in terms of bridge strength.

The chemicals are entered into the North Sea environment attached to bore hole cuttings, which are deposited on the seabed {{not far from the}} discharge sites. After deposition, erosion may occur by biodegradation, bioturbation, resuspension and release to the watermass of dissolved chemicals or metabolites. In the present investigation, aliquots of control sediment and three types of cuttings were deposited in duplicate benthic chambers. During an experimental period of 161 days, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> from the sediments as well as the change of the ratio between <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> and barium was measured. The mineralisation <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> carbon to CO 2 and water was calculated from oxygen consumption measurements and effects on sediment pH and redox potentials were determined at various time intervals. The results showed that Novasol II polyalfaolefins and Aquamul ethers degraded more slowly than Petrofree esters. However, as shown by strong redox potential deviations, the availability of the esters to sulphate reducing bacteria will most likely reduce the diversity of benthic communities during the degradation period.

40|$|Drilling teams face several {{challenges}} when {{operating in}} high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) fields, such as lost circulation and difficulties in well control.

40|$|In deep {{drilling}} operation, borehole collapse due to insufficient drilling fluid pressure and borehole fracturing {{as a result}} of excessive drilling fluid pressure are two major modes of borehole failure. The latter may result in severe <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> into the formation, resulting in potential well control issues with influx of high pressure fluid or gas from adjacent formation layers. To prevent drilling fluid loss, the fluid pressure must not exceed an upper limit, otherwise the borehole will fail in tension or fracture. However, if the fluid pressure is too low, the borehole may collapse or fail in compression. Drilling fluid pressure window is therefore typically set by the upper limit of tensile failure and the lower limit of compressive failure. If the stress state and rock strength require a lower limit which is close to the upper limit, then the drilling fluid pressure design needs to stay within a very narrow window and consequently the feasibility of drilling may be questioned. Based on rigorous mechanics principles, this paper shows {{that it is possible to}} experience shear failure due to increasing drilling fluid pressure even before it reaches the upper limit of tensile failure. This may mean a more restricting drilling fluid pressure window in drilling weaker rocks. Implications of near wellbore shear failure are also briefly discussed in the context of water injection design which relies on injection at high pressure...|$|E

40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{is one of}} {{the drilling}} operational problems. It refers to the total or partial <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> into highly permeable zones or natural or induced fractures. This problem is likely to occur when the hydrostatic head pressure of drilling fluid in the hole exceeds the formation pressure. Today, managing lost circulation remains a significant challenge to oilwell drilling operations because it may contribute to high non-productive time. It is imperative to note that the overbalance pressure situation also can cause the invasion of mud filtrate into production zones which will result in formation damage. To address these problems, an experimental investigation has been done on durian rind as an alternative fluid loss and lost circulation materials in water-based mud. Durian rind was selected as a mud loss control material because it contains close to 20 % pectin which may complement the formation of high quality mat-like bridges across openings of the formation. The test involved the use of standard mud testing equipment and a lost circulation test cell. Durian rind powder was prepared by cleaning and cutting the durian rind into small pieces of 1 to 2 cm, and then dried them in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours before grinding into five different sizes from coarse to ultra-fine while Hydro-plug, the commercial lost circulation material was supplied by Scomi Energy. The fluid loss test was conducted using a standard low pressure filter press while the bridging test was carried out at 100 psi of pressure difference and ambient temperature using a lost circulation cell. Fine durian in the water-based mud gave the best fluid loss control compared to coarse durian rind, fine and coarse Hydro-plug.

After only 6 days of heating, the measured bottom hole temperature was 426  °C, and the fluid pressure was 34  MPa. The southern tip of the Reykjanes peninsula is the landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. Reykjanes is unique among Icelandic geothermal systems in that it is recharged by seawater, which has a critical point of 406  °C at 29. 8  MPa. The geologic setting and fluid characteristics at Reykjanes provide a geochemical analog that allows us to investigate the roots of a mid-ocean ridge submarine black smoker hydrothermal system.

30|$|It is {{expected}} that the global oil demand increase {{in the coming years}} will be due to a leap in energy demand (Pourafshary and Azimpour et al. 2009; Kong and Ohadi 2010). As most of the oil wells around the world are at their maturity phases (Hite et al. 2004), the drilling stage is now even of more importance than before to minimize oil waste. As drilling fluid is, however, the most important element in a drilling process advanced well control methods focus on controlling the properties of the drilling fluid which is an advantage over conventional drilling methods. An efficient drilling operation depends mostly on the rheological properties of the drilling fluids (i.e., mud density, plastic viscosity, yield point, gel strength, and filtration loss) to ensure wellbore stability (Sadegh Hassani and Amrollahi et al. 2016; Sami 2016; Aftab and; Ismail et al. 2017). The widespread applications of nanotechnology in the energy sector have been widely extended to {{the oil and gas industry}} for various purposes including drilling in the recent years (Sabet and Hosseini et al. 2016). Nanotechnology is a branch of science which deals with the manipulation of atoms and molecules in a nano scale to produce macro scale matter with unique properties (Serrano and Rus et al. 2009). Some experts have introduced nano-drilling fluids with advanced features as the next generation of drilling fluids that will transform the drilling industry (Evdokimov and Eliseev et al. 2006; Amanullah and Al-Tahini 2009; Rao 2010; Li and; Xu et al. 2012; William and; Ponmani et al. 2014; Al-Yasiri and Al-Sallami 2015). Using nanoparticle drilling fluids, features including friction and wear reduction factor and rheology properties can be altered (Jahns 2014). Some of the advantages of nano-based drilling fluids are improving the efficiency of shale stabilization, enhancing mud cake, improving cement, and enhancing anti-corrosion capacity (Amanullah and Al-Tahini 2009; Kong and Ohadi 2010). Drilling fluid is expensive any loss will increase the corresponding costs, also the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> in the formation lowers well productivity as skin factor increases (Pourafshary and Azimpour et al. 2009).

With these samples and {{within the context of the}} Marsdiep project it is investigated if Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) can be used as a Site Investigation (SI) technique. In the Marsdiep project the feasibility of a pipeline constructed using HDD between the island Texel and Den Helder is investigated. Marsdiep is the name of the water and tidal gully between Texel and Den Helder. Regular SI techniques are not feasible, due to among others; the length of 4. 5 km, the depth that is required for a HDD of this length and the tidal gully. The geology of the area is unknown so SI is required. For this purpose pilot drillings, the first part of a regular HDD project, are made at NAP- 65 m and NAP- 85 m from both Texel and Den Helder. These pilot drillings are adapted so that additional data are acquired. The rheologic properties are determined for samples taken from the return flow and the formation of the samples is determined after sieving. A range of possible source locations of the samples are calculated, using different scenarios based on the uncertainty with regards to the borehole diameter and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> The results of the scenarios are compared to the results of the initial SIs, which consists of a seismic survey, onshore, vertical drillings and Cone Penetration Tests (CPTs).

A geological cross-section is constructed based on the results of scenario 5 and initial SIs. In addition to the geology the suitability of HDD as a SI technique is investigated. It is found that with minor adaptations to a regular HDD it can be used in combination with other techniques to determine the geology of an area. The other SIs are required to compare the results to and to determine the best scenario.

40|$|Pre-drill pore {{pressure}} and fracture gradient predictions {{are important for}} successful drilling and well construction. There are numerous different methods for calculating the {{pore pressure}} in shales without direct measurements in the wellbore. All of the methods are based on interpretation of geophysical data, such as acoustic velocity and/or formation resistivity, which {{are sensitive to the}} effective stresses in the formation. Standard methods (like Bower’s or Eaton’s) utilize overburden effective stress for pore pressure prediction. Those methods are developed for regions with normal faulting stress regimes, where the direction of maximum compression is vertical and magnitude is equal to the weight of overburden. Due to the fluid-like behavior of salt on a geologic time scale, in situ stresses around salt structures may deviate significantly from regional tectonic directions, which in turn may significantly affect wellbore stability. The main goal {{of this study is to}} quantify the difference in pore pressure and overburden stress predictions in a salt-related basin calculated with different methods, such as: a standard density integration and finite element modeling (FEM) using Plaxis software. The input geometry for geomechanical modeling was based on EDGE 2004 synthetic velocity model. The input geomechanical parameters were calculated from seismic interval velocity using empirical correlations developed for Gulf of Mexico. In this study, it is demonstrated that a standard overburden calculation methods (based on density integration) can lead to errors in pore pressure prediction with magnitude up to 30 MPa; while 2 D FEM is able to capture stress perturbation around salt structures.

40|$|Wellbore breathing, {{also known}} as ballooning, {{observed}} while drilling has often been mistakenly interpreted as an influx of formation <b>fluid</b> or the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> This misinterpretation leads to costly well control procedures that may make the situation even worse. Wellbore breathing effects are significant in High Temperature High Pressure (HTHP) wells {{because of the high}} mud pressure required to control the well, and the small drilling pressure window gives small room for error. In order to avoid a dangerous well control situation, it will be crucial to be able to diagnose the breathing event as quickly as possible. There are a number of ways to identify a breathing well, using information gathered on the surface or by downhole logging tools. By reading the flow “signature” of the well during pump stops and interpret its signals, it is possible to make the correct action and thus prevent hazardous situations. It is important to get a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and factors controlling the breathing phenomenon {{in order to be able}} to distinguish it from a real well control situation. The main mechanisms of wellbore breathing are usually quoted: 1. Expansion and reduction <b>of</b> the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> due to compressibility effects. This is usually the most significant breathing effect. 2. Elastic deformation on the borehole wall. This usually gives minor losses; the effect depends on the elastic properties of the formation. 3.

Mud flow into natural fractures which can give large breathing effects in natural fractured reservoirs. A numerical model was built, in order to analyze a mud loss / mud gain event into a natural fracture. The model showed that:. Increasing the length of the fracture will give a longer lasting mud gain / mud loss event, and the cumulative loss will also increase significantly..

(2017) laid a good foundation for rheological models for nano-drilling fluids, Furthermore, extending the work to cover other aspects <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> mud performance such as fluid loss behavior is important. There is currently no known model which describes the fluid <b>loss</b> behavior <b>of</b> nano-drilling muds. The development of models for describing the <b>fluid</b> behavior <b>of</b> nanoparticle-enhanced <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> is critical towards successful modelling, design and cost-effective drilling operations. The well-known API fluid loss model is simply a function of time and parametrized approach is taken when describing the <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticle-enhanced <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> The contributory effect of nanoparticles in the fluid loss reduction is not captured in the model.|$|R
40|$|When a well is {{drilled in}} a {{hydrocarbon}} reservoir, the thermodynamic equilibrium of virgin rocks is altered, the natural stresses are redistributed, and a stress concentration occurs around the hole. The alteration of original equilibrium {{can lead to}} wellbore yield, evidenced as shear banding and dilatation, circumferential crack, and microfissuring process. Borehole instability represents the main cause for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> and consequent potential kick problems, and can be so severe to determine the wellbore abandonment. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> time associated with stability problems is estimated to account for between 12 and 15 % <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> cost world-wide. Physical and mechanical processes occurring within and around the borehole because <b>of</b> interaction between <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> and rocks can degrade {{the stability of the}} wellbore especially in shale intervals, which can make up over 75 % <b>of</b> <b>drilled</b> formations. In fact, due to their fine-grained nature and low permeability, in association with high porosity and high fluid saturation, shale minerals are particularly sensitive to time-dependent stability degrade. In order to accurately analyse the complex behaviour of shale minerals, the effects of mechanical deformation, hydraulic diffusion and temperature gradient, as well as their combination must be taken into account. The classic poro-elastic theory, which allows consideration of the coupled phenomena of time-dependent pore fluid diffusion and formation stress variation, fails to capture the effects of temperature gradient and plastic deformation, particularly remarkable in the shale behaviour analysis. So a thermo-poro-mechanical approach, coupling constitutive equations with thermal and hydraulic laws, is necessary to perform accurate time-dependent analyses of stress, pore pressure and temperature distribution around the wellbore in shale formations. This paper presents the analytic formulation of a thermo-poro-mechanical model, in which the basic Desai's model is used to describe the rock plastic behaviour for a mono-dimensional, axisymmetric problem in plane state of strain. With the aid of an in-house software, the proposed model was first validated, also by comparison with the output of a well-known geomechanical numerical simulator available on the market, and then applied to several real and synthetic cases. Based on the results of one of the examined case history, the paper shows how the borehole stability modelling approach is fundamental to systematically take into consideration the stress variations around the hole and the associated rock deformation and pore pressure changes during <b>drilling.</b> The prediction <b>of</b> natural equilibrium time-dependent alterations allows drilling engineers to improve the design phase, to take decisions on critical effects potentially occurring during drilling as well as to optimize completion (e. g. casing placement and/or cementing) of a well...|$|R

3000|$|Ensuring {{that the}} {{rheological}} properties <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are controlled and monitored remains {{an important aspect}} <b>of</b> successful <b>drilling</b> operations. Pressure loss prediction, for example, is mainly {{a function of the}} precise knowledge of the rheology <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> The rheological profile <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> undergoes substantial changes when it flows into a wellbore. The complex nature of characterizing and predicting the rheological profile <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> is {{as a result of a}} combination of factors such as pressure, shear history, temperature and time (Abdo and Danish Haneef 2012; Ismail et al. 2016 a, b; Vryzas et al. 2016). Precise estimation of the rheology <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> requires a good understanding of its properties and the impact of the associated microstructure on the flow behavior (Vryzas et al. 2015; Sehly et al. 2015). The <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> property <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> is another important property, which must be controlled for a cost-effective drilling campaign. This is seen as the second most important property after <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> rheology. <b>Drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> invasion into bare formations represents one of the key causes of formation damage. Such event may lead to expensive well stimulation activities and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> production. The issue of fluid invasion into the exposed formation is known as a major factor responsible for the irregular decline in the productivity of most reservoirs (Aftab et al. 2016). The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fluids into bare formations takes place because of the pressure difference between the wellbore and the reservoir. This has necessitated the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> wells to be done as overbalanced, i.e., wellbore pressures being greater than the formation pressure. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fluids into formations is accompanied by the deposition of solids from the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> on the face of the formation. The build-up of solids over time leads to the formation of a filter cake on the face of the formation. The filter cake is often impermeable and can help prevent excessive formation damage (Contreras et al. 2014). Various nanoparticles have been reported for use in rheology and <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> Amanullah et al. (2011) reported test results on the formulation and application of three categories of nano-drilling <b>fluids.</b> The nano-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> were homogenous and stable. The stability of the nanoparticles was ensured by the use of surfactants and polymers. The results from the test carried out on the nano-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> showed that the fluid rheology was improved with high- and low-end rheological properties. Fluid loss was substantially reduced due to the formation of low permeable thin filter cake. With the reported results, the use of nanoparticles can be a good fluid loss additive and can reduce the incidence of differential pipe sticking in formations being drilled. Barry et al. (2015) evaluated the rheology and fluid <b>loss</b> behavior <b>of</b> bentonite suspensions using three nano-based additives; iron oxide nanoparticles, bentonite clay intercalated with iron oxide nanoparticles and alumina-silicate clay hybrid nanoparticles under high and low pressure and temperature conditions. Low conditions were set at 25  °C and 6.9 Bar while high conditions were set at 200  °C and 70 Bar. The rheology and fluid loss behavior were affected by high conditions for temperature although the effect of pressure was insignificant compared to that of temperature. The shear stress values obtained for bentonite suspensions containing iron oxide nanoparticles and nanoparticle-intercalated clay were high at various shear rate compared to the base case suspension. The alumina-silicate hybrid gave low values for shear stress at varying shear rates when compared to the base case suspension.

In this study, the impact of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and nano metal oxides (titanium oxide, aluminum oxide and copper oxide) on the rheological properties <b>of</b> water based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> were investigated.

40|$|In Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) method, it is {{difficult}} to predict the equivalent circulation density due to co-existence of three phases which are air, cuttings and <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> This study presents the application of a developed model inspired from a novel intelligent algorithm namely radial basis function optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-RBF) algorithm to calculate frictional pressure <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> two-phase gasified <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> flow along with cutting as the third phase in inclined wellbore portions.

30|$|Drilling {{operation}} {{for the second}} IDDP well started {{in the beginning of}} August 2016 with deepening of an existing 2500  m deep production RN- 15 well located in the Reykjanes geothermal field in south–west Iceland. The RN- 15 was a mere vertical production well with a 13 3 / 8 ″ production casing string cemented down to 794  m and an open hole completion. <b>Drilling</b> <b>of</b> the IDDP- 2 well was carried out ‘blind’, i.e., without any <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> returns with an exception of an interval of around 180  m after completed primary cementing operation of an anchor casing at 2941  m depth. <b>Losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> could not be cured with loss circulation material (i.e., polymer pills) nor with multiple cement plugs performed through drill bit as well as through drillable fiber cementing strings. Multiple challenges occurred during drilling operations including weather delays, problems with hole instability that required multiple reaming jobs as well as stuck pipe incidents. The IDDP- 2 well was cemented using reverse circulation method, due to total fluid losses and achieved satisfactory results. As of today, the IDDP- 2 well has the deepest cemented casing in any geothermal well in Iceland. 13 core runs were attempted with rather poor core recovery using an impregnated 8 ½″ diamond core bit and perfect core recovery of nearly 100 % with a 6 ″ PDC core bit beneath the liner pipe. Poor core recovery in the IDDP- 2 well might be explained by fill-in {{at the bottom of the}} well, inclination, heavy dog legs, thermal fracturing of the rock formations as well as the diameter of core barrel being wider than the diameter <b>of</b> heavyweight <b>drill</b> pipe. The IDDP- 2 well was finished at a depth of 4659  m in mid-December 2016 and the perforated liner pipe was lowered to a well depth of 4572  m. At the end <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> operations, an additional sacrificial 7 ″ casing was set to a depth of 1300  m and cemented. Logging program, including temperature, pressure, and injectivity measurements, was carried out after 6  days of partial heating up. It was confirmed that the IDDP- 2 well successfully penetrated the supercritical conditions of the geothermal brines in the Reykjanes geothermal system with 427  °C and 340 bars of pressure. The main feed zones of the IDDP- 2 well were estimated at depths of 3360  m, 4200  m, 4370  m and 4550  m (Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017). Right after the drilling operation ceased, an 3 ½″ injection string was lowered close to the well bottom and a 5 -months stimulation operation with cold water pumping started. In May 2017, temperature logs were carried out after few days of heating up and confirmed bottom hole temperature of approximately 535  °C. After well stimulation, an attempt was made to seal off the main feed zone at 3400  m using biodegradable polymers. Unexpectedly, material totally blocked the well from downflowing and cooling was no longer possible. This resulted in week-long heating up of the production casing string and a serious casing damage between 2307 and 2380  m of well depth was discovered using wire-line logs. After retrieving the stimulation string, corrosion of latter assembly sections was observed. Currently, preparation for production tests is ongoing with the first flow tests planned for the first quarter of 2019 (iddp.com).|$|R
40|$|Operation and {{drilling}} in highly fractured carbonate formations {{are associated with}} several challenges. Some of the main challenges include large/total <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids,</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> hydrostatic pressure and gas influxes. One <b>of</b> the modern <b>drilling</b> technologies that provides a solution, is Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling (PMCD). The main principle of PMCD is to drill with a cheap sacrificial fluid that is forced into the fractured formation along with all cuttings. Nothing is circulated back to surface. The annulus is filled with a fluid designed to cause underbalanced pressure, which encourages influx of gas. When the pressure at the surface rises to a certain level due to gas migration, bullheading is used to force the kick {{back down into the}} formation. To help get a greater understanding of the pressure development before and during PMCD bullheading, computing software is used to model and simulate such complex flow scenarios. In the past, work has been done to implement a PMCD bullheading operation into a numerical scheme, which allowed for simulation and analysis. The model used is a transient model, which uses the numerical procedure of the AUSMV scheme to solve conservation equations from the drift flux model. MatLab computing software is used to perform the calculations, and the model is written in matlab programming language. The goal of this thesis is to continue building on the previous model, and increase the realism of the simulations. The previous version of the PMCD bullheading code, had shortcomings with regards to injection. Pressure development through time did not account for formation injectivity, and bottomhole injection pressure was fixed to an assumed value. During bullheading, all fluids were assumed to be injected without any resistivity from the formation. Also, during gas migration in the shut-in well, the model did not allow any fluids to flow back into the formation as the pressure increased in the bottom. In this thesis, the Injectivity Index model is implemented into the model to solve these two problems. The injectivity model was simulated and tested with two different methods of implementation, through the boundary cell fluxes, and through the source term of the partial differential equations. Tests were also done to see effects from different degree of injectivity. Compared to the original pressure plots, the new results showed a much more realistic pressure development, both during bullheading and during gas migration in shut-in well. The results also showed that the pressure development in the well is highly dependent on the injectivity of the formation. For simulation with injection through the bottom cell, the difference between the boundary cell flux method, and the source term method were insignificant. However, the source term method has an advantage, since it allows us to place the injection zone in any cell through the well. One problem was encountered though, for a high number of cells in the discretization, the pressure started to oscillate {{during the first half of}} the bullheading procedure, even though the timestep was adjusted. This was not solved, and needs further investigation. The Production Index (PI) model was also used in an experimental test, where the goal was to see if the gas kick could be taken through the model. Previously the kick was forced into the bottom of the well by a fixed rate. The results showed that a much smaller amount of gas mass was taken into the well. It is much harder to control how much gas that is taken, since in not only depends on the PI-value but also the pressure difference between the reservoir and the well, which varies through time. Some additional research was done to boundary treatment of slope limiters and pressure calculation. The original model came with two ways of doing the boundary cell calculation of slope limiters, one that extrapolated the values from the closest neighbor cell and one that fixed them to zero. The results showed minimal difference between the two slope limiter methods. Similar for pressure calculation in the boundary cells, there was two ways of doing it, one that extrapolated from the closest neighbor cell and one that calculated the pressure based on physical values. For the bottomhole pressure the results were very similar, but some difference was seen in the surface pressure...|$|R
