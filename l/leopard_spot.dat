5000|$|Jayne Mansfield's <b>leopard</b> <b>spot</b> bikini was regular {{wardrobe}} for {{actress and}} blonde bombshell Jayne Mansfield in her publicity stunts. Because of the costume {{she came to}} be known as [...] "the girl in the leopard bikini" [...] at times. Throughout the 1950s, she and her husband Mickey Hargitay posed for photos with her in the <b>leopard</b> <b>spot</b> bikini. The couple wore matching leopard spots to announce their closeness, and the costume won them a prize at a Hollywood costume party. Mansfield often walked down the Hollywood Boulevard in the leopard bikini signing autographs, once went shopping in the leopard bikini, and attended parties in it.|$|E
50|$|In a {{religious}} context, tiger rugs {{are related to}} the tiger skin loin cloths seen in painted images of fierce (wrathful) Tibetan Buddhist gods.

5000|$|The boonie hat was {{introduced}} to the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam War, when U.S. Army Green Berets began wearing them in the field, along with Australian and Army of the Republic of Vietnam units. These <b>leopard</b> <b>spot</b> or tigerstripe boonie hats were locally procured, the camouflage cloth was usually salvaged from other uniform items or with the former from a parachute or made up by the tailor. The name is derived from [...] "boonie", the abbreviated form of boondocks (itself originally American military slang derived from Tagalog bundok, [...] "mountain", during the Philippine-American War). The hat was similar to the hat worn with the pattern 1941 HBT fatigue uniform.|$|E
5000|$|When Mansfield and {{her husband}} Miklós Hargitay toured for stage shows, {{newspapers}} wrote that Mansfield convinced the rural population that she owned more bikinis than anyone. She showed {{a fair amount of}} her 40 in bust, as well as her midriff and legs, in the leopard-spot bikini she wore for her stage shows. [...] Kathryn Wexler of The Miami Herald wrote, [...] "In the beginning as we know it, there was Jayne Mansfield. Here she preens in leopard-print or striped bikinis, sucking in air to showcase her well noted physical assets." [...] Her leopard-skin bikini remains one of the earlier specimens of the fashion. As late as in 1982, she appeared in a full page color photograph in the <b>leopard</b> <b>spot</b> bikini in Tony Crawley's Screen Dreams: The Hollywood Pin-up. American Photo magazine printed photographer Bruno Bernard's photo of Mansfield in the costume in 2003.|$|E

40|$|Leopard, a {{well-known}} zebrafish mutant {{that has a}} spotted skin pattern instead of stripes, is {{a model for the}} study of pigment patterning. To understand the mechanisms underlying stripe formation, as well as the spot variation observed in leopard, we sought to identify the gene responsible for this phenotype. Using positional cloning, we identified the leopard gene as an orthologue of the mammalian connexin 40 gene. A variety of different leopard alleles, such as leot 1, leotq 270 and leotw 28, show different skin-pattern phenotypes. In this manuscript we show that the mutation in allele leot 1 is a nonsense mutation, whereas alleles leotq 270 and leotw 28 contain the missense mutations I 202 F and I 31 F, respectively. Patch-clamp experiments of connexin hemichannels demonstrated that the I 202 F substitution in allele leotq 270 disrupted the channel function of connexin 41. 8. These results demonstrate that mutations in this gene lead to a variety of <b>leopard</b> <b>spot</b> patterns...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} fundus autofluorescence (FAF) {{imaging and}} spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT) findings of <b>leopard</b> <b>spots</b> in nanophthalmic uveal effusion syndrome. Methods: A 34 -year-old man with retinal detachment associated with nanophthalmic uveal effusion syndrome in the right eye underwent sclerotomy three times. After the final surgery, the subretinal fluid resolved gradually. Then, SD-OCT examination, FAF photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were performed simultaneously with the spectralis Heidelberg retina angiograph + OCT system. Results: SD-OCT revealed focal thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer at the same locations as <b>leopard</b> <b>spots,</b> which appeared hypofluorescent on FA and ICGA. These spots showed hyperautofluorescence on FAF imaging. Six months later, focal thickening of the RPE layer became smaller on OCT and hyperautofluorescence was attenuated on FAF imaging. Conclusions: Simultaneous imaging of the fundus with multiple modalities including OCT, FAF, FA, and ICGA indicates that <b>leopard</b> <b>spots</b> in the fundus of uveal effusion syndrome may show hyperautofluorescence and correspond to focal thickening of the RPE layer by SD-OCT. This imaging method may help elucidate the pathology of various fundus lesions in vivo. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
