5|$|Moisture {{derived from}} John also {{produced}} rainfall across southern New Mexico, peaking at 5.25inches (133mm) at Ruidoso. The rainfall overflowed rivers, forcing people to evacuate along the Rio Ruidoso. The rainfall also caused isolated road flooding. Rainfall in New Mexico canceled an annual wine festival in <b>Las</b> <b>Cruces</b> and caused muddy {{conditions at the}} All American Futurity at the Ruidoso Downs, the biggest day of horse racing in New Mexico. Flooding was severe in Mesquite, Hatch, and Rincon, where many homes experienced 4feet (1.5m) of flooding and mud. Some homeowners lost all they owned. Tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in Arizona and Southern California. In California, the rainfall produced eight separate mudslides, trapping 19vehicles, but caused no injuries.|$|E

5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of <b>Las</b> <b>Cruces,</b> Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope.

La posible distribución geográfica de estas {{variables}} se muestra utilizando un análisis de componentes principales. Existe una coincidencia entre grupos de cantones obtenidos por similitud en diversidad de apellidos y la localización geográfica de los mismos en el territorio. Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en los valores obtenidos para los componentes de consanguinidad (F= 15. 6; p The {{human population}} {{structure of the}} Central Provinces of Costa Rica was analyzed through isonymic methods {{and the use of}} Electoral Registers (1990 and 2006). Four parameters that define, in a genetic and evolutionary context, this structure were estimated: the consanguinity due to random mating (Morton’s a-priori kinship Fii), the genetic isolation (Fisher’s &# 945;), the migration (Karlin-McGregor’s &# 965;), and the degree of subdivision or population differentiation (Fst). The possible geographical distribution of these variables is shown by the use of a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). There is a coincidence between groups of counties obtained by similarity in surname diversity and their geographic location in the territory. Differences were found for the values of the components of consanguinity (F= 15. 6; p< 0. 05) and genetic isolation (F= 14. 38; p< 0. 05) between different sectors of the Central Provinces. There is an association between population density and the breaking up of genetic isolates and another possible association between the geography of the region, the migration patterns of individuals, and the consequent levels of inbreeding and genetic isolation. The differences in the values of population structure components, inbreeding and genetic isolation, between the different zones of the central region, allow the assumption of the existence of differences in gene frequencies. The migration of blocks of genes from the center to the periphery is also possible and the variation in this sense might be attributed mostly to changes in the components of the population structure: mating patterns, migration and the consequence of the effective population size in the genetic drift process.
