50|$|Most {{authorities}} classify leloii as {{a junior}} synonym of the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, based a study by Farkas et al. However, some Vietnamese biologists, such as Hà Đình Đức, who first described leloii, and Le Tran Binh, insist that the two turtles {{are not the same}} species. Le points out genetic differences as well as differences in morphology, re-describing the Hoan Kiem turtle as Rafetus vietnamensis. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, stating that differences between specimens may be due to age. They also pointed out that <b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> did not adequately describe their methods for DNA sequencing, and that the genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank. They also criticized the fact that <b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> violated ICZN Code by renaming the species from leloii to vietnamensis on the grounds of “appropriateness”. Another genetic analysis was purportedly when the turtle was rescued and cleaned, which allegedly showed it to be female and distinct from the R. swinhoei of China and Đồng Mô, Vietnam. However, the results were not formally announced or ever published in a peer-reviewed research article, and some skepticism has been cast on the results.|$|E
30|$|The {{variations}} in volatile and trace elements composition are commonly explained by a compositional {{variation of the}} metasomatic agent (e.g. Straub <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2004]; <b>Le</b> Voyer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2008]; Sadofsky <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2008]; Bouvier <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2010]; Sorbadere <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2011]). The composition of the metasomatic agent is usually calculated from mass balance assuming a mixing between the depleted mantle (DMM) and this agent, either a slab aqueous fluid or a slab melt (e.g. Grove <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2002]; Straub and Layne [2003]; Straub <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2004]; <b>Le</b> Voyer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2010]). Considering that seawater is about 20, 000 times richer in Cl than F (e.g. Straub and Layne [2003]) and that Cl is highly soluble in slab aqueous fluids (e.g. Brenan [1993]), a Cl/F > 1 in arc melt inclusions is expected. The Cl/F ratio in aqueous fluid from slab dehydration {{was estimated to be}} approximately 4 (e.g. Mount Shasta, <b>Le</b> Voyer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2010]) or up to 9.5 (e.g. Izu arc front, Straub and Layne [2003]). In contrast, the low Cl/F (< 1) found in some arc melt inclusions (e.g. Central and South American arcs, Kermadec, Wysoczanski <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2006]; Sadofsky <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2008]; Vigouroux <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2008]; Mount Shasta, <b>Le</b> Voyer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2010]) cannot result from the mixing between a depleted source and an aqueous fluid. Instead, it was suggested that it was produced by mixing with a H 2 O-rich slab melt (e.g. <b>Le</b> Voyer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2010]), with a Cl/F approximately 1 (Figure  5 B).|$|R

5000|$|The {{placement}} of the related or conspecific Hoan Kiem turtle, Rafetus leloii, remains poorly known and controversial. Most herpetologists accept R. leloii is a junior synonym of the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, though some Vietnamese biologists, such as Ha Dinh Duc, who first described R. leloii, and Le Tran Binh, assert R. leloii to be distinct. Le points out genetic differences, as well as differences in morphology.

40|$|Fast purinergic {{neurotransmission}} {{has recently}} {{been shown to be}} mediated through ionotropic P 2 X receptors activated by extracellular adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP). P 2 X protein mapping within central nervous system (CNS), P 2 X channel subunit composition pertaining to relevant native receptor phenotypes, and species-specific differences between mammalian P 2 X orthologs remain to be investigated. The first manuscript (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1998 a) reported the regional, cellular, and subcellular localization of P 2 X 4 gene product within adult rat brain and spinal cord structures. P 2 X 4 receptors were shown to be widely expressed on the postsynaptic side throughout the CNS. The second manuscript (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1998 b) documented a novel P 2 X receptor phenotype resulting from the heteropolymerization between major central P 2 X 4 and P 2 X 6 subunits. P 2 X 4 + 6 heteromultimeric channel phenotypes were characterized by distinct time-dependent protein expression levels and novel pharmacological profiles compared to P 2 X 4 homo-oligomers. The third manuscript (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1999) was undertaken based upon similar reasoning as well as experimental strategies as the P 2 X 4 + 6 study (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1998 b). The existence of heteromultimeric P 2 X 1 + 5 receptors were screened with functional as well as biochemical assays demonstrating that this oligomeric complex gave rise to hybrid properties between homopolymeric P 2 X 1 and P 2 X 5 subunits. Reciprocal co-purifications between interacting P 2 X 1 and P 2 X 5 subunits were also demonstrated in this study. The fourth manuscript (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997) reported the molecular cloning of the human ortholog (hP 2 X 5 R) of rP 2 X 5 subunit, which is being the most rare transcript among all reported rat P 2 X cDNAs to date. hP 2 X 5 R subunit was found to be a 422 amino acid-long protein and having 62 % homology to rP 2 X 5 receptors. In an effort to contribute to a better assessment of the physiological roles of fast purinergic synaptic signaling (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1998 a) mediated likely by native receptors generated by heteromultimerization (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1998 b; <b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1999) while keeping in mind that species-dependent differences between mammalian P 2 X orthologs (<b>Le</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997) should be taken into account whenever rodent systems would be used for drug screening studies.

Recently, <b>Le</b> Meuer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>Le</b> Meur <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2006) confirmed that CYP 3 A 5 expressors require significantly higher sirolimus doses to reach the C 0 target range than non-expressors.
