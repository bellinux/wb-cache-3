40|$|Re-establishing a patient’s lost dental {{esthetic}} {{appearance is}} one of the most important topics for contemporary dentistry. New treatment materials and methods have been coming on the scene, day by day, in order to achieve such an aim. Most dentists prefer more conservative and aesthetic approaches, such as direct and indirect <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> restorations, instead of full-ceramic crowns for anteriors where aesthetics is really important. <b>Laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> are restorations which are envisioned to correct existing abnormalities, esthetic deficiencies and discolorations. <b>Laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> restorations may be processed in two different ways: direct or indirect. Direct <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> have no need to be prepared in the laboratory and are based on the principle of application of a composite material directly to the prepared tooth surface in the dental clinic. Indirect <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> may be produced from composite materials or ceramics, which are cemented to the tooth with an adhesive resin. In this case report, direct composite <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> technique used for three patients with esthetic problems related to fractures, discolorations and an old prolapsed restoration, is described and six-month follow-ups are discussed. As a conclusion, direct <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> restorations may be a treatment option for patients with the esthetic problems of anterior teeth in cases similar to those reported here...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the impact of thermocycling on the {{flexural}} strength and development of surface flaws on the glazed surface of porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> restorations with and without resin luting cement. Materials and Methods: 80 Vitadur alpha dentin porcelain discs (10 mm diameter, 0. 9 mm thickness) were glazed on one side and divided into two groups: A (porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> only without resin luting cement) and B (porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> luted with resin cement), each containing 40 discs. The discs in groups A and B were then thermocycled at different temperatures and were subjected to SEM analysis to evaluate the effect of thermocycling on crack propagation. Mean flexural strength was determined by using the ball-on-ring test. Student&#x 2032;s t -test was used to find out the difference between strength values of the thermocycled porcelain discs and discs luted with resin cement. Results: SEM analysis revealed crack propagation in the subgroups subjected to extremes of temperature, i. e., 4 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C, 37 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C and 4 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C, 65 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C in the porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> luted with resin cement. Flexural strength analysis revealed superior flexural strength for porcelain laminate veneers: 88. 58 &#x 00 B 1; 6. 94 Mpa when compared to porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> luted with resin cement: 8. 42 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 60 MPa. Results were tabulated and statistically analyzed using Student&#x 2032;s t -test. Conclusion: <b>Laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> specimens exhibited greater flexural strength than those which were luted with resin cements. <b>Laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> specimens luted with resin cement and subjected to extremes of temperature, 4 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C and 37 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C and 4 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C and 65 &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C, showed a marked decrease in flexural strength.

40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{long-term}} clinical performance of porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> bonded to teeth prepared {{with the use}} of an additive mock-up and aesthetic pre-evaluative temporary (APT) technique over a 12 -year period. Sixty-six patients were restored with 580 porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> The technique, used for diagnosis, esthetic design, tooth preparation, and provisional restoration fabrication, was based on the APT protocol. The influence of several factors on the durability of veneers was analyzed according to pre- and postoperative parameters. With utilization of the APT restoration, over 80 % of tooth preparations were confined to the dental enamel. Over 12 years, 42 <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> failed, but when the preparations were limited to the enamel, the failure rate resulting from debonding and microleakage decreased to 0 %. Porcelain <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> presented a successful clinical performance in terms of marginal adaptation, discoloration, gingival recession, secondary caries, postoperative sensitivity, and satisfaction with restoration shade at the end of 12 years.

40|$|Purpose: This {{randomized}} controlled split-mouth clinical trial evaluated the short-term survival rate of indirect resin composite and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patients (mean age: 48. 6 years) received 46 indirect resin composite (Estenia; n = 23) and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> (IPS Empress Esthetic; n = 23) on the maxillary anterior teeth. Veneer preparations with incisal overlap were performed and existing resin composite restorations of good quality were not removed but conditioned using silica coating (CoJet) and silanization (ESPE-Sil). Enamel and dentin were etched and rinsed; adhesive resin (ExciTE) was then applied. After cementation (Variolink Veneer), restorations were evaluated at baseline and thereafter every 6 months {{for up to}} 3 years using modified USPHS criteria. Results: Seventeen <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> were bonded onto intact teeth and 29 on teeth having existing resin composite restorations. In total, 3 failures were observed {{in the form of}} debonding (n = 1) and fracture (n = 2) in the group of resin composite <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> No significant difference was observed between the survival rates of composite and ceramic <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> (Estenia: 87 %, IPS Empress Esthetic: 100 %; p > 0. 05). The overall survival rate was 93. 5 % (Kaplan-Meier). Of the 43 <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers,</b> minor voids and defects were observed in 6 of the composite and 3 of the ceramic veneers.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{compared}} the fracture strength of {{direct and indirect}} resin composite <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> and evaluated {{the effect of a}} bidirectional E-glass woven fiber application at different locations at the cementation interface. Methods. Standard preparations on canines (N = 50, 10 per group) were made using a depth cutting bur (0. 7 mm depth) designed for <b>laminate</b> <b>veneer</b> restorations. Forty indirect laminates using a highly filled polymeric material (Estenia) and 10 direct laminates (Quadrant Anterior Shine) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bidirectional E-glass woven-fiber sheet (0. 06 mm) (Everstick) was applied at different locations at the cementation interface. The control group received no fibers. The specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 1 month prior to fracture testing performed in a universal testing machine where the load was applied from the incisal direction at 137 degrees (1 mm/min). Results. No {{significant differences were found between}} the five groups (P > 0. 01) (one-way ANOVA). While indirect <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> showed mean fracture strength of 247 +/- 47 N, direct <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> revealed 239 104 N. The use of E-glass fibers at the cementation interface at different locations did not increase the fracture strength significantly (286 - 313 N) (P > 0. 01). Failure analysis showed mainly cohesive fracture of the veneer restoration (20 / 50) and adhesive failure between the cementation interface and the laminate with fiber exposure (19 / 50) covering more than half of the restorations. Significance. Direct and indirect resin composite <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers</b> showed comparable mean fracture strengths. The use of E-glass woven-fiber sheet at the cementation interface did not increase the fracture strength of the polymeric <b>laminate</b> <b>veneers.</b> (c) 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.

50|$|A leading {{manufacturer}} and marketer of building and lumber products, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LP) revolutionized the industry by inventing alternatives to plywood and solid wood building products. Instead {{of relying on}} larger, more expensive old-growth timber, LP found ways to make structural building products from small-diameter, fast-growing trees. LP pioneered the use of oriented strand board (OSB) — a reconstituted plywood substitute made by pressing wood wafers together. OSB {{is the basis for}} many of LP's structural building products. LP also manufacturers industrial wood products, such as hardboard and medium density fiberboard, which are used by furniture and cabinet makers. Furthermore, along with wood products such as LPI joists and <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> lumber, the company also produces Cocoon cellulose insulation. Plywood and pulp manufacturing round out LP's operations. The company controls over 950,000 acres of timberland, and owns plants in 29 states, as well as in Canada and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Suwyn also {{concentrated}} on developing LP's specialty products lines. As its past innovations had become industry standards (and were imitated by numerous competitors), {{it was essential}} for LP to launch new products {{that would give the}} company an edge over its rivals. To further this goal, LP engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions. In 1996, LP purchased Associated Chemists, a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry, as well as GreenStone Industries, a manufacturer of cellulose insulation, and Tecton Laminates Corp., a producer of <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> lumber and wood I-joists used in the construction industry. Two years later, LP acquired ABT Building Products Corporation, a transaction it heralded as a way 'to expand its specialty products lines and complement its low-cost commodity building products,' according to the Wall Street Journal. In 1999, LP purchased Evans Forest Products Ltd., a Canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products.|$|E
50|$|LP's OSB {{products}} {{protected the}} company {{from some of the}} vicissitudes of the timber market. Buoyed by this success, the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include I-beams for floor joists and rafters. These structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts, yet were stronger and lighter. LP also introduced a concrete form of Inner-Seal, and in 1985 began to market Inner-Seal siding for the exterior of homes. Driven by these breakthroughs, a housing boom, and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products, LP's sales grew 50 percent between 1980 and 1988, according to the Portland Oregonian. During the same period, its profits increased 400 percent. Moreover, OSB products accounted for an escalating portion of the company's total sales. Only six percent of sales in 1980, the Inner-Seal line by 1990 amounted to almost 30 percent of total sales volume. LP's sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from 53 to 30 percent over the same period. In 1986, the company purchased Kirby Forest Industries and the California properties of Timber Realization Company. From these transactions, LP gained almost 830,000 acres of timberland, which helped balance the land taken in 1978 for Redwood National Park. (LP received a final payment of $440 million from the government for this land in 1988.) In 1990, LP bought Weather Guard Inc., a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint, as well as MiTek Wood Products, a North Carolina-based producer of <b>laminated</b> <b>veneer</b> lumber and engineered wood I-beams.|$|E
