5000|$|... 1964 models {{could be}} {{identified}} by a widened <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style {{to the end of}} the 1965 model run.|$|E
50|$|A {{more heavily}} facelifted Fortuner was {{released}} in late 2011. It is slightly longer and lower than the outgoing model. The front fascia was completely revised with a new fender, hood, grille, headlamps, bumper and fog <b>light</b> <b>housing.</b> The tail lamps along with the rear bumper, rear garnish plate were also revised. Changes in the sides includes a new sharper tire flairs, LED integrated side view mirrors and the wheels was also redesigned similar to the 2012 Hilux's. Minor changes were also made to the interior including the centre console, steering wheel and audio/video system were also upgraded. The Fortuner also receives a new VNT (Variable Nozzle Turbo) intercooled turbo engine.|$|E
50|$|This {{version was}} also {{released}} in 1991, {{and is very}} similar to the E-spec (as they are built in the same place), but with minor changes. The version sold in Japan was exclusive to Japanese Mazda dealerships, and was not badge engineered and sold at other Mazda Japanese dealerships, unlike the MX-3, the MX-5, and the RX-7 coupes. One-piece headlights were fitted, with indicators incorporated in the fog <b>light</b> <b>housing,</b> as well as a different rear bumper with smaller registration plate cutout, similar to the A-spec. Almost everything was an option, but the 4WS was available, as well as the digital climate control, electric folding mirrors, larger centre console, and of course, the Mazdaspeed body add-ons - a subtle lip kit with Supra-style high-rise rear spoiler.|$|E

5000|$|For 1961, Dodge {{dropped the}} Matador, leaving the Polara {{as the sole}} [...] "senior" [...] Dodge model. Darts on the shorter {{wheelbase}} continued. For 1961, Exner's styling department reversed the car's fins, making them taller as they flowed toward the rear window. As the fins sloped towards {{the rear of the}} car, they cut slightly towards the center (to allow the single tail <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> on each side) of the rear of the vehicle, wrapping downward and then back along the side fender to form a C-shaped line accentuated in chrome. The overall effect made the rear of the car seem to [...] "pucker" [...] from the angles the design created. Up front, the massive bumper treatments that had been a Dodge hallmark since 1957 were replaced with a simple bar design, above which was a massive concave grille shared with the Dodge Dart.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{genuinely}} original style used in renovations of early Métro stations {{is known as}} Ouï-dire ("Hearsay"), after the design firm responsible for the design. Beginning with Stalingrad (line 7) in 1988, around 30 stations were decorated in this style. Ouï-dire's main component was a new <b>light</b> <b>housing,</b> cradled by distinctive scythe-shaped supports. Its hidden upper side projected light through colored filters directly onto {{the ceiling of the}} vault, illuminating it in a rainbow of multiple colors. The style initially featured distinctive seating complemented by high, [...] "sit-lean" [...] benches, but these fixtures proved difficult and costly to maintain and in many cases were replaced by standard Motte-style seating in the 1990s. The tiling in almost all of the Ouï-dire stations was replaced by the flat white Motte rectangular tiles. As with the Motte renovations, three distinct color schemes (red, yellow and green) were put into place, with each station's chairs, light fixtures, and poster frames built in matching colors, but the effect was more subtle than the use of color in the Motte stations.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-to-late 1990s, {{with both}} Motte and Oui-dire styles having come and gone, the RATP began to give {{thought to the}} {{decoration}} used for future station renovations. In 1996 the station Saint-Augustin on line 9 {{was chosen as the}} trial station for a new renovation style. Its original feature is a new <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> (known as the Bruno-Gaudin light fixture) with a wide wave-shaped reflecting surface which is attached to and follows the curve of the vault, hides the bare fluorescent bulbs seen throughout the metro after World War II, and also hides cables efficiently. The style, which focuses on maximizing the amount of light in the stations and hiding unsightly fixtures, also returns to the classic, tried-and-true, beveled white tile, which reflects light better than all other types that have been used on the system. For this reason, Bruno-Gaudin can be seen to represent a return to the design charter of the original métro of 1900, and represents a kind of [...] "neo-CMP" [...] aesthetic. The style has also seen the introduction of a new type of seating: a curved, rounded, individual seat called the coque, or shell model, after its distinctive shape.|$|E
5000|$|Consortium {{system was}} quite flawed as {{sometimes}} houses in same consortium suffer interest conflicts. For example, in the 2016 Iron man camp final, Orange Flower [...] <b>House</b> and Purple <b>Light</b> <b>house</b> were formed as Human Consortium. On the House marathon contest, the orange flower house' member intentionally friendly fire {{and took off}} the main castle of Purple <b>Light</b> <b>House,</b> and that creates lots of madness reaction from the Purple <b>Light</b> <b>House.</b> Finally, in the second night's campfire, the invader of Orange House officially apologized to the Purple <b>Light</b> <b>House's</b> leader and stops the consortium from collapsing. However, this surely affected the outcome as Purple Light and Orange Flower both failed to earn a Star reward.|$|R

50|$|The 260Z {{claimed a}} few updates and {{improvements}} over the 240Z. The climate controls were more sensibly laid out {{and easier to}} work, and those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into the main climate control panel. There was also additional stiffness in the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and extended further back than previous models. A rear sway bar was added as well. The 260Z debuted a redesigned dashboard and console, {{as well as new}} seat trim, and door panels for the interior. The tail lights were updated, moving the back up lights from the main tail <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> to the back panel. Early 1974 US 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier 240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips. These early cars still had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S. 260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z so as to be in compliance with United States bumper legislation in 1973. These late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the front grill, above the bumper.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, front turn {{indicators}} were {{moved from the}} top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection, a derivative of the Bosch D-Jetronic system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin [...] "pea shooter" [...] tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance. 5 mph bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the VW-Porsche 914) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle. The [...] "Volkswagen" [...] script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a [...] "Fuel Injection" [...] badge.|$|E
40|$|Alphonse N'Kobessa of the Forum des jeunes producteurs pour le développement, Brazzaville, Republic of Congo is {{interested}} in raising quail and has asked us for practical information. We have summarized below some {{of the points that}} should be considered but, in general, measures which are appropriate for raising chickens are also appropriate for quail. The quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) responds well to intensive production. However it must be remembered that it is a bird of temperate climates and that, ideally, it should be raised within a temperature range of 20 - 22 ° C. Quail are sensitive to light and good laying will require 14 to 18 hours of daylight, which is the time during which the bird is awake. This length of time can be interrupted by short periods of darkness. Lamps can be used to prolong daylight hours and electricity saved by using low voltage lamps or by splitting the times of artificial <b>light.</b> <b>Housing</b> must be well ventilated, with wire netting partition walls and a roof that provides good protection against sun and rain. Ideally the floor should be of concrete to ease cleaning and help with hygiene. In good conditions, quail can lay an egg a day (with peak production between the tenth and twentieth week) for 8 to 10 months, producing a minimum of 200 eggs per year. The number of chicks will average between 180 and 240. The chicks will need zinc and choline in their feed, and protein and amino acid requirement will also be high, particularly to start off with. The birds are slaughtered at 45 days when they should weigh between 130 and 160 g or they may be left until 50 days in order {{to improve the quality of}} the meat.

40|$|Mammalian {{circadian}} rhythms {{are generated}} and regulated by a pacemaker {{located in the}} suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Transmission of photic information to the SCN occurs via a direct projection from the retina, the retinohypothalamic tract, and an indirect projection from the retinorecipient intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), the geniculohypothalamic tract. The retinohypothalamic tract is necessary for synchronization of rhythms to environmental light-dark cycles. In contrast, although the IGL is strategically located to convey light information to the SCN, a role for the IGL in photic entrainment has not been established. IGL-lesioned hamsters {{have been shown to}} entrain normally to light-dark cycles; effects of the lesion have been manifested in slower rates of re-entrainment to shifts in the light-dark cycle and small changes in the size of light-induced phase shifts. In the present thesis, the relationship between the IGL and the circadian response to light is explored in two sets of experiments. The first three experiments evaluated activation of IGL neurons by light using immunohistochemical expression of Fos protein as a marker of cellular activation. In rodents, light-induced Fos in SCN neurons is phase dependent and is correlated with the effectiveness of such light to phase shift circadian rhythms. Furthermore, because the IGL has been implicated in the effects of nonphotic stimuli on circadian rhythms, the induction of Fos in the SCN and IGL in response to nonphotic manipulations was assessed. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to light-induced Fos in the SCN, light induces Fos protein in the IGL regardless of circadian time, and continues to do so as long as the animal is exposed to light. Moreover, nonphotic manipulations induce Fos in both SCN and IGL. However, in the IGL, Fos expression in response to such treatments was enhanced during the light phase of the light-dark cycle. Pharmacological manipulations that attenuate both light-induced phase shift and Fos expression in the SCN are without effect on light-induced Fos expression in the IGL. The effects of electrolytic lesions of the IGL on circadian temperature rhythms were examined under different lighting schedules in the final two experiments using a telemetry system. Rhythms in these animals were compared to those of intact controls as well as to rhythms of rats with neurotoxic damage to the visual system resulting from neonatal monosodium. glutamate (MSG) treatment. IGL-lesioned rats entrained normally to light-dark cycles consisting of 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness, and showed the disruption of rhythmicity after prolonged constant <b>light</b> <b>housing</b> seen in intact animals. However, in contrast to intact and MSG-treated rats, IGL-lesioned animals exhibited free-running temperature rhythms under a skeleton photoperiod consisting of one-hour of light exposure at times corresponding to dusk and dawn. Because nocturnal animals normally experience light only around dusk and dawn, the inability to entrain to this ecologically relevant lighting schedule suggests that the IGL plays a critical role in photic entrainment...|$|E
