50|$|Though {{the park}} is open {{throughout}} the year, the period between monsoon and winter (normally, mid-June {{to the end of}} March) is recommended. The best time to visit is from December to March as many species of migratory birds including three species of harriers, the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican,</b> eagles and waders.|$|E

The 44 threatened and declining bird species of the grasslands include the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Sypheotides indica), sarus crane (Grus antigone) and rufous-rumped grassbird (Graminicola bengalensis).|$|E
50|$|Dharmakumarsinhji had wide-ranging {{interests}} and talents. He {{emerged as a}} pioneer in the field of Indian wildlife photography as well as an amateur painter, having won awards in both fields. In his youth, he was an enthusiastic hunter, a collector of avian eggs, and also a keen falconer with an exquisite collection of birds from the genus Falco. His interest in birds led him to undertake field studies of the Great Indian Bustard and the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Florican.</b>|$|E
50|$|The only bird even {{remotely}} similar to adult males of the Bengal florican are their counterpart from the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Sypheotides indica). This is a smaller, slimmer-necked bustard overall, and its males have cheek-tufts of plumes with pennant-like tips {{rather than the}} crest, and a white band between neck and back. The females are similar, and young Bengal floricans can be easily mistaken for female lesser floricans. The latter have almost white wing coverts however, resembling the males' wing patch.|$|E
50|$|The Deccan thorn scrub {{forests are}} home to a richer variety of birds: almost 350 species, of which three are {{considered}} near-endemic: Jerdon's courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus), Sri Lanka junglefowl (Gallus lafayetii), and yellow-fronted barbet (Megalaima flavifrons). Among these, the Jerdon's courser is also considered a globally threatened species, and was rediscovered in this ecoregion in 1986 after being recorded {{for the last time}} in 1900. Other globally threatened bird species such as the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Sypheotides indicus) and Indian bustard can also be found in the ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 75 mammal species. Threatened species {{include the}} Indian elephant (Elephas maximus), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), gaur (Bos gaurus), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macruora). Salim Ali's fruit bat (Latidens salimalii) is critically endangered, and is near-endemic. 260 species of birds live in the eco-region, and two, the rufous babbler (Turdoides subrufus) and yellow-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus xantholaemus) are near-endemic. The threatened great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Eupodotis indica) inhabit the eco-region.|$|E
50|$|Mangroves are an {{important}} coastal habitat for much wildlife such as the saltwater crocodiles who shelter among the roots and feed of the fish and other seafood in this warm mixture of fresh and seawater. These mangroves are home many insects, molluscs, shrimp, crabs and fish as well as 140 bird species, including the threatened <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Eupodotis indica), {{best known for the}} male birds' leaping breeding displays, and large communities of aquatic birds such as egrets, flamingoes (Phoenicoptreus spp.), spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis), spoonbills (Platalea spp.), and painted storks (Mycteria leucocephala).|$|E
50|$|The sanctuary, in the Kurnool {{district}} of Andhra Pradesh, {{is close to}} the state's border with Karnataka and is 45 km from the district headquarters of Kurnool. Covering an area of 6.14 km2, it was established in 1988 to protect the great Indian bustard and the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> and remains the only habitat in Andhra Pradesh for the bustard which is a critically endangered species. The sanctuary is mostly an undulating plain with hot, dry climatic conditions and erratic and uneven rainfall. It has an average elevation of 290 metres and receives about 450 mm of rainfall annually.|$|E
5000|$|The rapid {{reduction}} {{of the population of}} India's bustards, their endangered status and the decline of grasslands led the Ministry of Environment and Forests to prepare species recovery programs in 2012 for three species of bustard; the great Indian bustard, the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) and the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> (Sypheotides indicus). These programs remain to be finalised and executed by the state wildlife departments. The state of Rajasthan initiated [...] "Project Great Indian Bustard", on World Environment Day 2013, identifying and fencing off bustard breeding grounds in existing protected areas as well as provide secure breeding enclosures in areas outside protected areas.|$|E
50|$|Velavadar Blackbuck National Park is {{the only}} {{tropical}} grassland in India recognised as a National park. It is spread over an area of 34.08 km2. The park contains mainly blackbuck, antelopes, nilgai, wolves, jackals, hyenas, jungle cats, fox, and wild boar. Endangered birds such as Houbara Bustard, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Florican,</b> Sarus White Storks, White Pelican, Montagu, and Pallid harrier also call the park home. Raptors including the Greater Spotted Eagle, Juvenile Imperial Eagle, Bonelli's Eagle, Short-toed Snake Eagle, and Long-legged Buzzard are also seen in the park. The climate in Velavdar National Park makes {{it one of the}} best places for the migrating birds to breed.|$|E
50|$|There is bird {{watching}} for Bengal florican, giant horn bill, <b>lesser</b> <b>florican,</b> black stork and white stork. One {{can also see}} one horned rhinos, royal Bengal tiger, chital, hog deer, barking deer, sloth bear, palm civet, languor rhesus monkey and the gharial crocodile {{along with many other}} common species such as gaur, elephant, hyena, pangolin, Gangetic dolphin, monitor lizard and stripped. The village has a wide area for sporting activities. Every year sports like para jumping and elephant polo are held in Meghauli. One can also see the local Tharu stick dance, tiger dance and mask dance ghost dance which are popular in this village.|$|E
50|$|The main {{bird species}} of the sanctuary, the great Indian bustard, locally called “Ghorad,” is a Schedule I bird under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. It is {{included}} in the Red Data list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). According to the studies conducted by the Bombay Natural History Society on three Indian bustard species - namely the great Indian bustard, the <b>lesser</b> <b>florican</b> and the Bengal florican - the estimated total population of the great Indian bustard in all 12 sanctuaries in the country is said to be only about 1,000, out of which only about 30 birds had last been counted within the sanctuary, second only to the Desert National Park in Rajasthan which reportedly had about 70-75 birds.|$|E
