5|$|The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode <b>lock</b> <b>systems,</b> while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E

2500|$|In 1849, under {{a decree}} by the New York Legislature, the Gowanus Creek was deepened {{so that it}} {{could be used as a}} [...] {{commercial}} waterway connected to Upper New York Bay. The dredging of Gowanus Creek was completed in 1860. Another act of the legislature in 1867 allowed the canal to be deepened further. At the time the , [...] canal was built, several designs were proposed for it, some with <b>lock</b> <b>systems</b> that would have allowed daily flushing of the whole waterway. However, these designs were considered too expensive. After exploring numerous alternative (and some more environmentally sound) designs, the final plan was chosen for its low price tag. United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Major David Bates Douglass was hired to design the canal, which was essentially complete by 1869. The cost of the construction came from assessments on the local residents of Brooklyn and State money. However, this soon backfired, as the canal was constructed with significant design flaws.|$|E

30|$|The main {{difference}} between analog and digital DLLs is the <b>locking</b> <b>system,</b> or {{sometimes called the}} control module as it is responsible for controlling the delay of the delay line based on {{the output of the}} PD. In digital DLLs, the <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> can be implemented as a counter, a FSM, or a shift-register. However, in analog DLLs, a CMOS CP with an analog integrated filter is used to implement the <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> (Nuyts et al. 2014; Xanthopoulos 2009). Moreover, analog DLLs generally have smaller footprints as well as better delay resolution, linearity, and jitter performance than digital DLLs.|$|R

40|$|A passive {{decomposition}} {{framework for}} the formation and maneuver controls for multiple rigid bodies is proposed. In this approach, the group dynamics of the multiple agents is decomposed into two decoupled systems: The shape system representing internal group formation shape (formation, in short), and the <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> abstracting the overall group maneuver as a whole (maneuver, in short). The decomposition is natural in that the shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> have dynamics similar to the mechanical systems, and the total energy is preserved. The shape and <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> can be decoupled {{without the use of}} net energy. The decoupled shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> can be controlled individually to achieve the desired formation and maneuver tasks. Since all agents are given equal status, the proposed scheme enforces a group coherence among the agents. By abstracting a group maneuver by its <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> whose dynamics {{is similar to that of}} a single agent, a hierarchical control structure for the multiple agents can be easily imposed in the proposed framework. A decentralized version of the controller is also proposed, which requires only undirected line communication (or sensing) graph topology. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2764507...|$|R
