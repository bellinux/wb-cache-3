40|$|Grid environments {{present a}} virtual black box to {{scientists}} running <b>legacy</b> <b>applications,</b> with the Grid infrastructure effectively hiding the running application on a resource {{over which the}} scientist generally has limited or no control. Existing moni-toring systems that allow Grid-enabled applications to communicate their progress and receive steering information are inapplicable as they require code modification, and this not possible in true legacy scenarios. While a black box approach may be ac-ceptable in batch execution scenarios, it means the Grid is cut off to <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> where inter-actions or intermediate results are required. In this paper we present gridMonSteer, a sim-ple, non-intrusive architecture that allows scien-tists to receive intermediate results and interact with <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> running in a Grid envi-ronment. This architecture is Grid middleware in-dependent and can be employed to monitor ap-plications submitted via any Grid resource man-ager (e. g. GRAM, GRMS or Condor/G) or run-ning within a Grid service framework. We present a case study describing how gridMonSteer enables <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> to act as active components in Grid workflows, dynamically driving and steering the workflow execution. ...|$|R

5000|$|Initially, WSIPC had {{developed}} their own Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application in-house, called WISE, which not only provided a complete SIS, but also information management for both finance and student data. Starting in 2001 WSIPC collaborated with Skyward and, as a result, completely restructured the computing infrastructure at WSIPC, replacing the <b>legacy</b> <b>application</b> offerings with one integrated ERP application provided to WSIPC customers. [...] WSIPC called its ERP application WESPaC (WSIPC Enhanced Skyward Point and Click) which included Skyward's software suite of student, human resources and financial management modules. WESPaC also included Citrix's MetaFrame which provided users with remote access. Skyward eventually converted its thick client student application into a web interface and part of its finance software to have a web front end. The other part of their finance software is still thick client. Therefore, WESPaC has now evolved into two applications, one being a web-based student application and the other being a finance application that is partly web-based and partly thick client. Both of these applications are currently provided by Skyward.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transaction}} processing capability {{was developed in}} the late 1960s as a joint project with United Airlines and later refined in another joint project with Air Canada. This capability was fully integrated into the operating system in 1972 and became the basis of much of the future growth of the 1100 Series. Early users controlled communication lines directly from within their real time programs. Part of the development of {{transaction processing}} included a communication message system that managed the communication lines and presented messages to Exec 8 to be scheduled as transactions. This moved all the low level communication physical line management and protocols out of the applications and into the CMS 1100 application. [...] CMS 1100 itself ran as a real time multi-threaded program with the privilege of acquiring control of communication lines and submitting transaction messages for scheduling. This led to the notions in Exec 8 that applications of any nature needed to be carefully controlled to ensure that they could not cause integrity issues. Security was certainly a concern, but in the early days system reliability and integrity were much larger issues. The system was still primarily batch and transaction processing and there was little chance that anyone could install unauthorized code on the system. CMS 1100 later added the capability to be the interface for demand terminals as well as transaction terminals so that terminals could be used for both and the early terminal drivers could be removed from the Exec. CMS 1100 was later replaced by a combination of CPComm (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform) and SILAS (System Interface for <b>Legacy</b> <b>Application</b> Systems).For the Intel-based Dorado server models, the lower level communications were moved to firmware, with the upper levels handled by SILAS and CPCommOS (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform for Open Systems).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Modernization of a <b>legacy</b> <b>application</b> is {{not very}} hard any more. Whereas {{this may have been}} true a couple of years ago, this paper {{describes}} a case study, which shows that the modernization is significantly easier if modern integration tools, a service-oriented architecture and Web services are used. This is by contrast to a common belief that the modernization is always hard, regardless of the technologies used. The case study, where bachelor students succeeded to carry out the modernization of a <b>legacy</b> <b>application,</b> shakes that belief. The students neither had previous experience with the technologies used in the <b>legacy</b> <b>application</b> nor with the ones used for the modernization.

40|$|Providing {{support for}} <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> {{is a crucial}} {{component}} of many overlay networks, as it allows end-users to instantly benefit from the functionality introduced by these overlays. This paper presents the design and implementation of a proxy-based solution to support <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> {{in the context of}} the i 3 overlay [24]. The proxy design relies on an address virtualization technique which allows the proxy to tunnel the legacy traffic over the overlay transparently. Our solution can preserve IP packet headers on an end-to-end basis, even when end-host IP addresses change, or when endhosts live in different address spaces (e. g., behind NATs). In addition, our solution allows the use of human-readable names to refer to hosts or services, and requires no changes to applications or operating systems. To illustrate how the proxy enables <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> to take advantage of the overlay (i. e., i 3) functionality, we present four examples: enabling access to machines behind NAT boxes, secure Intranet access, routing legacy traffic through Bro, an intrusion detection system, and anonymous web download. We have implemented the proxy on Linux and Windows XP/ 2000 platforms, and used it over the i 3 service on PlanetLab over a three month period with a variety of <b>legacy</b> <b>applications</b> ranging from web browsers to operating system-specific file sharing. ...|$|R
