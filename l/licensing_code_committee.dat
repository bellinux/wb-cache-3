5000|$|<b>Code</b> <b>licensed</b> under LGPL is {{permitted}} to be linked with any other code no matter what <b>license</b> that <b>code</b> has, though the LGPL does add additional requirements for the combined work. LGPLv3 and GPLv2-only can thus commonly not be linked, as the combined Code work would add additional LGPLv3 requirements {{on top of the}} GPLv2-only <b>licensed</b> software. <b>Code</b> <b>licensed</b> under LGPLv2.x without the [...] "any later version" [...] statement can be relicensed if the whole combined work is licensed to GPLv2 or GPLv3.|$|R

50|$|Software {{that employs}} this {{additional}} security keeps {{a copy of}} the actual serial number being used in the <b>license</b> <b>code.</b> When it is active, it is broadcasting this number on a clandestine channel on the local network. If the software has been installed on another computer on that same network, using the same <b>license</b> <b>code,</b> when the second copy is run it will detect its serial number in use on the network and typically will refuse to run. It may also cause the other copy of itself already in use to close. This prevents a small business from buying one copy of expensive software and installing it on several of the computers at their location, provided they are networked.|$|R
