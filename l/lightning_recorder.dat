5000|$|Laser film recorder, like Kodak's {{high-end}} <b>Lightning</b> II <b>recorder</b> and Arri's Arrilaser.|$|R
50|$|Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II film <b>recorder</b> {{used both}} gas and diode laser to record on to film.|$|R
50|$|Kodak <b>Lightning</b> I film <b>recorder.</b> One of {{the first}} laser recorders. Needed an {{engineering}} staff to set up.|$|R
25|$|O Brother, Where Art Thou? was {{the first}} time a digital {{intermediate}} was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects. The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution, a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color, and a Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II <b>recorder</b> to put out to film.|$|R
50|$|The 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit DataCine, color {{corrected}} with a VDC-2000 and a Pandora Int. Pogle Color Corrector with MegaDEF. A Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II film <b>recorder</b> {{was used}} to output the data back on to film.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the late}} 1980s Glenn Kennel was the {{principal}} architect of the Cineon digital film system. Kennel led {{the development of the}} Cineon CCD film scanner and laser Film <b>recorder</b> (the <b>Lightning</b> film <b>recorder)</b> in Rochester NY. From February 1990, the Cineon workstation software was written by a team based at Kodak in Melbourne, Australia led by Lindsay Arnold. In early 1995, development moved to Kodak in Rochester, NY, where it was led by David Cok and Jim Minno. In about 1996, software development moved to Palo Alto, California ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} lightning phenomena {{with a brief}} {{explanation of}} lightning generation and lightning activity as related to KSC. An analysis of the instrumentation used at launching Pads 39 A&B for measurements of lightning effects is included with alternatives and recommendations to improve the protection system and upgrade the actual instrumentation system. An architecture for a new data collection system to replace the present one is also included. A novel architecture to obtain lightning current information from several sensors using only one high speed recording channel while monitoring all sensors to replace the actual manual <b>lightning</b> current <b>recorders</b> and a novel device for the protection system are described...|$|R
5000|$|The 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit Datacine, colour-corrected with a VDC-2000 using a Pandora Int. Pogle Colour Corrector with MegaDEF at Kodak's Hollywood Cinesite facility. A Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II film <b>recorder</b> {{was used}} to record the data output back to film. This process helped change the trees and grass {{backgrounds}} from green to a yellow/brown, creating the 1930s [...] "Dustbowl" [...] effect wanted by the Coen Brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakins.|$|R
5000|$|The 1998 movie Pleasantville was {{the first}} digital {{intermediate}} film scanned on a Spirit DataCine. This process produced the mix of B&W and color pictures. A movie released in 2000, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit Datacine, color corrected with a VDC-2000 using a Pandora Int. Pogle Color Corrector with MegaDEF. A Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II film <b>recorder</b> was used to put the data output back to film. This process changed the greens to a green-yellow color for the complete film.|$|R
5000|$|A Spirit DataCines outputing DPX files {{was used}} in the 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The DPX files were color {{corrected}} with a VDC-2000 and a Pandora Int. Pogle Color Corrector with MegaDEF. [...] A Kodak <b>Lightning</b> II film <b>recorder</b> was used to put the data output to back to film. To output the movie the Spirit Datacineâ€™s Phantom Transfer Engine software running on an SGI computer is used to record the DPX files from the Spirit DataCine. These files are stored in the virtual telecine or on a SAN hard disk storage array. The Phantom Transfer Engine has been replaced with Bones software running on a Linux-based PC. First generation of DPX interface for data files was the optical fiber HIPPI cables (up to 6 frame/s at 2K), the next generation interface is GSN-Gigabit Ethernet fiber Optic (up to 30 frame/s at 2K). GSN is also called HIPPI-6400 and was later renamed GSN (for Gigabyte System Network). The SAN hard disks are interfaces to by dual FC-Fibre Channel, cables. The newest DPX output interface is infiniband.|$|R
