500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{called it}} a good, but difficult, episode, saying, [...] "the story lines were all {{parallel}} – it was even an anthology, with each story mirroring the next (bringing to mind that memorable scene when Roger, under the influence, is <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and told to look away) ... the themes of male-female entanglement, and disentangle (and yes, hair, once again is a predominant metaphor.) The themes of travel ... of being a stranger {{in a strange land}} ... of life on Mars, or in Plattsburgh ... of alienation, pursuit, and of a generation born during the Holocaust, amid the Holocaust".|$|E
500|$|The {{front cover}} of Life Is Peachy depicts a boy <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> seeing {{a much larger}} person behind him. The photo was taken by Martin Riedl. The design and concept were by Scott Leberacht. Other {{pictures}} in the booklet were taken by Stephen Stickler. Doug Small said that it [...] "continued the threatened child theme as depicted on Korn's artwork." [...] The cover is mostly black and white, with a little boy, hair combed, straightening his tie in a gilt mirror; behind him looms a larger, shadowed presence." [...] Life Is Peachy is, to date, the only album by Korn to feature their name spelled in a different font.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it was like I was <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> at her reflection and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|Futurology, {{according}} to the band, is an album full of ideas and {{one of their most}} optimistic yet, as Wire said to the NME magazine in an interview: [...] "There's an overriding concept behind 'Futurology' which is to express all the inspiration we get from travel, music and art– all those ideas, do that in a positive way. 'Rewind The Film' was a harrowing 45-year-old <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> lyrically. 'Futurology' was very much an album of ideas.

2500|$|One form of unspoken {{communication}} between drivers is to flash headlights {{on or off}} once or twice to indicate that a passing truck has cleared the passed vehicle and may safely change lanes {{in front of the}} signaling vehicle. [...] Flashing of the high beams is discouraged since the driver is <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to see if it is clear to move over and the bright light of the high beams can temporarily blind the driver. [...] The passing driver may then flash the trailer or marker lights to indicate thanks. This signal is also sometimes used by other motorists to signal truck drivers.|$|E

His father, a boxer, started his training at the local YMCA. He grew up in a rough area, white in a black neighborhood, surviving numerous death threats, but remained focused. Attending East New York Technical High School from aged 13–16, he [...] "packed three inches onto his arms, netting 16 inches total at a bodyweight of 175 pounds." [...] After graduating high school he worked for Olympic Radio and TV. There he met Joe Abbenda who became his mentor, along with Bill Pearl, advancing his training sessions to 5 days a week.|$|E

2500|$|At the Pawn shop, Gold is <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{and sees}} his hair {{as he prepares}} to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace.

When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab and Jekyll is left unconscious, but the ambush does leave a splatter of the serum, prompting Gold to steal Jekyll’s heart, then pours the serum onto his dagger that will be useful in killing Hyde. [...] As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll’s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to hear about it. [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E

60|$|He {{was about}} sixteen, well set up, with a pleasant, merry, {{freckled}} face, {{and a pair}} of dancing eyes. There was an air at once deprecatory and insinuating about the rascal that I thought I recognised. There came to me from my own boyhood memories of certain passionate admirations long passed away, and the objects of them long ago discredited or dead.
