40|$|In this {{contribution}} it {{is argued}} that vision systems urgently require an open camera to <b>lens</b> communication <b>standard.</b> Traditional machine vision systems are built out of components that are manufactured by different vendors. New lens mounts with an open camera to <b>lens</b> communication <b>standard</b> would also allow machine vision systems to incorporate features that are already common in commercial products. This includes the automatic correction of various types of lens aberrations, including geometric distortion, lateral chromatic aberration, and lens shading. The lack of an open camera to <b>lens</b> communication <b>standard</b> is, however, an even more serious obstacle because modern techniques of computational imaging cannot find wide-spread application in machine vision systems. An open camera to <b>lens</b> communication <b>standard</b> opens up wide-range application to all kinds of computational imaging systems and the machine vision industry is well advised to implement such a standard...|$|R

50|$|Polycarbonate {{is lighter}} weight than normal plastic. It blocks UV rays, is shatter {{resistant}} {{and is used}} in sports glasses and glasses for children and teenagers. Because polycarbonate is soft and will scratch easily, scratch resistant coating is typically applied after shaping and polishing the <b>lens.</b> <b>Standard</b> polycarbonate with an Abbe value of 30 {{is one of the}} worst materials optically, if chromatic aberration intolerance is of concern. Along with Trivex and the high-index plastics, polycarbonate is an excellent choice for rimless eyeglasses. Similar to the high-index plastics, polycarbonate has a very low Abbe value, which may be bothersome to individuals sensitive to chromatic aberrations.|$|E
5000|$|The Sinar F and F1 {{models have}} a clip-on front {{standard}} (<b>lens</b> <b>standard)</b> {{that does not}} fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily {{be removed from the}} rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail clamping mechanism is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. [...] The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the rear rail clamp on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there had}} been {{speculation}} in the trade press over a future Super Rolleiflex for some time, {{it was not until}} 1966 that the SL66 finally appeared, SL being an abbreviation for single lens. It was a sophisticated system camera, a camera at the heart of an extensive range of interchangeable components. The SL66 had built-in bellows, as well as a pivoting front (<b>lens)</b> <b>standard</b> that could be tilted back and forth by 8°, thus allowing the region of sharpness to be manipulated according to the Scheimpflug principle. In addition, the lens could be mounted in reverse, thereby enabling macrophotography without additional equipment. With the normal lens reversed and the bellows extended by 50 mm, close-up photography with a magnification ratio of 1.5× was possible. An SL66 fitted with a normal lens (f/2.8, 80mm) cost 2,778 DM, and several interchangeable lenses were available: ...|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{the image}} circle of a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> usually just covers the image frame,a lens that {{provides}} tilt or shift must allow for {{displacement of the}} lens axis {{from the center of}} the image frame, and consequently requires a larger image circle than a <b>standard</b> <b>lens</b> of the same focal length.|$|R

50|$|The axis of {{the lens}} is {{normally}} perpendicular to the film (or sensor). Changing the angle between axis and film by tilting the <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> backwards or forwards is called lens tilt, or just tilt. Tilt is especially useful in landscape photography. By using the Scheimpflug principle, the “plane of sharp focus” can be changed so that any plane can be brought into sharp focus. When the film plane and lens plane are parallel {{as is the case}} for most 35 mm cameras, the plane of sharp focus is also parallel to these two planes. If, however, the lens plane is tilted with respect to the film plane, the plane of sharp focus is also tilted according to geometrical and optical properties. The three planes intersect in a line below the camera for downward lens tilt. The tilted plane of sharp focus is useful, in that this plane can be made to coincide with a near and far object. Thus, both near and far objects on the plane are in focus.|$|E

40|$|Keith Raymond Pine, 1 Brian Sloan, 2 Robert John Jacobs 11 Department of Optometry and Vision Science, 2 New Zealand National Eye Centre, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New ZealandBackground: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} deposit buildup on prosthetic eyes and the implications for conjunctival inflammation and discharge. Methods: Forty-three prosthetic eye wearers participated in the study. Twenty-three had their prostheses polished normally before being worn continuously for 2 weeks. After this time, surface deposits were stained, photographed, and graded. The prostheses were then repolished to optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> and worn for a further 2 weeks, when the deposits were again stained, photographed, and graded. Two participants had deposits on their prostheses stained, photographed, and graded on nine occasions at decreasing intervals ranging from 1 year to 1 day. Eighteen participants had the wetting angles on their prostheses measured with a goniometer before and after cleaning, after polishing normally, after polishing to optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard,</b> and after 10 minutes of wearing their optical quality contact lens polished prostheses. Concordance correlation, multiple regression, and paired t-tests were used for the statistical analysis. Results: More surface deposits accumulated on prostheses polished normally than on those polished to an optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> after 2 weeks of wear. The interpalpebral zone of most prostheses (observed without magnification) appeared to be clear of deposits. Removal of deposits significantly decreased surface wettability, but wettability returned after 10 minutes of wear. Optical quality contact lens polishing produced more wettable surfaces and a slower rate of deposit accumulation than normal polishing. Conclusion: We recommend that an optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> be the minimum standard of finish for prosthetic eyes. This standard may assist the smooth action of the lids over the interpalpebral zone of the prosthesis and the cleansing action of tears. The presence of deposits in the retropalpebral zone may improve the lubricating properties of socket fluids which, in turn, may result in less frictional irritation of the conjunctiva and less mucoid discharge.

Methods: Sample disks (12 mm diameter &times; 1 mm thickness) of PMMA were polished to three different standards of surface finish: low, normal, and optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard.</b> The sample disks were incubated in a protein-rich artificial tear solution (ATS) for the following periods of time: 1 second, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 14 days. Surface wettability was measured with a goniometer before and after protein deposits were removed. One-way analysis of variance and paired-samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Results: Between 13. 64 and 62. 88 &micro;g of protein adhered to the sample disks immediately upon immersion in ATS. Sample disks with the highest polish attracted less protein deposits. The sample disks polished to optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> were more wettable than those less highly polished, and wettability significantly decreased following removal of protein deposits. The addition of lipids to protein-only ATS made no difference to the amount of protein deposited on the sample disks for any of the standards of surface polish tested. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with the results of the in-vivo investigation reported previously by the authors. Our view that the minimum standard of polish for prosthetic eyes should be optical quality contact <b>lens</b> <b>standard</b> and that deposits on PMMA prosthetic eyes improve the lubricating properties of the socket fluids has been reinforced by the results of this study.
