In this paper we present preliminary results obtained with a novel approach that combines well established kernel text classifiers with external contextual commonsense knowledge. We propose a method for computing semantic similarity between words as a result of diffusion process in ConceptNet semantic space. Evaluation on a Reuters dataset show an improvement in precision of classification. ...|$|R
