40|$|The {{concept of}} Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) in {{internal}} combustion engines has shown to yield high gross indicated efficiencies, {{but at the}} expense of gas exchange efficiencies. Most of the experimental research on partially premixed combustion has been conducted on compression ignition engines designed to operate on diesel fuel and relatively high exhaust temperatures. The partially premixed combustion concept on the other hand relies on dilution with high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates to slow down the combustion which results in low exhaust temperatures, but also high mass flows over cylinder, valves, ports and manifolds. A careful design of the gas exchange system, EGR arrangement and heat exchangers is therefore of utter importance. Experiments were performed on a heavy-duty, compression ignition engine using a fuel consisting of 80 volume % 95 RON service station gasoline and 20 volume % n-heptane. A wide range of engine speeds and loads were run using a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> system. The experiments served as a validation basis for a one-dimensional simulation model. Using the model, a comparison between <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR,</b> high pressure EGR and combined low and high pressure EGR was performed. The results showed that the combined low and high pressure EGR configuration could reach an average brake efficiency of 41. 6 % while the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> and high pressure EGR reached 39. 5 % and 39. 9 % respectively. The combined configuration reached a higher efficiency because it decreased the mass flow range in which the turbine and compressor needed to work which resulted in a higher overall turbocharger efficiency. The effect of varying the EGR and charge air cooler gas outlet temperatures was also studied. It was concluded that a higher cooler temperature decreased both the brake efficiency and the maximum achievable load due to a higher in-cylinder heat transfer loss...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a control design using dual-loop {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) and variable geometry turbo charging (VGT), installed on a medium-duty, V 8 diesel engine, to adjust intake temperature, pressure, and oxygen mass fraction. The dual-loop EGR system is compiled of both high pressure EGR (HPEGR) and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> (LPEGR) paths. Turbocharging is achieved {{through the use of}} a two-stage system consisting of a fixed geometry, low pressure turbo and a variable geometry, high pressure turbo.

The effects of various EGR amounts are investigated in terms of fuel consumption at full load operations. The proposed results highlight that EGR allows for increasing the knock safety margin. Fuel economy improvements however depend on the overall engine recalibration, consisting in proper settings of the A/F ratio and spark advance, compatible with knock occurrence. The numerical recalibration also accounts for additional limitations on the turbocharger speed, boost level, and turbine inlet temperature.

40|$|To {{comply with}} Stage IV {{emission}} standard for off-road engines, Kohler Engines has developed the 100 kW rated KDI 3. 4 liters diesel engine, equipped with DOC and SCR. Based on this engine, {{a research project}} in collaboration between Kohler Engines, Ricardo, Denso and Politecnico di Torino was carried out to exploit the potential of new technologies to meet the Stage IV and beyond emission standards. The prototype engine was equipped with a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> cooled <b>EGR</b> system, two stage turbocharger, high pressure fuel injection system capable of very high injection pressure and DOC+DPF aftertreatment system. Since the Stage IV emission standard sets a 0. 4 g/kWh NOx limit for the steady state test cycle (NRSC), that includes full load operating conditions, the engine must be operated with very high EGR rates (above 30 %) at very high load. As a consequence, the low {{air to fuel ratio}} and the risk of high soot emissions must be handled by means of high fuel injection pressure and proper injection patterns. In this context, the DIPulse multizone predictive combustion model developed by Gamma Technologies was extensively employed to support the engine calibration and the hardware selection processes. After populating the injection rate map starting from a limited set of measurements, the model was then calibrated to simulate the combustion process with extremely high injection <b>pressures</b> and <b>EGR</b> rates, achieving a very good correlation with the experimental data in terms of burn rates, engine performance parameters and NOx emissions. In this way a kind of "virtual test rig" was obtained, on which the effects of different injection patterns and hardware components could be analyzed, thus significantly shortening the hardware selection and calibration activities on the test bench to achieve the project targets...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{how high}} levels of exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) combined with certain fuel injection strategies and energy recovery systems affect diesel engine emissions and fuel economy. The key test apparatus was a John Deere 4. 5 L diesel engine which was modeled using the computer-based engine simulation tool GT-Power. The conclusion was made that utilization of high EGR levels (30 % and above) can enable a diesel engine operating at low-load/low-speed conditions to meet Tier 4 emissions regulations {{without the use of}} NOx after-treatment, but that employment of such EGR levels will likely make necessary the use of soot after-treatment. Results found that using a single, late injection produced the lowest brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for high EGR operation conditions. Results also found that, among varying EGR levels and injection strategies tested, the combination of 30 % or more EGR with a double injection produced the lowest levels for NOx and soot emissions combined, but at the cost of increased BSFC. This study also performed a numerical analysis on certain designs of energy recovery systems used to generate mechanical power from exhaust gas heat. Two Brayton cycle systems were tested, but a Rankine cycle system, also tested, proved to generate more power. A numerical study was performed on this Rankine cycle energy recovery system integrated into the John Deere engine, in which this engine was operated with 30 % EGR, varying load/speed conditions, and either a <b>low</b> or high <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> loop.

Following the development of a prototype cooled LP EGR circuit, the main engine and turbocharger parameters were measured in six part-load operating conditions related to the European driving cycles. Different operating modes were considered, from the simplest and most commonly investigated (without EGR, with HP or LP EGR) to more complex schemes, namely the simultaneous application of high and low pressure recirculation and the addition of variable nozzle turbine (VNT) control. The extensive experimental database made it possible to confirm literature concerning the comparison of recirculating systems and the potential of LP EGR on engine intake temperature and NOx reductions. New aspects were also analysed, such as the balance of the high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> rate in order to achieve maximum NOx reductions in simultaneous applications, the interactions between EGR circuit management and the application of VNT control in order to improve the trade-off between fuel consumption and NOx and soot emissions...|$|E

Within {{a project in}} collaboration between Kohler Engines EMEA, Politecnico di Torino, Ricardo and Denso to exploit the potential of EGR-Only technologies, a 3. 4 liters KDI 3404 was equipped with a two stage turbocharging system, an extremely high pressure FIS and a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> system. The LP-EGR system works in a closed loop control with an intake oxygen sensor actuating two valves: an EGR valve placed downstream of the EGR cooler that regulates the flow area of the bypass between the exhaust line and the intake line, and an exhaust flap to generate enough backpressure to recirculate the needed EGR rate to cut the NOx emission without a specific aftertreatment device. In this paper it will be demonstrated how, using a 1 D-CFD code to characterize the flow in the exhaust line and in the EGR pathway, together with simple physical correlations, {{it is possible to}} define the opening laws of the two valves in order to both obtain a linear response of the EGR control and minimize the fuel consumption increase due to the backpressure valve...|$|E

The activation of low pressure loop confirmed to be beneficial for turbocharger performance, rising its rotational speed thus granting for a better transient response, while increase in soot emissions ranged in a wide interval.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{achieving}} a fast warm {{up of the}} exhaust system has raised {{in the recent years}} a growing interest in the adoption of Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) technology for automotive diesel engines. As a matter of fact, different measures can be adopted through VVA to accelerate the warm up of the exhaust system, such as using hot internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (iEGR) to heat the intake charge, especially at part load, or adopting early Exhaust Valve Opening (eEVO) timing during the expansion stroke, so to increase the exhaust gas temperature during blowdown. In this paper a simulation study is presented evaluating the impact of VVA on the exhaust temperature of a modern light duty 4 -cylinder diesel engine, 1. 6 liters, equipped with a Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT). Numerical simulations were carried out by means of a commercially available 1 D-CFD software (GT-SUITE) and a predictive combustion model (DIPulse) was adopted in order to properly evaluate the impact of different VVA strategies on the combustion process. The analysis was focused on the assessment of the potential of 3 different VVA strategies for managing the exhaust temperature: Early Exhaust Valve Opening (EEVO), obtained by means of valve lift modifications, Exhaust Phasing, by changing the valve timing, and Exhaust Valve ReOpening (EVrO) during the intake stroke for iEGR. Moreover, for the EVrO strategy, two different EGR combinations (iEGR-only and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> with iEGR, respectively) were evaluated to identify the best trade-off between the exhaust temperature increase and the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) penalty. Thanks to the abovementioned VVA strategies, in steady state conditions increases in the exhaust temperature up to 70 K with BSFC penalties below 8 % at low engine loads were achieved. Finally, the impact of VVA strategies was evaluated under transient conditions over the WLTC (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle), highlighting a temperature increase of 30 K of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst after the first 300 s with a total fuel consumption penalty lower than 1 %...|$|E
40|$|Exhaust Gas Recirculation {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} engines to reduce NOx formation and part-load throttle loss for many years. More recently, there is a trend towards down-sizing and turbocharging engines as the strategy helps to improve fuel economy. Cooled <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> complements down-sizing-turbocharging in direct injection gasoline engines and has the potential to further improve efficiency. When exhaust gas gets cooled down below its dew point in an EGR cooler, the contained water vapor condenses on the cooler walls and dissolves some of the exhaust gases, which may make the condensate corrosive. For this reason, the extraction point for EGR is usually located downstream of the catalyst, where the gas that condenses with water has substantial amount of ammonia, making the condensate slightly basic but not corrosive. Following a recent study which showed potential fuel economy benefits of locating the EGR extraction point upstream of the catalyst, an understanding of the chemistry of pre-catalyst condensate is required. The feed gas to the catalyst contains NO, and other gases, which dissolve in the condensate to form acids. This study attempts to quantify the contribution of NOx, SOx and CO 2 in the exhaust towards acid formation, in order to identify the cause of the acidity under different engine operating conditions. Theoretical calculations were done to predict the condensate pH for different air-fuel ratios and combustion phasing, for each gas separately and then together, assuming equilibrium between exhaust gas and condensate. Condensate pH was also measured experimentally for these running conditions to attempt to verify the calculations. Calculations show that the pH varies in the range 2 to 4. Contribution from SO, is the determining factor during rich operation; that from NO, is more important at stoichiometric and lean conditions. Actual pH values are generally less acidic than the calculated values and vary between 3 and 6. This discrepancy indicates that the dissolving of these gases into the condensate does not reach equilibrium. However, the calculated values may serve as useful bounds on the condensate pH. by Lakshya Jain. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade diesel {{combustion}} has developed in a new direction. Research {{has been carried out}} trying to prolong the ignition delay and enhance fuel/air premixing to avoid diffusion combustion as well as lowering the combustion temperature through use of EGR. One of these new combustion concepts is Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC). PPC is aimed to provide combustion with low smoke and NOx without sacrificing fuel consumption. This thesis presents the development of a multi-cylinder PPC concept. It reaches from the basic characterization of this new combustion strategy to the demands on hardware, control and fuels for a realizable PPC solution. In summary it contains a thorough PPC characterization where the results suggest that high EGR, early injection PPC strategies are to prefer over late injection approaches or smokeless rich diesel combustion. Further, a strong connection between mixing period, defined as the period between end of injection and start of combustion, and PPC has been ascertained. Based on this knowledge a combustion controller with feedback control of mixing period was derived. The operating range of multi-cylinder diesel PPC was then evaluated. The study showed that the PPC load range was limited covering only 25 % of the operating region for conventional combustion. In order to reach higher loads for PPC the EGR system was rebuilt to a low pressure system. This system improves EGR/air mixing and cooling and enables high EGR and boost pressure simultaneously. Additionally, gasoline fuels were introduced to extend the ignition delay and mitigate soot formation. An extensive fuel comparison was carried out to find the most suitable fuel for PPC operation. With the improved set-up the operating range was reevaluated. By combining the use of a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>EGR</b> system and standard gasoline the operating region of PPC has been extended to cover 50 % of the engine nominal operating region. The final part of this thesis is dedicated to a novel method of cylinder individual efficiency estimation based on the cylinder pressure trace. With this method, control strategies aiming directly at fuel consumption optimization can be developed. An extremum seeking control algorithm was applied. The results show that the controller manages to find the maximum brake torque region both with and without external excitation. Finally, the estimation error in accumulated fuel consumption from the experiments is around 1 % which shows the potential of using the absolute value of the efficiency estimation in other control concepts...|$|E

In this case there appeared to be little hydrogen adsorption and the minimum temperature for monocrystalline growth was not affected by pressure. However the occurence of parasitic decomposition in the gas phase was pressure dependent and has been virtually eliminated by the use of <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> The higher gas speeds which result from the use of a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> have allowed us to achieve very abrupt heterointerfaces, for example at the GaInAs/InP heterointerface grown by <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> OM VPE a locallised electron gas exhibiting two dimensional properties has been measured...|$|R

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} offers good fuel economy and generates low carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, {{but it is}} also a source of undesirably high {{particulate}} matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which are subject to increasingly strict legislative limits because of their adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, in recent years, several combustion concepts have been developed to meet future legislation requirements, one of which is Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) using high levels of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recycling). In order to investigate the possibilities for using low temperature combustion to reduce undesirable emissions, investigations were performed using a single-cylinder research engine. The goal was to find a suitable combination of operational parameters at which both NOx and soot engine-out emissions are minimized, with a minimal fuel consumption penalty. When increasing EGR from low levels to levels corresponding to LTC, soot emissions first start to increase (due to reductions in soot oxidation), before decreasing to almost zero (due to very low rates of soot formation). At the EGR level where soot emissions start to increase, the NOx emissions are low, but not low enough to comply with future emission standards. However, emissions of both soot and NOx can be reduced to low levels with LTC obtained using high levels of EGR (approximately 60 %). Unfortunately, low temperature combustion is accompanied by increases in fuel consumption and emissions of hydrocarbons (HCs) and CO, but these drawbacks can be reduced by advancing the injection timing. The results also show that high charge air <b>pressure,</b> <b>low</b> <b>EGR</b> temperature and high injection pressure are important parameters for achieving low engine-out emissions. Very low soot emissions can be obtained at intermediate EGR levels without increased CO and HC emissions, but the NOx emissions remain too high and need to be further reduced in order to comply with future emission standards. Using high EGR levels, NOx and soot emissions can meet future emission standards, but the fuel consumption penalty associated with the high CO and HC emissions needs to be reduced...|$|R

With the good physical property of high specific heat, <b>low</b> vapor <b>pressure,</b> <b>low</b> thermal decomposition rate and so on, the glycerol, hydrogenated terphenyls and water of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> are widely used in the accelerate driven sub-critical reactor as the secondary coolant. Compare the three coolant by the aspect of heat economy and engineering safety, we conclude that, compared with the glycerol and the hydrogenated terphenyls, water of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> has the best heat economy, {{at the same time it}} has the <b>lowest</b> <b>pressure</b> drop and the highest coefficient of heat transfer in the heat exchange tube. Therefore, choose water in <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> as the secondary coolant in sub-critical reactor can decrease the heat exchange area to a large extent, together with the advantage of economy and safe...|$|R
