5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum <b>legal</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight.</b> This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum <b>legal</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E

40|$|A {{project was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the impact of four different weighing methods on over/under load of forestry trucks operating in Forestry Corporation of New South Wales (FCNSW) under two types of roads; gazetted (approved for higher <b>legal</b> <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weight</b> limits) and non-gazetted (standard public road <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weight</b> limits). For all the technologies tested there {{was found to be}} a substantial under-loading issue ranging from 5. 3 to 6. 4 tonnes per load on gazetted roads while the same technology achieved a much better outcome on non-gazetted with a range of 1. 4 tonnes under-loaded to 0. 1 tonnes over-loaded on average. The results point to a more significant role for policy and methods than the technology used for in-forest weighing in achieving effective payload management in forestry haulage...|$|R
500|$|Penalties {{for violating}} weight limits vary between states (bridge formula weight {{violations}} {{are treated as}} <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> violations), as the states are responsible for enforcement and collection of fines. Some states, such as Connecticut, issue fines on a percentage basis (e.g. 20% overweight at $10 per [...] ), which means larger trucks pay higher fines. For example, a truck with a <b>legal</b> <b>gross</b> limit of [...] that violates the limit by [...] would pay a fine of $500, while a truck with a <b>legal</b> <b>gross</b> limit of [...] that violates the limit by 5,000pounds would pay a fine of $250. Other states, such as New York, issue fines on a per-pound basis (e.g., 5,000pounds overweight equals a $300 fine). Others, such as Massachusetts, impose a less complicated fine schedule whereby a vehicle that violates the limits by less than [...] is fined $40 per , while a violation over [...] pays $80 per [...] (e.g. [...] overweight equals a $200 fine).|$|R
