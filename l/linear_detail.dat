50|$|Although {{it allowed}} fine <b>linear</b> <b>detail,</b> subtle tonal {{transition}} {{and at times}} vivid colourisation, {{by the end of}} the 15th century the medium, along with egg tempera, had fallen out of favour. Oil painting had become predominant among the artists of the early Northern Renaissance, mainly due to the innovations in oil by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. It can be viewed as a transitional method between works in tempera or oils on wooden panels and oil paintings on canvas, although tüchlein co-existed with panel painting until both were supplanted by oil-on-canvas {{by the end of the}} 16th century. The technique corresponds with the Spanish sarga, where a thin gesso ground was favoured to create a smooth working surface.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{multiscale}} geometric analysis tool nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT), {{this study}} proposed a novel medical image fusion method. In the high-frequency part, after the NSCT decomposition, this algorithm used the Beamlet transform to detect edge. Then it formulated the high-frequency coefficients fusion rules {{according to the}} difference of the clustering segmentation edge density. In the low-frequency part, this algorithm adopted the local area standard deviation coefficients fusion rules. After the consistency correction, this algorithm got the reconstructed image by the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) inverse transform on the high-frequency and low-frequency coefficients. The experiment results show that this algorithm can effectively reduce the interference of the noise on the fused image, advance the fused image <b>linear</b> <b>detail</b> expressive capability and improve the amount of information...|$|E

40|$|I aim {{to depict}} {{alternate}} realities built by human error and misunderstanding as {{they apply to}} the natural world and natural systems. They are alternate realities informed by (mis) observation; both my own and that of others; individual figures both historical and fictitious {{that in some way}} embody the desire (and often failure) to shape and understand the world around them. These figures are in many ways stand-ins for myself, as well as my own artistic practice, and in telling their stories I seek to illuminate failure, futility, and imperfection, in their most poignant, beautiful, and absurd expression. Borrowing specific and obscure instances in human and natural history and themes from science, literature and myth, I strive to reproduce these mutable realities as narrative etchings and drawings, which combine visual clarity and readability with a high density of minute <b>linear</b> <b>detail.</b> Drawing is a form of translation and a form of labor, a means of synthesizing numerous, seemingly disparate topics.

40|$|Vector is a {{group of}} four un-identical vessels, with common {{features}} placed on a shared platform. Similarities in shape, size, method of construction and decorative detail serve to identify the vessels as a set. Three are made in silver and a fourth (a rogue, opposite or negative object) is made in darkened non-precious metal. The visual appearance of the vessels relates to the processes used to develop the design. The starting point, a digital, technical drawing of a conical form of pre-determined size and shape was developed to produce a paper pattern, which was subsequently used to generate sketch models in card. Many models were made, considered, adjusted and re-made until a suitable group emerged. The final set exploits the qualities of the initial line drawings as decorative detail, which is echoed in the <b>linear</b> <b>detail</b> seen {{on the surface of the}} platform on which the objects sit. The platform colour references paper and the technical drawing roots of the piece. Lines engraved on the surface of the platform are filled with pencil lead filings, a further allusion to drawing as well as indication as to where the objects should be placed. Vector seeks to capture the connection between the maker's mind’s eye image, the design process and methods of sheet metalwork construction.   Vector was exhibited as part of Silver Speaks: ‘Form’, an exhibition of work by members of Contemporary British Silversmiths, which ran from 1 st June – 23 rd September 2016 at the Goldsmiths’ Centre. The exhibition provided an insight into the processes behind the making of objects and what is used to create them. It showcased 33 works alongside the makers’ tools, original samples and drawings.

In this study, we present the advantage of DWT to improve time series forecasting precision. This article suggests a novel technique of forecasting by segregating a time series dataset into linear and nonlinear components through DWT. At first, DWT is used to decompose the in-sample training dataset of the time series into <b>linear</b> (<b>detailed)</b> and non-linear (approximate) parts. Then, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are used to separately recognize and predict the reconstructed detailed and approximate components, respectively. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically utilizes the unique strengths of DWT, ARIMA, and ANN to improve the forecasting accuracy. Our hybrid method is tested on four real-world time series and its forecasting results are compared with those of ARIMA, ANN, and Zhang's hybrid models. Results clearly show that the proposed method achieves best forecasting accuracies for each series...|$|R

Both the fact that it is close to us and that it is seen edge-on allow {{detailed}} analysis of the interaction of the newly formed stars in the Orion Nebula with the molecular cloud. Previous data sets from this region have provided a great deal of indirect evidence for a structure of low and high density 'clumps' on small scales (~ 0. 1 pc). A clumpy structure for the Bar is required in order to explain both the spatial extent of emission from molecular species, for example H 2, and observed line ratios such as the CO 7 - 6 / 14 - 13 ratio. Our observations use the strong density dependence of the ratio of the 1 - 0 S(1) and 2 - 1 S(1) lines of molecular hydrogen to explore the physical structure of the Bar. Images taken with the infrared camera, IRCAM 3, on UKIRT show <b>linear</b> <b>details</b> to scales of ~ 0. 5 arcsecs extending over tens of arcseconds into the molecular cloud. The ratio of the line strengths from the two images allows the high density 'clumps' or filaments and the lower density 'inter-clump' medium to be identified.
