5000|$|The [...] "loudness" [...] {{control on}} some {{consumer}} stereos alters the frequency response curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness {{characteristic of the}} ear. <b>Loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> is {{difficult}} to implement, since the audio level at a listener's ears depends on speaker sensitivity as well as amplifier gain. Loudness controls are rarely present on modern equipment, although such controls were common on 70s and 80s amplifiers. One reason for its apparent popularity could be that older speakers needed a boost in bass and the high frequencies to balance losses in the speakers, and sometimes the media itself.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> to work {{correctly}} the playback {{system must}} accurately assume what volume level {{was used in}} the mastering location. Fortunately, for movie soundtracks this reference volume level is an industry standard and can be used by manufacturers to provide a loudness feature that works with a reasonable degree of accuracy. A Home theater product that provides a reference level indication on the volume control can be expected to work well with movie soundtracks.|$|E
50|$|The smiley face {{curve is}} roughly {{analogous}} to the frequency response of human hearing as charted in the equal-loudness contour, and {{has been compared to}} <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> circuitry in that it increases the relative power of high and low frequencies without increasing the midrange power. In order for a sound system to be heard properly by humans, it should have an equal-loudness contour applied to it when it is performing at low sound pressure levels, then the curve should gradually flatten out as it gets louder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> is {{a setting}} found on some hi-fi {{equipment}} and equalisers {{that increases the}} level of the high and low frequencies. This is intended to be used at low listening levels, to compensate for the fact that as the volume of audio decreases, the ear's lower sensitivity to extreme high and low frequencies may cause these signals to fall below threshold.As a result audio material may seem to become 'thin' sounding at low volumes, losing bass and treble, the 'Loudness compensation' button (often just labelled 'Loudness' or 'Loud') is intended to rectify this situation. See the section on Loudness for a more detailed explanation of the ears' sensitivity to sound as a function of frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{incorporation}} of (switchable) level compression in domestic music systems and car in-car systems would allow higher quality on systems capable of {{wide dynamic range}} and in situations that allowed realistic reproduction. Such compression systems have been suggested and tried from time to time, but are not in widespread use — a 'chicken and egg' problem since producers feel they must make programmes and recordings that sound good in car with high ambient noise or on cheap low-power music systems. In the UK, some DAB receivers do incorporate a menu setting for automatic <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> which adds extra gain on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4, {{to allow for the}} fact that these programmes adopt lower levels than, for example, the pop station Radio 1. Some television receivers also have a menu setting for loudness normalisation, aimed at helping to reduce excessive loudness on advertisements. However, there is no common agreement to reduce compression and limiting and leave these tasks to the receiver.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a hearing aid}} concept with {{recruitment}} of <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> and acoustic feedback cancellation is presented. Special consideration {{is given to the}} acoustic feedback canceler which uses only the available (e. g. speech) input signal for adaptation. In principle, the feedback canceler is adapted to the feedback path in the transform domain using a power-normalized least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The transformation into uniform subbands is based on an augmentation of the modulated lapped transform (MLT). Together with the hearing-loss compensating forward filter the proposed feedback canceler is computationally very efficient...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{listening}} tests performed {{to investigate the}} just audible tonality (JAT) of decaying pure tone bursts. Both exponential and Gaussian functions are used to shape the envelopes of the tone bursts and critical band center frequencies between 150 and 7000 Hz are studied. <b>Loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> is implemented {{to compensate for the}} reduced loudness of short tone bursts and attack functions are used for minimizing clicks. By using the method of limits, a sequence of tone bursts with increasing decay times and constant frequencies is presented to the listeners at 0. 9 s intervals. The first burst in the sequence which is perceived as being tonal is indicated by the listeners. When that happens, the decay times of the tone bursts decrease and the listeners are asked to select the first tone burst with no audible tonality. The listeners are allowed to freely define tonality. No reference is given. For frequencies above 3. 4 kHz, the results indicate that tonality is just audible for tone burst lengths of approximately 2. 6 – 3. 0 ms. For the lowest stimuli frequencies, the corresponding burst length is approximately 20 – 23 ms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the optimization of the nonlinear component of a physiologically motivated feature extraction system for automatic speech recognition. Most computational models of the peripheral auditory system include a sigmoidal nonlinear function that relates the log of signal intensity to output level, which we represent {{by a set of}} frequency dependent logistic functions. The parameters of these rate-level functions are estimated to maximize the a posteriori probability of the correct class in training data. The performance of this approach was verified by the results of a series of experiments conducted with the CMU S phinx-III speech recognition system on the DARPA Resource Management, Wall Street Journal databases, and on the AURORA 2 database. In general, it was shown that feature extraction that incorporates the learned rate-nonlinearity, combined with a complementary <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation</b> function, results in better recognition accuracy in the presence of background noise than traditional MFCC feature extraction without the optimized nonlinearity when the system is trained on clean speech and tested in noise. We also describe the use of lattice structure that constraints the training process, enabling training with much more complicated acoustic models.

40|$|Single-channel {{modulation}} detection thresholds (MDTs) {{have been}} shown to predict cochlear implant (CI) users ’ speech performance. However, little is known about multi-channel modulation sensitivity. Two factors likely contribute to multichannel modulation sensitivity: multichannel loudness summation and the across-site variance in single-channel MDTs. In this study, single- and multi-channel MDTs were measured in 9 CI users at relatively low and high presentation levels and modulation frequencies. Single-channel MDTs were measured at widely spaced electrode locations, and these same channels were used for the multichannel stimuli. Multichannel MDTs were measured twice, with and without adjustment for multichannel loudness summation (i. e., at the same loudness as for the single-channel MDTs or louder). Results showed that the effect of presentation level and modulation frequency were similar for single- and multi-channel MDTs. Multichannel MDTs were significantly poorer than single-channel MDTs when the current levels of the multichannel stimuli were reduced to match the loudness of the single-channel stimuli. This suggests that, at equal loudness, single-channel measures may over-estimate CI users ’ multichannel modulation sensitivity. At equal loudness, there was no significant correlation between the amount of multichannel loudness summation and the deficit in multichannel MDTs, relative to the average single-channel MDT. With no <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation,</b> multichannel MDTs were significantly better than the best single-channel MDT. The across-site variance in single-channel MDTs varied substantially across subjects. However, the across-site varianc...|$|E
40|$|Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} {{typically}} {{results in a}} steepened loudness function and a reduced dynamic range from elevated thresholds to uncomfortably loud levels for narrowband and broadband signals. Restoring narrowband loudness perception for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners can lead to overly loud perception of broadband signals and {{it is unclear how}} binaural presentation affects loudness perception in this case. Here, loudness perception quantified by categorical loudness scaling for nine normal-hearing (NH) and ten HI listeners was compared for signals with different bandwidth and different spectral shape in monaural and in binaural conditions. For the HI listeners, frequency- and level-dependent amplification was used to match the narrowband monaural loudness functions of the NH listeners. The average loudness functions for NH and HI listeners showed good agreement for monaural broadband signals. However, HI listeners showed substantially greater loudness for binaural broadband signals than NH listeners: on average a 14. 1 dB lower level was required to reach “very loud” (range 30. 8 to − 3. 7 dB). Overall, with narrowband <b>loudness</b> <b>compensation,</b> a given binaural loudness for broadband signals above “medium loud” was reached at systematically lower levels for HI than for NH listeners. Such increased binaural loudness summation was not found for loudness categories below “medium loud” or for narrowband signals. Large individual variations in the increased loudness summation were observed and could not be explained by the audiogram or the narrowband loudness functions...|$|E
