5|$|Frank McGee {{came from}} a {{prominent}} Canadian family. His late uncle, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, had been a Father of Confederation. His father, John Joseph McGee, was clerk of the Privy Council (considered the top civil servant position). Frank was one of nine children born to John Joseph McGee and Elizabeth Crotty. Frank had five brothers and three sisters: Thomas D'Arcy, Jim, John, Walter, Charles, Katharine, Mary and Lillian. His brother Jim was also a noted athlete in football and ice hockey before dying in a horse-riding accident in May 1904. Charles, <b>like</b> <b>Frank,</b> also died in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The murder notes {{had been}} {{analyzed}} before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous {{evidence at the}} commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written {{in the third person}} rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager <b>like</b> <b>Frank.</b>|$|E

5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E
5|$|Scott had {{discussed}} the script with Crowe {{as they worked}} on A Good Year in France, and they sought {{to take on the}} project. The director reviewed Zaillian's script, Terry George's rewrite, and a revision by Richard Price during the project's incarnation with director Antoine Fuqua. Scott preferred Zaillian's approach and chose to follow it. In realizing the project, the director encountered a challenge in the script since the characters Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes {{before the end of the}} film. The director sought to flesh out the private universes of the characters that would evolve and have scenes cut between the two characters to provide a balance. Elements <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Lucas's interaction with his family and Richie Roberts' dysfunctional marriage were written to add to the characters' backgrounds. The rappers T.I., RZA and Common were added to the cast to appeal to younger audiences.|$|E

25|$|The edited {{broadcast}} of December 3 – combining the big, choreographed numbers, lavish sets {{and some of}} the informal live sessions – was an enormous success.

25|$|While the King's Gambit Accepted was {{a staple}} of Romantic era chess, the opening began to decline {{with the rise of}} {{positional}} play in the 1870s, although King's Gambit Declined variants remained popular among high-level players until World War I. By the 1920s, 1.e4 openings fell into disrepute and were ridiculed by hypermodern players such as Richard Reti and Aron Nimzovitch, and players <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Marshall and Jose Raul Capablanca, who had been known as dashing attackers prior to WWI, largely switched to 1.d4 and 1.c4 openings and positional play.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|Many artists {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s {{opposed the war}} and used their {{creativity}} and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, and Robert Bly. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war {{as well as the}} disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists Ronald Haeberle, Peter Saul, and Nancy Spero, among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as Lenny Lipton, Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> O'Hara, Sam Shepard, Robert Lowell, Megan Terry, Grant Duay, and Kenneth Bernard used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to think more critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular {{in the early years of}} the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.|$|E

25|$|Taking its {{example from}} other European modernists like Joan Miró, the Color Field {{movement}} encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century {{through the early}} 21st century. Color Field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms {{to refer to the}} three separate but related groups are Abstract expressionism, Post-Painterly Abstraction, and Lyrical Abstraction. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color Field pioneers such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell are primarily thought of as Abstract Expressionists. Artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jules Olitski, and Kenneth Noland were of a slightly younger generation {{or in the case of}} Morris Louis esthetically aligned with that generations point of view; that started out as Abstract Expressionists but quickly moved to Post-Painterly Abstraction. While younger artists <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Stella, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Ronnie Landfield, Dan Christensen, began with Post-Painterly Abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as Lyrical Abstraction. Many of the artists mentioned as well as many others have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of Color Field painting; as reflections of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s (in which everything began to hang loose) and the angst of the age (with all of the uncertainties of the time) merged with the gestalt of Post-Painterly Abstraction, producing Lyrical Abstraction which combined precision of the Color Field idiom with the malerische of the Abstract Expressionists. During the same period of the late 1960s early 1970s in Europe, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as Neo-expressionism.|$|E

It was also used in numerous films like The Boy with Green Hair, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and the 2001 musical Moulin Rouge!, for which singer David Bowie recorded a techno version.|$|E

More recent buildings <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand {{out among the}} Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus [...] "starchitecture".

500|$|MacFarlane has a {{baritone}} voice. He is {{a pianist}} and singer who, {{in his early}} years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra.

[...] "They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... show your teeth.

500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|Savige {{joined the}} Militia on 19 February 1920, with his AIF rank of captain. He served with Headquarters 3rdDivision—then under Gellibrand—from July 1921 to November 1924. He {{commanded}} the 37thInfantry Battalion from 1 December 1924 to 31 July 1928, the 24thInfantry Battalion from 1 August 1928 to 31 May 1935, and the 10thInfantry Brigade from 1 June 1935 to 12 October 1939. Along the way, {{he was promoted}} to major on 1 July 1924, lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1926, colonel on 1 June 1935, and brigadier on 1 May 1938. His promotion, while neither meteoric nor exceptional, was still far faster than that enjoyed by regular officers <b>like</b> <b>Frank</b> Berryman, Horace Robertson, or George Alan Vasey, who had been majors in the AIF but remained at that rank for nearly twenty years, only to find themselves junior to Militia officers like Savige. For his part, Savige was a critic of the regulars. While commander of 10thInfantry Brigade, he insisted that Royal Military College, Duntroon graduates serve first as platoon commanders before assuming staff posts, so they could acquire an understanding of the men.
