40|$|AbstractIn highly {{populated}} urban canyons, {{the mobile}} communication signal propagate {{from the base}} station and arrives at the mobile station(or mobile phone) as a multitude of partial waves from different directions. This is known as multipath propagation. This effect gives rise to multipath fading. Due to this, received signal strength decreases and sometimes unable to recognise. So characterisation and modelling of wireless channel is important. The received signal strength in terms of power is measured using RF recorder for analysis at the mobile station at certain time intervals and the signal (in dBm) assumed to be received in multipath environment and is composed of fast fading caused by <b>local</b> <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> and slow fading due to shadowing.

50|$|In {{wireless}} communications, Raleigh {{developed a}} comprehensive and precise channel model {{that works with}} multiple antennas. He employed the model to develop smart antenna signal processing techniques for rapid fading, <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation,</b> and frequency-division duplex environments. As {{a result of this}} research, Raleigh found that <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> could be exploited to greatly increase the capacity of wireless communications, enabling data rates competitive with wire-based networks. In a paper prepared for the 1996 GLOBECOM conference in London, Raleigh presented the first rigorous mathematical proof that in the presence of naturally occurring <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> multiple antennas may be used with special signal processing techniques to transmit multiple data streams at the same time on the same frequency, multiplying the information-carrying capacity (data rate) of wireless links.

40|$|AbstractModern {{industrial}} environments with automated production machinery {{often require}} special indoor positioning and localization techniques, {{due to the}} presence of objects and of the infrastructure that may obstruct the line-of-sight propagation or interfere with the behaviour of electromagnetic waves. These challenges are difficult to overcome by the widely employed GNSS positioning system designed for use in outdoor areas. One of existing indoor positioning systems are the pseudolites, which transmit positioning signals similar to the ones used by GNSS systems. One of the sources of errors for pseudolites is the <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation.</b> Our paper compares the performances of several <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> detection techniques, using Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) navigation signal and determines that errors increases sharply when the receiver uses navigation signals that have <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation.</b> The techniques that we present improve the positioning accuracy, which leads to more precise industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe low-frequency radio sky {{shows the}} {{locations}} of electromagnetic radio sources with a characteristic dilution of precision. Here we report a thorough high-resolution analysis of radio waves from low-frequency (∼ 20 – 150 kHz) radio communication transmitters which are recorded with a small aperture array of radio receivers during the day. It is found that the observed dilution of precision results from the array geometry of the radio receivers, a birefringent wave propagation, and the correlated <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> of low-frequency radio waves. The influence of the array geometry on the dilution of precision is reduced by {{taking into account the}} impulse response of the array. This procedure reveals {{for the very first time}} the splitting of one single radio source into two distinct source locations separated by ∼ 0. 2 °– 1. 9 ° which result from a birefringent wave propagation. The two locations are yet more clearly identified by using the polarity of the modulated wave number vectors of the radio waves. This polarity is also used to quantify the dilution of precision arising from correlated <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> which is discriminated against wave number fluctuations arising from the timing accuracy of the radio receivers. It is found that ∼ 69 % of the wave number variability is of natural origin and ∼ 31 % originates from the timing accuracy of the receivers. The wave number variability from correlated <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> results in a standard deviation ∼ 2 – 8 % relative to the source location. This compact measurement of correlated <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> is used to characterize the uncertainty of source locations in the radio sky. The identification of correlated <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> strongly suggests the existence of very fast processes acting on time scales < 1 ms in the D region ionosphere with physically meaningful effects on low-frequency radio wave propagation. This important result has implications for practical applications in that the observed <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> enables the determination of natural limits for the accuracy of navigation and lightning location methods using low-frequency radio waves...|$|R

40|$|Multipath {{remains a}} {{dominant}} error source in Global Positioning System (GPS) applications that require high accuracy. With {{the use of}} differential techniques {{it is possible to}} remove many of the common-mode error sources, but the error effects of multipath have proven much more difficult to mitigate. The research aim of this work is to enhance the understanding of <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> and its effects in GPS terrestrial applications, through the modelling of signal propagation behaviour and the resultant error effects. <b>Multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> occurs when environmental features cause combinations of reflected and/or diffracted replica signals to arrive at the receiving antenna. These signals, in combination with the original line-of-sight (LOS) signal, can cause distortion of the receiver correlation function and ultimately the discrimination function and hence errors in range estimation. To date, a completely satisfactory mitigation strategy has yet to be developed. In the search for such a mitigation strategy, it is imperative that a comprehensive understanding of the <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> environment and the resultant error effects exists. The work presented here, provides a comprehensive understanding through the use of new modelling and simulation techniques specific to GPS multipath. This dissertation unites the existing theory of radio frequency propagation for the GPS L 1 signal into a coherent treatment of GPS propagation in the terrestrial environment. To further enhance the understanding of the <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> environment and the resultant error effects, this dissertation also describes the design and development of a new parabolic equation (PE) based propagation model for analysis of GPS <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> behaviour. The propagation model improves on previous PE-based models by incorporating terrain features, including boundary impedance properties, backscatter and time-domain decomposition of the field into a multipath impulse response. The results provide visualisation as well as the defining parameters necessary to fully describe the <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> behaviour. These resultant parameters provide the input for a correlation and discrimination model for visualisation and the generation of resultant receiver error measurements. Results for a variety of propagation environments are presented and the technique is shown to provide a deterministic methodology against real GPS data. The unique and novel combined modelling of <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> and reception, presented in this dissertation, provides an effective set of tools that have enhanced the understanding of the behaviour and effect of multipath in GPS applications, and ultimately should aid in providing a solution to the GPS multipath mitigation problem...|$|R

After recalling the usual early–late estimator and its bias in a <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation</b> context, we study the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) based on a signal model including the parametric contribution of reflected components. It results in an efficient algorithm using the existing architecture, which is also very simple and cheap to implement. Simulations show that the results of the proposed algorithm, in a multipath environment, are similar to these of the early–late in a single-path environment. The performance are further characterized, for both MLEs (based on the single-path and <b>multipath</b> <b>propagation)</b> in terms of bias and standard deviation.
