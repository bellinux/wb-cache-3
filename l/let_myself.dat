25|$|Even as an {{adolescent}} {{he realized that}} his real destiny was music. But {{at the insistence of}} his mother, he first went to college, to study philosophy and later law—his father, who had died when Joseph was only seven, had been a lawyer. While at university, however, he continued his musical activities, including composition, although he had had only a few lessons in harmony. Eventually he persuaded his mother to let him show some of his compositions to Edgar Tinel, at the time one of Belgium’s most esteemed musicians. Tinel had never taken on private students (nor would he ever again), “but,” he wrote, “I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be conquered because this young man will one day be someone. He played me a sonata of his. I was stupified. He already is someone, but he has never studied. This fellow has written sonatas, trios, variations, duos …” His mother relented, and from 1891 to 1895 Joseph studied with Tinel.|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, Hope Boren spoke at signing day about her two sons {{prospects}} for at Ohio State: [...] "As a parent, you always try to raise kids who are happy and successful [...] [...] [...] And I know my kids are happy and I think they'll be successful." [...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus." [...] By then, he was projected to be the starting left guard, and he was expected to be an important part of the team.|$|E
2500|$|During a press release, Epic Records {{described}} the album as a deeply personal record; {{speaking about the}} concept and themes on the album, Ciara said [...] "I can sometimes be afraid of my own vulnerability, but this time I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> face it. I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> feel. I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be real. I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> hurt and be healed." [...] Spin and Idolator {{described the}} album as [...] {{an updated version of}} crunk, a sound that Ciara was familiar with in 2004, and contained my pop moments. Ciara explained the influence behind the album's theme saying, ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of the men}} apologized {{before the}} sentencing. Cromitie said, [...] "I've never been a {{terrorist}} and I'll never be a terrorist.

6000|$|... 'I feel it all,' sighed Miss Fennimore; 'but {{it would}} not justify me in <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> be thrust on a family whose {{confidence}} in me has been deceived. Nobody could go with them but you, Miss Charlecote.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And the {{odd thing}} {{is that he was}} absurdly {{grateful}} to me for <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> be saved. He seemed to think I had done him an intentional service, and fallen into the Atlantic {{for the sole purpose of}} letting him pull me out.' ...|$|R

We hurried downstairs, and as soon as I was outside I woke up.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the 2006 Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Prescott apologised for the bad press he had caused the party during the {{previous}} year. He said: [...] "I know in the last year I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> down, I let you down. So Conference, I just want to say sorry", and confirmed that he would stand down as deputy leader when Blair resigned the premiership. Prescott subsequently announced in the House of Commons that he was [...] "... in a rather happy demob stage", in January 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Wayne Rainey {{has to win}} and Eddie Lawson has {{to finish}} outside the top 11 in order for Lawson to lose the {{championship}}. Reflecting on the mistake in Sweden that turned the championship around, Rainey says: “It’s really hard {{to tell you what}} I feel like. I just feel like I’ve been beat up by everybody in the world, and I just feel so down and disappointed in myself. I just felt I really <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> down and my team. You know, it makes you feel like crap.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unjust!--unjust!" [...] said my reason, {{forced by}} the agonising {{stimulus}} into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away, or, if {{that could not be}} effected, never eating or drinking more, and <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> die.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me answer}} him," [...] said Charnock. [...] "I {{feel in the}} mood.

6000|$|Mrs Fyne had no {{difficulty}} in stating the truth. [...] "You see I {{was in the}} very act of <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> out when these two appeared. So that, when that unpleasant young man ran off, I found myself alone with Flora. It was all I could do to hold her in the hall while I called to the servants to come and shut the door." ...|$|R
2500|$|Compared {{with the}} Albatros and Pfalz fighters, the Dr.I offered {{exceptional}} maneuverability. Though the ailerons {{were not very}} effective, the rudder and elevator controls were light and powerful. Rapid turns, especially to the right, were facilitated by the triplane's marked directional instability. Vizefeldwebel Franz Hemer of Jasta 6 said, [...] "The triplane was my favorite fighting machine because it had such wonderful flying qualities. I could <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> stunt – looping and rolling – and could avoid an enemy by diving with perfect safety. The triplane had to be given up because although it was very maneuverable, {{it was no longer}} fast enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Rivers became [...] "another and far happier man – diffidence gave {{place to}} confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a {{somewhat}} laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm". He {{is quoted as}} saying [...] "I have finished my serious work and I shall just <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go." [...] In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking. Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in imaginative literature. Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.|$|E
2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 9 o'clock {{the king}} {{received}} a phone call from the president of the Council, advising him to find refuge in Mafra or Sintra, since the rebels were threatening to bomb the Palace of Necessidades. D.Manuel II refused to leave, saying to those present: [...] "Go if you want, I'm staying. Since the constitution doesn't appoint me any role other than of <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> be killed, I will abide by it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> go?" [...] She spoke mechanically, {{still more}} like an idiot, and felt as if her face flamed out the insincerity of her question. It was vividly back again, {{the vision of the}} real way to act upon Mrs. Gereth. This lady's {{movements}} were now rapid; she turned off from her as quickly as she had seized her, and Fleda sat down to steady herself for full responsibility.|$|R
60|$|SYKES [coming to the Bishop, and {{addressing}} him with dogged desperation] Ive {{come here to}} say this. When I proposed to Edith I was in utter ignorance of what I was <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in for legally. Having given my word, I will stand to it. You have me at your mercy: marry me if you insist. But take notice that I protest. [He sits down distractedly in the railed chair].|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} me to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlisle is a {{supporter}} of several causes. She has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, James, came out to her at age fourteen. Carlisle is also a vegetarian and {{a supporter}} of animal rights. She and her bandmates were the first stars to pose for PETA's [...] "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign in 1990. In a 2013 interview, she talked {{about going back to}} vegetarianism after a long break, stating that [...] "I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt good about it. I wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> think of my plate of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible." [...] She contributed her song [...] "Bless the Beasts and the Children" [...] to the album Tame Yourself to benefit PETA.|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E

6000|$|LIZA [as {{she goes}} out] Well, what I say is right. I won't go near the king, not if I'm {{going to have}} my head cut off.

5000|$|In May, Garcia competed at the Mexican Championships. [...] "My {{performance}} was exactly as planned," [...] she said. [...] "It {{was the first}} competition after my injury so {{it was to get}} back in competition form but without doing very difficult skills — <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> know that I was back in the game. (I did) only bars and beam with full difficulty skills, vault all I did were Yurchenko layouts and on floor I did my first two passes with my coach spotting me, and the rest were very simple tumbling passes." ...|$|R
60|$|The feeble {{gas flame}} {{in the hall}} was still there, on duty, {{as though it had}} never been turned off since I last crossed the hall at half-past eleven in the evening to go to the harbour. The small flame had watched me <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> out; and now, exactly of the same size, the poor little tongue of light (there was {{something}} wrong with that burner) watched me <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in, as indeed it had done many times before. Generally the impression was that of entering an untenanted house, but this time before I could reach {{the foot of the stairs}} Therese glided out of the passage leading into the studio. After the usual exclamations she assured me that everything was ready for me upstairs, had been for days, and offered to get me something to eat at once. I accepted and said I would be down in the studio in half an hour. I found her there by the side of the laid table ready for conversation. She began by telling me—the dear, poor young Monsieur—in a sort of plaintive chant, that there were no letters for me, no letters of any kind, no letters from anybody. Glances of absolutely terrifying tenderness mingled with flashes of cunning swept over me from head to foot while I tried to eat.|$|R
