Briefly, outer theca of horse chestnut seed was ground under wet conditions with a mass colloider (stone mill type crusher) with a clearance of 40  μm, before blending with desired amounts of pulp and <b>latex</b> <b>binder.</b> The pulp used was prepared by refining Canadian-bleached conifer kraft pulp to a standard freeness of 550  mL with a refiner. Aica Aibon RAX 117 (Aica Kogyo, Kiyosu, Aichi, Japan), a <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> (emulsion) made of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), was used to improve the adhesion between pulp and the ground outer theca of horse chestnut seed. Then, the ground outer theca of horse chestnut seed was blended with a prescribed amount of the bleached conifer kraft pulp and the <b>latex</b> <b>binder.</b> Compounded papers containing the ground outer theca of horse chestnut seed were prepared as described previously. The ground horse chestnut seed content was adjusted to 20, 40, 60 wt% in the formulation; the <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> content was 0.3 wt% of the combined amount of the ground outer theca of horse chestnut seed and the pulp in all the formulations.

An angular-sheeting machine (PU- 401; Tester Sangyo, Saitama, Japan) was used to adjust the slurries to a paper weight of 100  g/m 2. The sheets were pressed at 410  kPa at room temperature and dried at 120  °C with a rotating drier to prepare compounded papers containing the ground outer theca of horse chestnut seed.|$|E

The research of alumina membranes was improved a great deal, however, {{they have always been}} considered as an opportunity in commercial product. In this research, submicron alumina powders, AKP- 30 were deposited on the porous alumina tube support containing approximately 40 % porosity by dip coating.

It was found that the thickness of membrane layer depend on the type of binders (<b>latex</b> <b>binder,</b> polyvinyl alcohol binder, and poly (ethylene oxide) polymer binder) and dipping time when the withdrawal speed was constant. The proper suspension of 30 wt. % AKP- 30 alumina powder with 18. 8 wt. % <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> provided proper sintered membrane without cracking or delaminating. The porosity and average pore size of coating layer was about 29 % and 0. 06 µm, respectively at a sintering temperature of 1400 ºC for 2 hr.

Secant Young’s modulus and failure strain master curves were constructed for each film through time-temperature superposition, allowing predictions beyond the experimental timescale at a selected reference temperature.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the thermal transfer through porous media {{by means of}} measurement of the effective thermal conductivity and modelling of the structural parameters. While {{most of the work}} is of a general nature, the porous media in focus are pigment plus <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> systems as used for paper coatings. As such, the application field of thermal effects in printing is discussed. At first the use of a dynamic measurement method for the thermal conductivity of porous coating pigment binder systems in the form of tablets is evaluated. In addition, a Lumped Parameter Model is developed to analyse the measured thermal conductivities in terms of the material volume fractions and their structural configuration. The model therefore uses two independent structural parameters instead of porosity alone as the governing parameter. This enables a discussion following modelling approaches adopting parameter modelling and structural modelling. A combination of both is used to discuss the solid-solid connectivity of pigment binder systems. It is shown by the model parameter of pigment connectivity that a disruption of the pigment packing already at low concentrations of binder occurs related to surface and colloid chemistry factors which cause the binder to accumulate first at pigment nodal points. The analysis of different pigment binder systems shows that, due to the presence of two interacting solid phases, the effective thermal conductivity cannot be modelled by using porosity and pore structure alone, but also requires the additional parameter of dual solid phase connectivity. It is proposed, therefore, that a combination of pore structure analysis and thermal conductivity measurement can be used to identify and parameterise subtleties in interactive particulate systems. For the application of toner fusing in electrophotography it is shown that a thermally insulating coating layer leads to a concentration of the fusing energy on the surface, thus aiding the fusing/adhesion development of the toner while shielding the base paper from undesired heating. In the heatset web-offset drying process, an insulating precoating in combination with liquid barrier properties can lead to a similar shielding of the base paper and thus helps to maintain an even moisture profile effectively reducing the waving/fluting tendency...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{consumer}} habits and {{the replacement of}} solid trans fats in foodstuffs with unsaturated fats have increased the demand for low-cost grease-resistant packaging materials worldwide. Taking into account the global aim to reduce our dependence on oil-based plastics, new bio-based solutions are needed {{to meet the demand}} for sustainable packaging solutions, and the development of such materials was the focus of the work reported in this thesis. Pigmented dispersion barrier coatings were prepared using a blade-coating technique on commercial solid bleached sulphate paperboard. The coatings consisted of a bio-based component, hydroxypropylated starch or hydroxypropyl cellulose, a styrene-butadiene <b>latex</b> <b>binder,</b> and talc. The grease resistance in terms of time taken for a model grease to penetrate the coated paperboard varied between a few hours and several days, depending on the coating composition and on the ambient temperature during the test. Particular attention was given to coatings that prevented oil to penetrate the whole 24 h test period described in ISO 16532 - 1. The feasibility of producing barrier-coated boards was studied from the viewpoints of the finishing and converting processes and their end-use applications. The findings suggested that corona treatment should be used with caution if the board is to be printed, since it may cause a drastic decrease in oil penetration time due to strike through that occur if the voltage of the discharge is sufficiently high to change the electrical conductivity of the sample. The oil barrier was impaired regardless of whether the uncoated or the coated side of the board was treated with corona. Moreover, the coatings did not prevent the occurrence of reverse side effects. Unexpectedly, contact angle determinations suggested that exposure to heat in converting processes may even improve the oil repellency of dispersion coatings containing pigments due to the migration of latex towards the outer surface. Migrated latex also induced self-healing of the coating, according to scanning electron microscope (SEM) images that indicated the disappearance of pinholes. The oil and grease resistance (OGR) was, however, dependent on the oil viscosity and fatty acid composition. Particularly with moderately grease-resistant samples, the penetration time of pure coconut and rapeseed oils was considerably longer than that of their mixtures. Finally, press forming of paperboard led to a decrease in oil penetration time, but none of the studied coating compositions completely lost their barrier properties. The developed coating formulations seem to have a potential in many commercial sustainable packaging applications in a transitional period before implementation of completely bio-based coatings on an industrial scale. Potential uses may include e. g. instant meal trays and fast food packages, but particular attention should be paid to the effects of converting and finishing processes on the physical and barrier properties of the materials...|$|E

The study was mainly concerned with the powder processing parameters such as the spray drying, the type and concentration of organic binder, and the distribution of particles. Experiments with the spray drying variables were conducted in the laboratory and in the pilot scale dryer Factorial analysis was carried out to estimate the main and interacting effects of the independent variables on the response. A mathematical model for the mean particle size of the spray dried granules was also developed to optimize the operating condition of the dryer. The adequacy of the model was verified by statistical analysis Improved powder characteristics were achieved by optimizing the spray drying variables Varistor performance and powder characteristics had shown significant correlation Optimum spray drying conditions were identified depending on the electrical characteristics of the varistor. The influence of different latex binders and their blends for a fixed concentration of binder and solid in the slurry was initially evaluated. Among the various binders including the conventional PVA, the <b>latex</b> <b>binder,</b> Ltx C was found to be superior The slurry with a low level of the new binder and a high solid content produced powder with further enhancement in powder properties. The fracture strength of the green and sintered body made from the powder with different binder systems were analyzed by Weibull approach. The estimation of the Weibull parameters indicated that a more reliable green and sintered body can be generated by using a lower level of Ltx C and a higher level of solid in the slurry However, the best binder, its level and solid concentration were selected on the basis of the performance characteristics of the varistor. Regarding the particle size fraction, the physical and electrical properties were not very different for the coarse, medium and wide distribution of powder However, the green and the fired density of the discs produced from the fine fraction of powder were higher. Though the varistor with fine fractions exhibited higher nominal voltage but was poor in terms of energy absorption capability. In addition to the powder processing, an investigation was conducted to assess the effect of passivation thickness on the performance of the varistor. The energy absorption capability of the varistor was found to be highly sensitive to this thickness Neither too thin nor too a thick coating of glassing was found to be favourable. Failure mode was also changed with the passivation thickness Thicker passivation generated pinholes as a result of higher insulation, whereas, thinner passivation led to flashover due to dielectric breakdown.

Strategies for combining the positive properties of alkyds, e. g. autoxidative curing, gloss and penetration in wood, with the fast drying and gloss and color retention properties of acrylic latexes have mainly been directed towards the modification of the alkyd with an acrylate during alkyd synthesis followed by emulsification.

Cryo-TEM analysis indicated that, whereas tert-butyl hydroperoxide initiation resulted in the formation of heterogeneous particles, fatty-acid hydroperoxide-initiated hybrid particles showed no intra-particle heterogeneity. An AFM study of the film formation process of the oil/alkyd-acrylic hybrid latexes showed that phase separation occurred between the oil and the acrylic phases upon drying, resulting in films that consist of deformed acrylic particles embedded in a continuous matrix of oil.

40|$|Coating {{shrinkage}} upon drying is {{a phenomenon}} well known to the paper coating industry, where it often causes changes in the final structure of the coating layer leading to poor results in terms of gloss, light scattering, surface strength, coverage, uniformity and printability. Such shrinkage has in previous studies been wrongly associated with shrinkage of the polymeric binders used in the coating formulation, by making erroneous comparison with solvent-based paint systems. Natural binders, as starch or proteins, which come from renewable resources and are therefore environmentally friendly, suffer more from this shrinkage phenomenon than synthetic binders. The aim of this research project was to improve {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in the drying of a coating layer and to create a model able to describe them. Shrinkage while the coating layer dries has been successfully measured by observing the deflection of coated strips of a synthetic elastically-deformable substrate.

The final dry coatings were studied with mercury porosimetry and by scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise their porous structure. The flow and rheological properties of the coating colour formulations were measured in order to probe the particle-particle interaction between the different species in the wet coating colour. The void space of the dry coating layers was modelled using Pore-Cor, a software which generates simulated porous networks. A new algorithm was developed to model, within the simulated void space, the effective particles or "skeletal elements" representative of the solid phase of the dried porous system. The water-filled porous structures {{at the beginning of the}} shrinkage process (first critical concentration, FCC) were subsequently modelled by creating Pore-Cor structures with the same solid skeletal elements distribution as at the second critical concentration (at which the particles lock their positions), but with higher given porosity to account for the water present The capillary forces acting on the surface of the simulated coating were calculated, and found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the measured shrinkage forces. The shrinkage process was thus described as resulting from the effect of capillary forces in the plane of the coating layer resisted by a stick-slip process, where the capillary forces yield shrinkage only if a resistance force within the drying coating layer holds the structure in place and allows the menisci to form. The stick-slip theory was strongly supported by quantitative comparisons between the experimental forces required to intrude mercury, and the capillary forces within the simulated void structure.

40|$|The ever rising {{need for}} {{detailed}} {{knowledge of the}} structure of paper coating urges the improvement and development of new techniques for gaining new and valuable information. The assessment, study and characterisation of factors that are assumed to affect the interaction between printing inks and coated paper surface may be accomplished by microscopy and image analysis techniques. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a most suitable tool for morphometrical studies of fibres and paper. Digital images acquired in a SEM, by the secondary electron imaging (SEI) or backscattered electron imaging (BEI) mode have suitable quality and resolution for further image processing and analysis. The present study exemplifies how microscopy and image analysis may be applied for structural studies of the coating layer. Image processing and analysis routines for acquiring information on the coating layer surface roughness and porosity details like the pore shape, size and orientation are described. A routine, based on the Sobel operators, for measuring the pigment particle orientation, is also described. The developed semi-automatic image analysis routines are useful methods for morphometric analysis of paper structure details, thus facilitating numerical data acquisition of the pores and the pigment particles’ geometry. Parts of the obtained information is assumed to be unattainable by other methods at this point. To discern the binder in the coating layer from the embedding epoxy and thus observe individual pores in the coating, the binder has to be stained before embedding. In the study, osmium tetroxide (O s O 4) was used to stain the <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> in the coating layer. Morphometric analyses of paper cross-sections using SEM, BEI-mode images and stereo images were used to quantify the paper coating structure details. The smallest details to be quantified are approaching the limitations given by the imaging methods. It is shown that the staining procedures allow a quite accurate determination of pore fraction in the coating, and individual readings of the pores like pore area, aspect ratio and orientation. Two compared staining methods differed somewhat in their effect on the paper. O s O 4 dissolved in water gave good staining throughout the base paper/coating sandwich, allowing good visualisation and assessment of the coating structure. However, moisture tends to make the base paper fibre expand, raising the paper thickness and thus the macro-roughness. When staining by dry O s O 4 crystals, the base paper expansion is avoided, however, even the staining of the fibres is reduced. Critical coating parameters like mean pore area and micro-roughness of the coating layer do not differ between the two methods. In the study, the structure of commercial LWC paper coating layers were assessed and quantified by SEM, BEI-mode and digital image analysis of cross sections. It is quantified how clay particles cause a more densely packed coating structure compared to coatings containing mainly CaCO 3. The pores of clay coatings have a larger aspect ratio and are oriented more parallel to the paper surface. Pore orientation is affected by the pigment particle orientation. Besides the size of the pores, their orientation is proved to be an essential parameter affecting the achieved print gloss level for a given paper grade. The pore’s orientation/ diameter ratio seems to be a suitable parameter for describing its geometry and influence on print gloss. For a given pore diameter, the more horizontally oriented, the higher the delta gloss (print gloss-paper gloss). dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Paper based {{materials}} have limited vapour barrier properties. Several techniques {{have been developed}} to overcome this limitation. One of such technique is the use of barrier dispersion coatings. These barriers are continuous and solid layers normally applied on the surface of paper materials. Dispersion coatings are normally composed of two materials; a <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> and filler particles. The interaction between these materials creates tortuous pathways that reduce the diffusion of the permeant. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop an understanding of how the dispersion coatings can be designed to optimise the barrier properties of paper materials. In particular, the aim was to comprehend the effect of fillers added into dispersion coatings on the permeability with the purpose of developing of a model for predicting permeability. A number of models {{have been developed to}} predict the permeability of barrier films such as thermoplastic composites but none have been applied or developed for use on barrier dispersion coatings. These models are normally based on idealised geometries, where the fillers are arranged in either oriented or random ways. The heterogeneous characteristics of the barrier dispersion coatings, such as uneven coating thickness, particle size and the lower elongation of the fillers used in dispersion coatings limit the use of the existing models for the prediction of dispersion coating barrier performance. To develop a predictive model, the characterisation of aspects such as shape, size distribution and volume fraction of fillers in barrier coatings and their effect on the barrier performance were studied. The analysis of the geometry of fillers was carried out by image analysis from microscopy (scanning electron and light microscopes). This was carried out on three types of kaolin clays. The shapes, Feret diameters, and thicknesses of the clays were characterised. The filler shapes were elongated with an average ratio between the major and minor diameter being no larger than two. The Fourier series descriptor approximates the filler shape at the second harmonic. The Feret diameter and thickness were fitted to distribution curves. These distributions were used to define the fillers for generation of particle populations required for modelling. The particle populations can be based on either assuming representative filler shapes such as rectangular or elliptical plates or by the Fourier series descriptor. Characterisation of dispersion coatings were also carried out. The dispersion coatings were formulated by styrene-butadiene latex and mixed with the selected clays at several filler volume fractions and applied on 160 ∙− 2 linerboards. The characterisation was based on the measurement of water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (O 2 TR). The coating thickness was also measured by scanning electron microscopy image analysis. The WVTR and O 2 TR were shown to be sensitive to the type of filler, volume fraction of filler, and thickness of the coatings. Both the WVTR and O 2 TR tended to be lower as the filler size, filler volume fraction, and coating thickness increased. The thickness of the coating was found to be dependent on the coating process (coated rod), coating formulation, and its variability on the linerboard topography. The proposed model predicted the relative permeability based on the estimation of permeant flux by the Fick’s first law through three dimensional coating geometries. The coatings were filled with rectangular plates randomly located. These plates were defined by distribution curves of maximum Feret diameter, elongation, and thickness of the selected clays. The amount of fillers in the coating was determined by part of filler volume fractions used for measurements of WVTR and O 2 TR. The sizes of the geometries were defined by the representative elemental volume estimated from the filler volume fraction and the variation of the predictions. The geometries were generated by programming in Matlab under particular conditions of coating formulation and exposure. The mathematical solution of the model was carried out by finite element method and solved by Comsol Multiphysics. As expected from the experimental characterisation of the coatings, the predictions indicated that the relative permeability reduced as the volume fraction of filler and the size of the clay increased; however, overestimation of the barrier properties were predicted. To understand the reasons for the discrepancy, several factors, that were not included in the conceptual model, were analysed. It was observed that the filler agglomeration and uncoated areas was the most significant factor that may affect the prediction of the relative permeability. Other factors such the uniformity of coating profile, and filler shape were found to have an effect on the prediction. Despite the discrepancy, the model was suitable for prediction of how to improve barrier performance trend. Thus, it was possible to evaluate different factors related to the barrier performance to find their best combination. In order to optimise the formulation of barrier dispersion coatings, sensitivity analyses were carried out based on factors that affect the permeability. Filler settling in the coating or coatings with two layers were found to provide a reduction of relative permeability. This technique also may reduce the material used for coating preparation and the occurrence of uncoated areas. However, these effects were smaller than the effect of filler agglomeration on the barrier performance. For this reason, future studies should be focused on the improvement of dispersion of fillers in the coating binder. The application of the model in other coating formulations must consider the definitions of the concepts used in the study in order to apply the correct information for running simulations. Because this model was the first approach developed for dispersion coatings, several aspects were fully not explored in this study. In future research may be focused on the improvement of filler geometry characterisation, dispersion of fillers in the coating binder, incorporation of coating irregularities in the conceptual model, and incorporation of commercial coatings additives in the model. These points may increase the complexity of the model; however, it is expected that such complexity will be practical to be included in the model in the near future due to advances in computing capability for FEM simulations...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of nanosized copolymer latexes by the polymerization in miniemulsions prepared by the classical high energy and the low energy phase inversion concentration (PIC) methods. In addition, the encapsulation of various organic pigments with copolymer latex layers was carried out {{on the basis of}} miniemulsion polymerization. The obtained nanosized copolymer particles or encapsulated pigments have been successfully used as binders or hybrid binders for textile printing applications. The first part {{deals with the}} preparation of nanosized copolymer latexes in a diameter size range between (50 - 100 nm) by the classical miniemulsion polymerization method. The copolymer latexes composed mainly of a high content of the soft butyl acrylate monomer (BA) and a low content of the hard methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer. The addition of small amounts of functional monomers such as methacrylic acid MAA and N-methylol acrylamide NMA to some miniemulsion recipes allowed to impart cross-linking sites and functionality to the copolymer chains. The particle size analysis, structure characterization and thermal properties of the latexes were investigated by many analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The optimized miniemulsion latexes were applied successfully as binders for the pigment printing and inkjet printing of cotton fabrics. The main objective of this part was to examine the application of the miniemulsion latexes as binders in the textile printing processes {{in order to reduce the}} risk of agglomeration and cloaking of the printer screens and nozzles during the printing process. The evaluation of the printed fabrics showed that the miniemulsion binders with their smaller size offered technological advantages over the conventional processes for the conventional and inkjet printing processes as well as the better print properties. Accordingly by optimized use of the miniemulsion method one is not only able to control the particle size but also to improve the properties of these latexes for textile applications. In the second part, we studied the encapsulation of organic pigments with polymer latex layers by miniemulsion polymerization. Such polymer-encapsulated pigments then can be applied for inkjet printing without addition of separate binder additives, thereby reducing the risk of unfavorite interactions between the separate latex and pigment particles. The encapsulation of C. I. Pigment red 112 was systematically studied by a miniemulsion polymerization of pigment/butyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate (BA-MMA) or styrene-co-butyl acrylate (St-BA) copolymers. The ratio of monomer to pigment was varied in order to find optimum conditions for the preparation of self-curable hybrid pigment inks for the textile inkjet printing application. The particle size and polydispersity of the pigment dispersions and pigment hybrid latex particles were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), disc centrifuge particle size analyzer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The efficiency of the polymer encapsulation and the thermal properties of the hybrid inks were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The evaluation of the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics with different encapsulated and non-encapsulated pigment colors showed that the encapsulated inks without addition of separate polymer <b>latex</b> <b>binder</b> generate fully satisfying values that compare favourably in terms of color strength, rubbing and washing fastness to the non-encapsulated conventional inks, while avoiding problems of clogging and colloidal instability. In the last part, the low energy phase inversion composition (PIC) method was used for the formation of monomer based nanoemulsions from a system composed of monomer/Brij 78 /water. These nanoemulsions were used as templates for generating polymer and copolymer nanoparticles. Styrene was used as monomer for studying the phase diagram, where parameters such as the O/S ratio and water addition rate influence the formation of the nanoemulsion and the structure of the final polymer particles. Hexadecane was added to the oil phase with a concentration 4 wt% (relative to the oil) to achieve stability against Oswald ripening. Nanoemulsions with a fixed water content of 80 wt% and O/S ratios from 0. 25 to 9 generated polymer particles with diameters between 30 to 110 nm as determined from dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The polydispersity of the polymer nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the O/S ratio. Different copolymer latexes based on styrene, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with a fixed O/S ratio 9 and water content 80 %, applied successfully as binders for the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics and compared to corresponding copolymer latexes prepared by the high-energy methods or the conventional methods. The results indicated that PIC method constitutes a very interesting and innovative way to generate nanosized polymer latex particles using a simple setup of emulsification experiments. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Herstellung von Copolymer Latices durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation und die bisher hierfür noch wenig eingesetzte Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode untersucht. Zudem wurde die Verkapselung verschiedener Pigmentfarben über das Konzept der Miniemulsionspolymerisation durchgeführt. Die durch die verschiedenen Methoden hergestellten Copolymer Teilchen bzw. die verkapselten Pigmente wurden erfolgreich als Bindemittel für Textildruckanwendungen angewendet. Das erste experimentelle Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit der Herstellung von Copolymer Latices im Größenbereich von 50 - 100 nm hergestellt durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation. Diese Copolymer Latices bestehen hauptsächlich aus einem hohen Anteil an weichem Butylacrylat-Monomers (BA) und einem niedrigen Gehalt an hartem Methylmethacrylat (MMA) Monomer. Die strukturelle Charakterisierung und die thermischen Eigenschaften der Latex Teilchen erfolgte durch viele analytische Verfahren, wie dynamische Lichtstreuung (DLS), Kleinwinkelneutronenstreuung (SANS), Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie (TEM), Gel-Permeations-Chromatographie (GPC) und Registrierende Differentialkalorimetrie (DSC). Die optimierten Miniemulsion Latices wurden dann erfolgreich als Bindemittel für den Pigmentdruck und Tintenstrahldruck von Gewebe aus Baumwolle eingesetzt. Das Hauptziel dieser Teil der Arbeit war es, die Anwendung der Miniemulsion Latices als Bindemittel in Textildruckverfahren zu untersuchen, wobei diese das Risiko von Agglomeration und damit das Verstopfen der Düsen während des Druckprozesses verringern sollen. Dieser Nachteil resultiert meist aus unerwünscht hohen Partikelgrößen, der Form der herkömmlichen Bindemitteln oder auch anderen Bestandteilen. Die Auswertung der Druckexperimente ergaben, dass die Miniemulsion basierten Bindemittel mit ihrer geringeren Größe technologische Vorteile gegenüber den herkömmlichen Verfahren bieten, sowohl für das konventionelle Druckverfahren als auch für das Tintenstrahldruckverfahren und dabei auch zu verbesserten Druckeigenschaften führen. Der zweite Teil der Dissertation befasst sich mit der Verkapselung des organischen Pigments durch Polymerlatex Schichten, um die Agglomeration der Pigmentpartikel zu minimieren und ihre Stabilität und Dispergierbarkeit zu verbessern, was zu deren verbesserten Anwendbarkeit beitragen soll. Die Verkapselung der Pigmente wurde durch Miniemulsionspolymerisation mit verschiedenen Monomeren wie Styrol, Methylmethacrylat oder Butylacrylat durchgeführt. Die Analyse der Partikelgröße sowie der Einkapselungseffizienz der verkapselten Pigmente wurde mit Hilfe vieler analytischer Methoden untersucht und mit den nicht verkapselten Pigmenten verglichen. Die verkapselten Pigmente wurden dann erfolgreich als Tinten formuliert und ohne technische Probleme, wie das Verstopfen der Düsen der Druckmaschinen, für das Tintenstrahldrucken von Gewebe aus Baumwolle verwendet. Der letzte Teil des Projektes beschäftigte sich mit der Herstellung von Latex Teilchen mit einem Durchmesser von ca. 30 - 100 nm, die durch Nanoemulsionspolymerisation hergestellt wurden, wobei die Nanoemulsionen durch die Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode hergestellt wurden. Die monomerhaltigen Nanoemulsionen waren Systemen bestehend aus Wasser, Monomer und nichtionischen Tensids. Wir verwendeten Styrol als Monomer für die systematische Untersuchung des Phasenverhaltens und der Bildung der Monomer-Nanoemulsion sowie deren anschließender Polymerisation. Das Phasenverhalten des Systems aus Wasser / Brij 78 (Polyoxyethylen (20) Stearylether) / Styrol ergab den geeigneten Bereich, in dem mit Monomer Nanoemulsionen gebildet werden können. Die Polymerisation in den PIC Nanoemulsionen wurde dann mit verschiedenen Monomeren durchgeführt, um entsprechend unterschiedliche Copolymerpartikel zu synthetisieren. Die Nanoemulsion Latices wurden dann wiederum für die Anwendung als Bindemittel für die normale Bedruckung und den Tintenstrahldruck von Gewebe aus Baumwolle getestet und verglichen mit Copolymeranaloga die über das klassische Miniemulsionsverfahren erhalten worden waren. Diese zeigte, dass die Untersuchung solcher PIC Nanoemulsionen und deren anschließende Polymerisation eine sehr interessante und innovative Möglichkeit darstellt, um neuartige Nanopolymerlatexpartikel für Druckanwendungen zu erzeugen...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this dissertation has been twofold: to develop a water-based system for tape casting and to build laminar structures from the tapes. A set of requirements on the binder was specified and latexes were identified as suitable for water-based tape casting, mainly owing to their low viscosity and high polymeric content. A systematic approach {{was used to evaluate}} different formulations throughout the processing chain to find possibilities and limitations. Rheological measurements were used to characterise stability and flow behaviour of the suspensions and to study interactions between constituents in the suspension. The effect of the dispersant concentration was studied. It was found that, below optimum dosage, i. e. monolayer coverage, bridging flocculation can occur and the dispersant can adsorb onto latex particles. Tape casting experiments were done to investigate possible casting rates, resulting thickness and the thickness at which spontaneous cracking occurs. The cast tapes were then evaluated with regard to their quality, green density and homogeneity. It has been shown in this work that very high solids loading (> 55 vol%) can be reached in alumina systems thanks to efficient dispersants and <b>latex</b> <b>binders</b> with a high polymeric content. This in combination with an efficient drying system of the tape caster enabled high casting rates to be reached. The lowest viscous formulations also gave tapes thicker than 0. 5 mm without cracking. Significant differences between binders were observed in this work. For example, in a comparison between anionic and nonionic latexes, the nonionic latex gave a more homogeneous packing of the green tape and higher final density. In the anionically stabilised latexes, phase separation between surfactant and polymer occurred, creating pore channels in the tape. The work on laminar structures focused mainly on ceramic laminates with crack deflecting ability. These types of structures {{have been shown to be}} more damage tolerant and to have superior thermal shock resistance. Examples of laminates of this type are SiC/graphite and dense/porous laminates of alumina or SiC using fugitive particles. A technique for fabricating the latter type of laminates was developed in this work. The composite is a laminate of alternating porous and dense layers of the same material. To be able to co-sinter these types of layers, it is necessary that the added fugitive particles do not affect the stability of the suspension, i. e. the packing of the ceramic matrix in the layers should be the same. Hereby the dense and porous layers sinter with the same total shrinkage, and the fugitive particles (mainly starch particles) leave voids too large to sinter themselves and will shrink only by the same amount as the surrounding matrix, leaving porosity. The advantage of such a composite is that no chemical reaction or thermal mismatch is present between the layers. During casting, when the suspension passes under the casting blade, the shearing can cause particles and polymer to be oriented in the direction of the flow. This can be used deliberately to enhance mechanical, electrical or thermal properties. However, it can also cause sintering anisotropy, making close dimensional tolerances difficult to control. The conditions that give rise to shrinkage anisotropy were studied. Water-based systems were shown to be on a par with or better than organic solvent-based systems. A desirable particle orientation benefits from a high volume fraction, elongated or plate-like particles and a high shear rate. This was exploited in making a laminate structure with alternating porous and dense layers from a coarse low sinterability powder and a fine plate-like powder for the respective layers...|$|R
40|$|The present work shows a way {{to develop}} an {{industrial}} organic solvent-free process for lithium-ion battery electrodes manufacturing. The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF <b>latex</b> as a <b>binder</b> in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO 2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper {{on the surface of}} the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes has been carried out with cycling tests in coin cells, confirming the cycling stability during charge/discharge cycles. Cycling performances of the water-based cathodes containing coated active material particles are comparable to a reference NMP-based cathode, while uncoated particles show a sensibly lower capacity retention during cycling.
