40|$|International audienceMajor volcano flank collapses {{strongly}} {{affect the}} underlying magmatic plumbing system. Here, {{we consider the}} magma storage zone as a <b>liquid</b> <b>pocket</b> embedded in an elastic medium, and we perform numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry {{as well as in}} three dimensions in order to evaluate the consequences of a major collapse event. We quantify the pressure decrease induced within and around a magma reservoir by a volcano flank collapse. This pressure reduction is expected to favor replenishment with less evolved magma from deeper sources. We also estimate the impact of the magma pressure decrease, together with the stress field variations around the reservoir, on the eruptive event associated with the edifice failure. We show that, for a given magma reservoir geometry, the collapse of a large strato-volcano tends to reduce the volume of the simultaneous eruption; destabilization of large edifices may even suppress magma emission, resulting in phreatic eruptions instead. This effect is greater for shallow reservoirs, and is more pronounced for spherical reservoirs than for vertically-elongated ones. It is reduced for compressible magmas containing a large amount of volatiles. Over a longer time scale, the modification of pressure conditions for dyke initiation at the chamber wall may also explain an increase in eruption rate as well as an apparent change of magma storage location...|$|E
40|$|The {{free energy}} of the solid and fluid phases of the Girifalco C 60 model are {{determined}} through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. In this model the molecules interact through a spherical pair potential, characterized by a narrow and attractive well, adjacent to a harshly repulsive core. We have used the Widom test particle method and a mapping from an Einstein crystal, in order to estimate the absolute free energy in the fluid and solid phases, respectively; we have then determined the free energy along several isotherms, and the whole phase diagram, by means of standard thermodynamic integrations. We highlight how the interplay between the liquid-vapor and the liquid-solid coexistence conditions determines {{the existence of a}} narrow <b>liquid</b> <b>pocket</b> in the phase diagram, whose stability is assessed and confirmed in agreement with previous studies. In particular, the critical temperature follows closely an extended corresponding-states rule recently outlined by Noro and Frenkel [J. Chem. Phys. 113 : 2941 (2000) ]. We discuss the emerging "energetic" properties of the system, which drive the phase behavior in systems interacting through short-range forces [A. A. Louis, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 359 : 939 (2001) ], in order to explain the discrepancy between the predictions of several structural indicators and the results of full free energy calculations, to locate the fluid phase boundaries. More generally, we aim to provide extended reference data for calculations of the free {{energy of the}} C 60 fullerite in the low temperature regime, as for the determination of the phase diagram of higher order fullerenes and other fullerene-related materials, whose description is based on the same model adopted in this work.

Interaction of thin liquid sheets with immersed rigid bodies is improved with newly proposed object-liquid boundary conditions. Efficient calculation of largescale animations is supported via a multiple grid pipelined flow method and a novel moving grid windowing technique.

We show from classical nucleation theory that this is expected: S ∼ 1. 6 corresponds to the point where nucleation first becomes observable on experimental time scales. A consequence of the high supersaturations reached at the onset of nucleation is the very rapid growth of a single skeletal (Hopper) crystal.

The aim of {{this work}} is to study by X-Ray microtomography carried out at ESRF Grenoble the {{microstructure}} of an Al- 4 wt%Cu alloy which was previously cold rolled to obtain globules of the solid phase upon heating in the semi-solid range. Since this process produced entrapped liquid in the globules, 3 D quantification of this liquid was performed. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} addition to the alloy of a small amount of Ba, which has been shown to decrease the contiguity between the solid globules {{as a consequence of the}} decrease of the solid-liquid interfacial energy σsl, was investigated. It is in particular shown that the amount of entrapped liquid is much larger in the Ba-containing alloy in agreement with the reduction of σsl, whereas the size of the <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> is similar. In addition characterization of the interglobular liquid shows that the interface area between this liquid and the solid per unit volume is larger for the alloys containing Ba in agreement with previous observations carried out on 2 D sections.

However, {{little is known about}} the time course of GIT liquid volumes after drinking a glass of water (8 oz), particularly in the colon, which is a targeted site for both locally and systemically acting drug products. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies offered novel insights on GIT liquid distribution in fasted humans in the stomach and small intestine, and showed that freely mobile liquid in the intestine collects in fairly distinct regions or “pockets”. Based on this previous pilot data, we hypothesized that (1) it is possible to quantify the time course of the volume and number of <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> in the undisturbed colon of fasted healthy humans following ingestion of 240 mL, using noninvasive MRI methods; (2) the amount of freely mobile water in the fasted human colon is of the order of only a few milliliters. Twelve healthy volunteers fasted overnight and underwent fasted abdominal MRI scans before drinking 240 mL (∼ 8 fluid ounces) of water. After ingesting the water they were scanned at frequent intervals for 2 h. The images were processed to quantify freely mobile water in the total and regional colon: ascending, transverse, and descending. The fasted colon contained (mean ± SEM) 11 ± 5 <b>pockets</b> of resting <b>liquid</b> with a total volume of 2 ± 1 mL (average). The colonic fluid peaked at 7 ± 4 mL 30 min after the water drink. This peak fluid was distributed in 17 ± 7 separate <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> in the colon. The regional analysis showed that pockets of free fluid were found primarily in the ascending colon. The interindividual variability was very high; the subjects showed a range of number of colonic fluid pockets from 0 to 89 and total colonic freely mobile fluid volume from 0 to 49 mL. This is the first study measuring the time course of the number, regional location, and volume of pockets of freely mobile liquid in the undisturbed colon of fasted humans after ingestion of a glass of water. Novel insights into the colonic fluid environment will be particularly relevant to improve our understanding and design of the in vivo performance of controlled release formulations targeted to the colon.

Anurag Sharma, a geochemist, James Scott, a microbiologist, {{and others at the}} Carnegie Institution of Washington performed an experiment with Diamond Anvil Cell and utilized [...] "direct observations" [...] on microbial activity to over 1.0 Gigapascal pressures (Sharma et al. 2002, Science).Their goal was to test microbes and discover under what level of pressure they can carry out life processes. The experiments were performed up to 1.6 GPa of pressure, which is more than 16,000 times Earth’s surface pressure (Earth’s surface pressure is 985 hPa). The experiment began by placing a solution of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, in a film and placing it in the DAC. The pressure was then raised to 1.6 GPa. When raised to this pressure and kept there for 30 hours, at least 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution and also monitored formate metabolism using in-situ Raman spectroscopy. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice.

The shapes of most <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> are crystallographically-controlled, with many corners having angles greater than 60 °. Few crystal/liquid triple junctions develop the interfacial energy-controlled dihedral angles (θ), which form in experiments using finely-ground powders of minerals with poor cleavage. Liquid interconnectivity probably is attained at 875 °C with only 2 % liquid, indicating that dihedral angles less than 60 ° {{may not be}} necessary to achieve interconnectivity in partially melted metamorphic rocks. The surfaces between elongated grains in lineated rocks can become pathways for the migration of liquid or the diffusion of components. By 850 °C, hornblende begins to dehydrate at internal nucleation sites, producing a texture of hornblende rims and clinopyroxene cores (generally attributed to hydration of clinopyroxene). Within the temperature interval of 850 – 900 °C, transient vapor generates layers of low viscosity, H_ 2 O-saturated, granitoid liquid between hornblende and plagiocase crystal faces, potentially capable of segregation if time-temperature relationships are suitable. At higher temperatures the increased liquid fraction is H 2 O-undersaturated, with viscosity too high to permit segregation. There is a prospect that segregation of initially hydrous liquids could contribute to the dehydration of low-potassium amphibolites and effectively remove incompatible trace elements during the transition from amphibolite-facies to granulite-facies. Further experiments are needed to {{study the effects of}} time and temperature on textures in anisotropic rocks, particularly lineated amphibolites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeformation-assisted {{segregation}} of metallic and sulphidic liquid from a solid peridotitic matrix {{is a process}} that may contribute to the early differentiation of small planetesimals into a metallic core and a silicate mantle. Here we present results of an experimental study using a simplified system consisting of a polycrystalline Fo 90 -olivine matrix containing a small percentage of iron sulphide and a synthetic primitive MORB melt, in order to investigate whether the silicate melt enhances the interconnection and {{segregation of}} FeS liquid under deformation conditions at varying strain rates. The experiments have been performed at 2 GPa, 1450 [*]°C and strain rates between 1 × 10 − 3 s− 1 to 1 × 10 − 5 s− 1. Our results show that the presence of silicate melt actually hinders the migration and segregation of sulphide liquid by reducing its interconnectivity. At low to moderate strain rates the sulphide <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> preserved a roundish shape, showing the liquid behavior is governed mainly by surface tension rather than by differential stress. Even at the highest strain rates, insignificant FeS segregation and interconnection were observed. On the other hand the basaltic melt was very mobile during deformation, accommodating part of the strain, which led to its segregation from the matrix at high bulk strains leaving the sulphide liquid stranded in the olivine matrix. Hence, we conclude that deformation-induced percolation of sulphide liquid does not contribute to the formation of planetary cores after the silicate solidus is overstepped. A possible early deformation enhanced core–mantle differentiation after overstepping the Fe–S solidus is not possible between the initial formation of silicate melt and the formation of a widespread magma ocean...|$|R

The overall size of the microreactor chip was 23 mm × 23 mm with a reaction channel dimension of 0. 6 mm (W) × 0. 3 mm (H) × 190 mm (L). A pillar structure (small rectangular posts of 60 μm (W) × 1 mm (L) 40 μm apart) was incorporated near the outlet of the reaction channel to retain the catalyst. The reaction was studied in the temperature range of 80 – 120 °C and at inlet pressures up to 5 bar(a). Benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity at 80 and 120 °C obtained in MPBRs were very close to those from conventional glass stirred reactors (GSRs) apart from the selectivity at 120 °C. Toluene was formed in the absence of oxygen, and its production was enhanced in the presence of oxygen. Increasing pressure improved both conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity. Mass transfer resistance in MPBRs was evaluated experimentally. The external mass transfer resistance could be ignored at a volumetric flow ratio of gas (STP) to liquid above 100, at a given liquid flow rate (0. 003 mL/min). The effect of catalyst particle size on the reaction was examined with two ranges of particle size: 53 – 63 μm and 90 – 125 μm.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work completed under NASA Grant NAG 5 - 8898 were (i) to document and characterize the low-albedo diffuse surfaces associated with triple bands and lenticulae, (ii) to determine their mechanisms of formation, and (iii) to assess {{the implications of these}} features for the resurfacing (in space and time) of the Europa {{and the nature of the}} Europan interior. The approach involved a combination of processing and analysis of Solid State Imaging data returned by the Galileo spacecraft during the primary and extended mission phases, together with numerical modeling of the physical processes interpreted to the observed features. We have modeled the formation of Europan triple explosive venting of cryoclastic material from bands and lenticulae halos by two processes: (i) a liquid layer in the Europan interior, and (ii) lag deposit formation by the thermal influence of subsurface cryomagmatic intrusions. We favor the latter hypothesis for explaining these features, and further suggest that a liquid water or brine intrusion is required to provide sufficient lateral heating of surface ice to explain the 25 km size of the largest features. (Solid ice diapirs, even under the most favorable conditions, become thermally exhausted before they heat significant lateral distances). We argue that water circulating in open fractures, or repeated cryomagmatic 'diking' events would provide sufficient thermal input to produce the observed features. Thus our work argues for the existence of a liquid beneath Europa's surface. Our results might most easily be explained by the presence of a continuous liquid layer (the putative Europan ocean); this would concur with the findings of the Galileo magnetometer team.

The stability of hydrates in a reservoir depends on many factors, including the interactions between minerals, surrounding fluids and hydrate.

SAG (Surfactant Alternating Gas) is a preferred method of injection as it results in greater injectivity in the field, but designing a successful process requires knowledge of foaming performance at very high foam qualities (gas fractional flows). Here the use of foam in low-permeability (~ 1 mD) Indiana Limestone cores for SAG foam applications is studied. Coreflood experiments were performed {{for a range of}} foam qualities at high pressure (100 bar), elevated temperature (55 °C), high salinity (200, 000 ppm) and in the presence of crude oil. The effectiveness of the foam was studied by differential pressure measurements along the core. Foam was still able to form under these stringent conditions, but it was a relatively weak foam (i. e. its ability to reduce gas mobility is modest). For one surfactant formulation, further analysis of the experimental results show that the foam would be able to maintain mobility control over the displaced phase, thus providing a stable displacement front, and that it {{can be used in a}} SAG foam process in these formations. For a second formulation the non-monotonic nature of the fractionalflow data require further investigation before scale-up to the field. In addition, further coreflood experiments were carried out using heterogeneous, vuggy Edwards White cores with even lower permeability (~ 0. 5 mD). These experiments were performed to determine whether foaming is possible in heterogeneous media and especially to investigate the effects of disconnected vugs on the foaming performance. CT scans were taken during the period of foam injection to determine saturation profiles within the core. Foam was able to form inside these cores, but inside the vugs foam segregation was observed with <b>liquid</b> <b>pockets</b> visible in the bottom of the vugs and gas in the remainder.

The fluid front tracking indicator “Free surface time exposure” has the units [cm 2 *s]. At each point of the free surface, the free surface area is multiplied by the time. This value is cumulated with the value of the previous timestep. In addition, this value is transported with the free surface and with the fluid flow. Experiments to validate this new functions were executed...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} structure and compositional variability {{of the upper}} martian crust is poorly understood. Optical and infrared measurements probe at most the top few cm of the surface layer and indicate the presence of layered volcanics and sediments, but {{it is likely that}} permafrost, hydrothermal deposits, and transient <b>liquid</b> water <b>pockets</b> occur at depths of meters to kilometers within the crust. An orbital synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide constraints on surface roughness, the depth of fine-grained aeolian or volcanic deposits, and the presence of strongly absorbing near-surface deposits such as carbonates. This information is crucial to the successful landing and operation of any rover designed to search for subsurface water. A rover-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can reveal layering in the upper crust, the presence of erosional or other subsurface horizons, depth to a permafrost layer, and direct detection of near-surface transient liquid water. We detail here the radar design parameters likely to provide the best information for Mars, based on experience with SAR and GPR in analogous terrestrial or planetary environments...|$|R
40|$|In this fluid {{dynamics}} video we show acoustic cavitation occurring from pits etched on a silicon surface. By immersing {{the surface in}} a <b>liquid,</b> gas <b>pockets</b> are entrapped in the pits which upon ultrasonic insonation, are observed to shed cavitation bubbles. Modulating the driving pressure {{it is possible to}} induce different behaviours based on the force balance that determines the interaction among bubbles and the silicon surface. This system can be used for several applications like sonochemical water treatment, cleaning of surfaces with deposited materials such as biofilms [1]. 1 Technical Details of the submitted video The experimental setup presented in Fig. 1, shows the components used to generate cavitation from micropits etched on silicon surfaces. The piezo is controlled by an amplified wave generator signal. This system can provide top and side views of the cavitation events provided by the nucleation of bubbles from artificial crevices etched into a smooth silicon surface. Chemical and most physical effects of ultrasound arise from the collapse of bubbles in a sonicated liquid. Improvements on sonochemical efficiency in microreactors have been reported recently using pits micromachined on a silicon surface [2]. The main advantage of this method is that the location of cavitation occurrence is known a priori, which allows a detailed study of several relevant aspects of sonochemistry, such as sonoluminescence an...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{problem of}} a jacket platform subjected to Wave-In-Deck load due to an extreme wave is studied numeri-cally by a CFD technique. In particular, details of local flow and slamming-like hydrodynamic impact on structural members are studied. The applied CFD code ComFLOW is a Navier-Stokes equation solver with an improved Volume of Fluid (iVOF) method employed to displace and re-construct fluids free surface. Two different fluid models, single-phase (liquid+void) and two-phase (liquid+compressible gas) can be used, the latter model being capable of simulating gas entrapped in <b>liquid.</b> Local air <b>pockets</b> are formed in corners and nooks of the struc-ture as the incoming wave front approaches. The study presents a comparison of hydrodynamic impact pressures found with and without the air entrapment. Numerical realisation of the two-phase model is considerably more expensive computationally and the study shows possibility and various aspects of its sim-ulation. Accuracy of the numerical solution and relevance of the air pocket formation on the impact pressures and therefore on the exerted structural load are discussed. ∗Address all correspondance to this author...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} explores {{aspects of}} the microbial ecology of Antarctica, focussing on the taxonomy and physiological attributes of Antarctic bacteria, as well as investigating the bacterial diversity of previously uncharacterised Antarctic environments. The University of Tasmania has in its possession a collection of 1600 Actinobacteria strains previously isolated from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic soils. A polyphasic study involving both phylogenetic and phenotypic comparisons was carried out to identify any potentially novel bacterial strains. Five isolates of interest were identified, belonging to the genera Arthrobacter, Promicromonospora, and Rhodococcus. Further studies revealed one Rhodococcus strain exhibited the ability to utilise an unusually wide range of hydrocarbons including both straight chain alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. During this study {{it was noted that}} members of the genus Streptomyces dominated this archive of Actinobacteria, and subsequent antimicrobial screening showed a range of potentially novel antimicrobial compounds effective against the food pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In addition to the characterisation of soil Actinobacteria, a preliminary look at the bacterial composition of several unique Antarctic environments was undertaken to explore ecological niches that may also play host to novel strains or interesting physiological abilities. Eight epiglacial lakes from the Framnes Mountains were compared using t-RFLP bacterial community profiling. These perennially frozen freshwater lakes possess alkaline waters up to pH 11 and have a similar chemical composition. The community structure differed from one lake to another, but each was dominated by Cyanobacterial with either Bacteriodetes group or Proteobacteria species and eukaryotic algae. To continue the characterisation of unique Antarctic sites, ice was chosen for study as it covers almost the entire continent and its surrounding coastline, with ancient glacial ice providing a snapshot into the past. Initially, marine ice accreted beneath the Amery Ice Shelf was examined for its microbial constituents. The bacteria trapped along this core were found to be heterogeneous, with some of the segments of ice possessing cultureable bacteria, revealing either the cryoprotective nature of some Antarctic bacteria found in low levels throughout the marine ice or that the ice contains <b>liquid</b> brine <b>pockets</b> which act as microhabitats. Following on from this work, ice from the Law Dome glacier dating back 115, 755, and 2467 years was investigated. The bacterial DNA recovered from the ice identifies bacterial members that may be useful in studies in evolution and adaptation. The results from this dissertation highlights the fact there is much still to be learnt about the microbial ecology of Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|A planned {{use of the}} Orion {{space vehicle}} {{involves}} its residence at the International Space Station for six months at a time. One concept of operations involves temporarily venting portions of the idle Orion active thermal control system (ATCS) during the docked phase, preventing freezing. The venting {{would have to be}} reasonably complete with few, if any, completely filled <b>pockets</b> of frozen <b>liquid.</b> Even if <b>pockets</b> of frozen <b>liquid</b> did not damage the hardware during the freezing process, they could prevent the system from filling completely prior to its reactivation. The venting of single component systems in a space environment has been performed numerous times and is well understood. Local nucleation occurs at warm, relatively massive parts of the system, which creates vapor and forces the bulk liquid out of the system. The remnants of the liquid will freeze, then evaporate over time through local heating. Because the Orion ATCS working fluid is a 50 / 50 mixture of water and inhibited propylene glycol, its boiling behavior was expected to differ from that of a pure fluid. It was thought that the relatively high vapor pressure water might evaporate preferentially, leaving behind a mixture enriched with the low vapor pressure propylene glycol, which would be vaporization]resistant. Owing to this concern, a test was developed to compare the evaporation behavior of pure water, a 50 / 50 mixture of water and inhibited propylene glycol, and inhibited propylene glycol. The test was performed using room temperature fluids in an instrumented thin walled stainless steel vertical tube. The 1 in x 0. 035 in wall tube was instrumented with surface thermocouples and encased in closed cell polyurethane foam. Reticulated polyurethane foam was placed inside the tube to reduce the convection currents. A vacuum system connected {{to the top of the}} tube set the pressure boundary condition. Tests were run for the three fluids at back pressures ranging from 1 to 18 torr. During each test, the mass of the test article was measured as it changed over time, as was its temperature and backpressure. The tests were successful. Somewhat surprisingly, the results showed that the evaporation behavior of the three fluids had more similarities than differences. The 50 / 50 mixture evaporated similarly to the pure water - albeit at a slower rate. The test results indicate that our extensive space - based experience with venting of single component fluids can be applied to the problem of Orion ATCS venting as long as the appropriate puts, takes, and caveats are applied...|$|R
40|$|Process {{intensification}} aims at {{the replacement}} of large, expensive, energy intensive processes to arrive at substantially smaller, more efficient, less costly and environmental friendly processes. The integration {{of two or more}} unit operations into single devices is the way to do this, as encountered in Catalytic Distillation where heterogeneously catalysed chemical reaction is combined with thermal separation in one shell. It presents the most significant class of multifunctional reactors/separators. Therefore to fit the needs of catalytic distillation processes modular arranged packings are developed to allow flexibility with regard to catalyst load in the column. The modular catalytic structured packing, MCSP, is build-up of alternating catalyst containing pockets (reaction section), with corrugated sheets (distillation section). Successful implementation requires solutions regarding enormous uncertainties that exist with reliable process design and scale-up. For these purposes the knowledge of hydrodynamics (dynamic liquid holdup, pressure drop and capacity) and mass transfer (HETP) characteristics imposed by the internal configuration is vital and lacking in open literature. To overcome this, the geometry based Delft MCSP Model, a parallel channel model, is developed to predict the hydrodynamic and mass transfer performance of Modular Catalytic Structured Packings (MCSP). The model performance is validated with pilot plant hydraulic (air/water) and total reflux distillation experiments carried out without reaction, for the base case Katapak SP, MCSP. Two different types were used, namely the MCSP- 11 and MCSP- 12, where the difference is the number of corrugated sheets sandwiched between the catalyst filled pockets, respectively 1 and 2. Three parallel flow channels are identified in the latter, the catalyst filled pockets, closed channels directly next to the pockets and open crossing flow channels {{in the middle of the}} distillation section. In the MCSP- 11 this reduces to two, the pockets and closed channels. Liquid Hold-upThe liquid hold-up is the basic flow parameter and the total hold-up in the MCSP packed bed is determined by two contributions, the so called internal and external hold-up. The internal operating hold-up is the amount of liquid flowing in the catalyst filled pockets and is bound between the static hold-up as lower end and the hold-up at the catalytic load point, i. e. complete saturation of the catalyst beds as upper end. The basic requirement is that the catalyst is fully employed which means to approximate plug flow through the catalyst bed and this is possible at liquid loads at or above the catalytic load point. Above the catalytic load point the excess liquid is retained in the distillation section of the packing and adds to the dynamic liquid hold-up in this section. Loading effects are incorporated and up to flooding the model agrees well with the experimental results. Pressure Drop The dense structure of the catalyst beds and pockets prevents vapour flow through this part of the MCSP. Therefore due to the low porosity these packings have a lower capacity and high pressure drops compared to conventional structured packing. As in corrugated sheet structured packing, the pressure drop in the open channels is determined by gas-gas interaction in the crossing flow channels, gas-liquid interaction at the interface along the channel and direction change related losses at the wall and at the transition between elements which are accompanied with entrance effects. In the closed channels is assumed that the flowing phases are not able to escape the channel within the packing height. In these channels gas-gas interaction is absent however due to the reaction section geometry halfway the element height (and at the top and bottom of the element) there is a flow diverging/converging zone causing variation in vapour velocity which is associated with a considerable energy losses. This friction is taken into account by a momentum based expression. In the model constant pressure over each cross section is assumed and to ensure this equality the vapour should be redistributed accordingly. Due to the geometrical differences between the flow channels encountered in parallel the effective vapour velocities are different and not known and therefore are iteratively calculated assuming a constant pressure drop and uniform liquid distribution. The pressure drop is predicted accurately well into the loading region. Mass Transfer Performance Vapour-liquid mass transfer takes place in the space filled with corrugated sheets, including the outer surface of the pockets, since here a vapour-liquid interface is available. In the Delft MCSP model the open channels behave as the flow channels in conventional structured packing. In the closed channels both liquid and vapour are forced to follow the channel to the end. Assuming a uniform liquid distribution all three walls of the triangular channel are wetted, i. e. maximum efficiency is expected, however in practice the liquid tends to flow in the form of rivulets along the lowest point of the channel. In this way a limited interface is available for contact with the ascending vapour causing a lower efficiency. In the model at the transition between packing layers it is assumed that the flowing phases are able to fully mix and this means that the concentration over the column cross section is uniform. Of each flow channel the change in concentration is calculated and mixed according to the flow contribution. Based on the average concentration the number of equilibrium stages per layer is determined and from this the HETP. Experimentally in the preloading region the MCSP generally shows a higher HETP than around loading. The difference in performance is mainly caused by maldistribution of liquid, namely bypassing of the <b>liquid</b> inside the <b>pockets</b> by the vapour and reduced lateral spreading due to these pockets which is especially seen in the MCSP- 11. The MCSPs exhibit their lowest attainable HETP around hydraulic loading of the packed bed where the model predictions agree with the experimental results. The Delft MCSP model takes all macro-geometry related effects properly into account without any adjustable parameters. It proved to be able to account correctly for geometrical variations and is well capable to predict the performance of MCSPs. With the model tailor made MCSP can be arranged to fit the needs (catalyst load/separation requirements) of a particulate catalytic distillation process and implementation of the model within a rigorous modelling environment should overcome some of the uncertainties associated with process design and scale-up.
