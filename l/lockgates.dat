25|$|At {{the end of}} 1916 a {{combined}} operation against Borkum, Ostend and Zeebrugge had been considered by Admiral Lewis Bayly, senior officer {{on the coast of}} Ireland. The plan was rejected due to the difficulty of supplying a landing force and the vulnerability of such a force to a land counter-attack; subsequent proposals were rejected for the same reasons. A bombardment of the Zeebrugge <b>lockgates</b> under cover of a smoke-screen, was studied by Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol and the Admiralty in late 1915 but was also rejected, because the risks were considered excessive. In 1916, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt proposed an attack to block Zeebrugge, which was rejected. Tyrwhitt proposed a more ambitious operation to capture the mole and the town, as a prelude to advancing on Antwerp. Bacon was asked to give his opinion and rejected the plan, as did the Admiralty.|$|E

50|$|The {{restored}} section {{would start}} near the Bradley Workshops of the Canal and River Trust {{at the end}} of the Wednesbury Oak Loop, where most of the <b>lockgates</b> for narrow canals are made. The only major obstacle is the road bridge carrying Bradley Lane over the canal near the workshops, which has been lowered. This would require re-alignment of the canal or the road. The rest of the route is free from development, and is protected by local planning agreements. The restoration route continues along the filled in Wednesbury Oak Loop, and along part of the Rotten Brunt line, which cut off a loop in the Wednesbury Oak Loop. It then follows the line of the Bradley Arm, descending through nine locks to reach the Walsall Canal, the top seven of which are filled in.|$|E
5000|$|A {{local group}} [...] working under IWAI's Boyne Navigation Branch is {{currently}} undertaking {{works on the}} Slane section of the navigation. Recent works which have taken place include: removal of thick vegetation growth on the waterway section (during Summer 2014) between Slane Lock (Lock 9) to a little beyond the Bridge that crosses the Boyne Navigation and River Boyne leading to Slane. Sluices were installed in the concrete barriers at Locks 8 and 9 at this section {{to allow for the}} rewatering of the waterway section and also allow for the regulation water levels. Once or were funding sourced, it would be hoped for the installation of <b>lockgates</b> at Lock 8 (Morgan's Lock) and Lock 9 (Slane Weir) allowing boat passage from the River Boyne to the other using the Boyne Navigation. A boat would do this by enter the double lock chamber at Lock 8 under the engineering feat of the man made archway (locally known as the Scabby Arch) under the stone arch road bridge to Slane up to Lock 9 and back out onto the River Boyne.|$|E

In 1944 an Act of Abandonment was passed by Parliament, stating that the waterway had not been used for some years.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} recorded marshman of {{the mill}} was a Mr Dan Banham, followed subsequently by Mr Bob Banham. The Banham family ceased working the mill in the early 1920s and was taken over {{for a short period}} by Mr Gordon Addison, who lived in the nearby <b>Lockgate</b> Farm. The final marshman that worked the mill was Mr Leonard Carter, who left the mill in the mid-1940s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lockgate</b> Mill also {{referred}} to locally and historically as Freethorpe Mill, 'Banham's Black Mill' and 'Duffel's Mill' is a windpump located on the Halvergate Marshes in the detached parish of Freethorpe within The Broads in the English county of Norfolk. It is approximately 2 mi west of Great Yarmouth, and 3 mi north-east of Berney Arms on {{the northern edge of}} Breydon Water. The structure is a Grade II listed building.|$|R
50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century and most of the twentieth, the Bassin de l'Arsenal was a {{commercial}} port where goods were loaded and unloaded. Separated from the Seine by the Morland <b>lockgate,</b> the port was converted into a leisure port in 1983 by a decision of the Mairie de Paris (Paris City Hall) and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and it is now run by the Association for the Leisure Port of Paris-Arsenal.|$|R
50|$|The current mill at this {{location}} was built somewhere between 1800 and 1825 {{under the name}} 'Freethorpe Mill', it is four stories high and built of red brick tarred black. The structure stands at 35 feet to the curb and {{the diameter of the}} base is 24 feet, housing two doors and 4 windows. A farm once stood next to the mill, it was known as <b>Lockgate</b> Farm and was demolished in 1981 after many years of being derelict.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} {{of the way in which}} the canals were built, and have {{subsequently}} been renamed,bridge numbering along the Llangollen Canal at Frankton Junction is not straightforward. The bridge to the east is numbered 69 (Peter's Bridge), then the bridge to the west of the junction (Rowson's Bridge) is numbered both 70 and 1. Further west, towards Llangollen, the bridge numbers continue as 2, 3, etc. Bridge number 71 (<b>Lockgate</b> Bridge) is located on what is now the Montgomery Canal, which uses bridge numbering starting with 71. The Llangollen Canal has, because of this, two separate series of bridge numbering, with one ending and the other beginning at Frankton Junction.|$|R
50|$|In 1847 the Eastern Branch was {{purchased}} by the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, and {{became part of the}} Shropshire Union network. In 1850 the Western Branch was also purchased by the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. Bridge numbers on the Montgomery sections of the canal continue on from the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal to reflect this. Today, bridge numbers on the Montgomery Canal continue on from Llangollen Canal bridge numbers at Frankton Junction, with the first bridge on the Montgomery Canal (<b>Lockgate</b> Bridge) being therefore bridge number 71 and not number 1; the numbering begins at distant Hurleston Junction. The Llangollen Canal has, because of this, two separate series of bridge numbering, with one ending and the other beginning at Frankton Junction.|$|R
40|$|The "classic" {{solution}} {{for the support of}} a translating <b>lockgate,</b> the wheelonrail support, has relatively high construction as well as inspection and maintenance costs. An alternative support which has previously been developed for use in the Prins WillemAlexander lock is the socalled "hydrosupport", a hydrostatic thrust bearing that slides on an elastic track and is connected to the <b>lockgate</b> by an elastic support. After a runningin period, this support shows low friction. In this thesis several methods to further improve this type of support have been studied. The direction of these improvements has been guided by the following observation: The typical dimensions and manufacturing standards of the bearing and the track are in conflict. On the large scale of a <b>lockgate,</b> a hydrostatic bearing typically requires sliding surfaces with a surface waviness smaller than 0. 1 mm/m. However, the track can not be manufactured easily with a surface waviness smaller than typically 0. 5 mm/m. This means that contact between the bearing and track will be inevitable. In this thesis, methods have been studied to use this contact in order to improve the performance (namely reduced flow rate and pumping power) of the hydrosupport. A mathematical model has been developed, incorporating the elastic deformation of the track, bearing and support, and the partial contact and hydrostatic lubricating film between the bearing and track. Several track waviness models have been developed, among others a random periodic surface waviness. Furthermore the concept of an "ideal" support has been introduced, which under compression exhibits a reaction pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure in a lubricating film with a constant height. Not only has this mathematical model been developed in this thesis, it has also been implemented in a numerical program and used to test the influence of a number of design parameters on the performance of a hydrosupport. It has been shown that, using the contact between the sliding surfaces, the tilting stiffness of a bearing with 1 small recess is comparable to that of the 4 -recess bearing. Additionally, a 1 recess bearing requires a smaller or even no restrictor and therefore a smaller supply pump. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the hydrofender with its large length/width ratio has comparable or even better performance than the circular hydrofoot, while requiring a narrower track. In addition, it has been shown that, for a given load, a hydrofender with a small bearing thickness and with a standard elastic support design exhibits a smaller flow rate and larger bearing coefficient than a bearing with an ideal support design. Finally, using the results of these parametric studies, a procedure has been developed for the design of hydrosupports. This procedure has been used in two examples.

5000|$|Stationed at , a Coastal Forces shore base in Gosport, he was {{involved}} {{with a plan to}} attack the German battleships [...] and [...] The plan involved a motor torpedo boat specially modified during construction by Vosper Thornycroft, the MTB 74, which was specially built to house torpedo tubes on its foredeck instead of midships. The mission would be to fire the modified torpedoes over the anti-submarine net in Brest harbour where they would sink to the sea-bed and explode after a time delay. The weapons were nicknamed 'Wynns weapons'. The MTB entered service in December 1941. However while this experiment was being trialled, the ships made a daring escape from Brest to the Baltic, nicknamed the [...] "Channel Dash". Left without a mission, MTB 74 was instead re-tasked to the St. Nazaire raid where it was proposed she could torpedo the inner caisson of the Normandy Dock or a <b>lockgate</b> to the Submarine Basin. Further tests were carried out prior to the raid on St Nazaire and adjustments made to the delayed-action mechanism of the torpedoes which were fired by MTB 74.|$|R
