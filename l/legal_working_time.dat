40|$|The {{transition}} to the 35 -hour working week was not just about reducing <b>legal</b> <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Sector and corporate negotiations covered working hours, their organisation, working conditions and wages. This paper analyses {{the impact of this}} transition on the time organisation of work and on employees work schedules. The findings are based on the use of INSEE working hours surveys of employees in 1995 and 2001, before and after the Aubry acts, and the shorter working week agreements monitoring file put together by the Ministry of Labour. Although the repetition of identical working weeks remains the norm, this mode has declined in firms that have shifted to 35 hours. The irregularity of days worked has grown more in industry than in the services. Irregular hours concern executives only. Conversely, the regular schedules organised over several weeks concern only the other employees, and first and foremost employees of small industrial enterprises.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research of Timberjack 240 C tractor equipped with double-drum winch Adler HY 16 in tree-length skidding method. The research was conducted in Euro-American poplar clearcut using time and work study method. Timber processing was done by teamwork of two fellers, one tractor driver and one feller-crosscutter (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The volume of 759. 03 m 3 was skidded in 88 cycles from an average skidding distance of 760 m. The average load volume was 8. 63 m 3, and it consisted of 5. 2 pieces with an average volume of 1. 66 m 3. During the research the tractor accomplished 68. 63 % of total time as effective time with delay time of 31. 37 % (Fig. 6). Travel unloaded accounted for 14. 39 % of total time, travel loaded 23. 91 %, felling site work 14. 33 % and landing work 16. 00 %. Daily output of 63. 25 m 3 /day was achieved with average total time consumption of 359. 32 min/day. The said total time consumption accounts for 78. 86 % of the <b>legal</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> (480 min). Variable times (travel loaded and unloaded by skid trails and landing, line pulling and winching) were analyzed by mathematical and statistical methods (Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10). All other effective times were regarded as fixed and calculated as averages of recorded time. In effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 600 m (skid trail) plus 150 m (landing), travel times account for 18. 14 min and felling site and landing work times account for 15. 91 min. The effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 600 m (+ 150 m), is 34. 05 min. With determined allowance time factor of 1. 30, total time is 44. 36 min. The average travel speed on skid trails is 6. 52 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 87 km/h for loaded tractor. The average travel speed on landing is 5. 61 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 73 km/h for loaded tractor (Table 2). The average speed of line pulling for the left drum is 0. 97 km/h and the average speed of winching is 1. 02 km/h. And for the right drum, the average speed of line pulling is 0. 94 km/h and the average speed of winching is 0. 85 km/h. (Fig. 3) Standard time of skidding ranges from 3. 71 min/m 3 (100 m) to 6. 29 min/m 3 (1000 m). The daily output for the average load volume ranges between 129. 52 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 100 m and 76. 34 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 1000 m. For skidding distances from 100 m to 1000 m, the skidding cost ranges from 22. 18 HRK/m 3 to 37. 63 HRK/m 3. The impact of different average load volumes on daily output and skidding cost is shown in Table 5 and Fig. 11. The results of this research show that Timberjack 240 C tractor belongs to a group of highly-efficient special forest timber skidding machines. The principle of load size effect, as one of the key factors of timber skidding, on skidding productivity in different skidding distances has been proven by this detailed research. Hence, by increasing the load volume and decreasing the average skidding distance, the productivity of this tractor is significantly increased, thus lowering the cost per unit...|$|E

The work site is situated on the altidude between 870 m and 1097 m. Harvesting density was 51. 86 m 3 /ha. Structure of growing stock was: 74. 29 % of fir, 22. 87 % of beech and 2. 84 % of other hard broadleaves. Ž. Zečić, D. Vusić, M. Prka, S. Klepac: UTJECAJ NAGIBATRAKTORSKOG PUTANAPROIZVODNOST [...] . Šumarski list br. 3 – 4, CXXXIV (2010), 103 - 114 Harvesting phases of felling and processing were time-separated from skidding. Research was conducted using time and work study method. Time consumption of each work component was measured by snap-back chronometry method. Lenght of skid roads was gradually measured on uniform slope segments by GPS. Coordinates of points, where the longitudal slope changes, were recorded by GPS as well. Slope of each individual segment was calculated using the difference in altitude of slope change points and the related lenght. While skidding, the tractor was travelling exclusively by two skid roads (figure 4 and table 1). Average skid slope is expressed in percents, in the direction of loaded tractor travel. Average slope of recorded turns was calculated by weighting the related slope with the travel lenght. Average skidding distance was calculated as an average of recorded loaded trevel lenghts of each turn. Load records are shown in table 2. Significant difference in average load on skid trail 1 (5. 043 m 3) and on skid trail 2 (3. 715 m 3) is evident. By each turn difference in productivity of skidding on skid road 1 and skid road 2 increases by 1. 328 m 3. During the research 75. 650 m 3 of beech wood asortments, and 115. 994 m 3 of fir wood asortments were skidded on skid road 1. On skid road 2 18. 607 m 3 of beech wood asortments an 44. 549 m 3 of fir wood asortments were skidded. By multiplying achieved volumes with density of fresh beech wood (1, 07 t/m 3) and fresh fir wood (0, 98 t/m 3) average load masses on skid road 1 (5. 122 t) and on skid road 2 (3. 739 t) were calculated. Variable times (travel loaded and unloaded by skid roads and landing, line pulling and winching) were analysed by mathematical and statistical methods (figure 6, figure 7 and figure 8). All other effective times were regarded as fixed and calculated as averages of recorded time (figure 11). During the research average daily output of 36. 40 m 3 /day was achieved with average total time consuption of 404, 59 min/day. The said total time consumption makes 84. 59 % of <b>legal</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> (480 min). With full utilisatin of <b>legal</b> <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> at the same organization of work, the productivity would increase by 15. 41 %. During the research the tractor accomplished 76. 46 % of total time as efective time with delay time of 23. 54 %. In effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, fixed times take 17. 36 min and variable times take 18. 97 min. Effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, is 36. 34 min. With determined allowance time factor of 1, 22 total time is 44. 42 min. Average travel speed on skid roads is 3. 56 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 50 km/h for loaded tractor. Average travel speed on landing is 4. 65 km/h for unloaded tractor and 4. 93 km/h for loaded tractor, on average distance of 65 m. Average speed of line pulling is 0. 97 km/h and average speed of winching is 0. 86 km/h. Standard time of skidding on skid road 1 ranges from 5. 32 min/m 3 (100 m) to 13. 17 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 5. 04 m 3. For skkiding on skid road 2 standard time ranges from 7. 22 min/m 3 (100 m) to 17. 88 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 3. 72 m 3. Daily output ranges from 90. 27 m 3 /day for skkidnig distance of 100 m to 36. 45 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 1000 m, when skkiding on skid road 1, and from 66. 50 m 3 /day to 26. 85 m 3 /day when skidding on skid road 2 for the same distances. For skidding distances from 100 m to 1000 m skidding cost ranges from 31. 83 kn/m 3 to 78. 83 kn/m 3, for skid road 1 and from 43. 20 kn/m 3 to 107. 01 kn/m 3 for skid road 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patters across 22 European countries. The focu was on three questions: how much mothers prefer to work, how much they {{actually}} work, and to what degree their preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are (in) consistent with each other. The focus was on cross-national differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, comparison of mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> to that of childless women and fathers, as well as on individual- and country-level factors that explain the variation between them. In the theoretical background, the departure point was an integrative theoretical approach where the assumption is that there are various kinds of explanations for the differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns – namely structural, cultural and institutional –, and that these factors are laid in two levels: individual- and country-levels. Data were extracted from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2010 / 2011. The results showed that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, both preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> varied across European countries. Four clusters were formed to illustrate the differences. In the full-time pattern, full-time work was the most important form of work, leaving all other <b>working</b> <b>time</b> forms marginal. The full-time pattern was perceived in terms of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times</b> in Bulgaria and Portugal. In polarised pattern countries, full-time work was also important, but it was accompanied by a large share of mothers not working at all. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> many Eastern and Southern European countries followed it whereas in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> it included all Eastern and Southern European countries as well as Finland. The combination pattern was characterised by the importance of long part-time hours and full-time work. It was the preferred <b>working</b> <b>time</b> pattern in the Nordic countries, France, Slovenia, and Spain, but Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, and Sweden followed it in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The fourth cluster that described mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was called the part-time pattern, and it was illustrated by the prevalence of short and long part-time work. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> it was followed in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Besides Belgium, the part-time pattern was followed in the same countries in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The consistency between preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was rather strong in a majority of countries. However, six countries fell under different <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns when preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> were compared. Comparison of working mothers’, childless women’s, and fathers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> showed that differences between these groups were surprisingly small. It was only in part-time pattern countries that working mothers worked significantly shorter hours than working childless women and fathers. Results therefore revealed that when mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are under study, an important question regarding the population examined is whether it consists of all mothers or only working mothers. Results moreover supported the use of the integrative theoretical approach when studying mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns. Results indicate that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns in all countries are shaped by various opportunities and constraints, which are comprised of structural, cultural, institutional, and individual-level factors.

40|$|Excerpt] Working {{time is a}} {{recurrent}} topic of study because the nature of work, its content, {{the conditions under which}} it is performed and the labour market itself keep changing. These changes have an impact on <b>working</b> <b>time</b> duration and the way <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is organised. One of the manifest results is the erosion of a clear demarcation between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and non-working time – the work and private sphere. The European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is among the sources that have clearly established the link between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns and the health and wellbeing of workers. Eurofound’s research on job quality shows that <b>working</b> <b>time</b> quality is one of the crucial contributing elements. ]This report examines <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns in more detail. It provides an overview of the recent evolution of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> duration and organisation in the EU and highlights the most important trends and differences between Member States. Through an in-depth analysis of data from the sixth EWCS (2015), it also examines, from a gender and life course perspective, the links between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, work–life balance and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> preferences {{on the one hand and}} workers’ health and well-being, on the other. Finally, it explores the implications of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns for the longterm sustainability of work...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{labor market}} is {{characterized}} by flexibility. This applies to organizations, forms of employment and <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is such an adaptation and the main subject of this essay. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the conditions that underpin unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> in relation to the Swedish legislation and to EU legislation. The intention has been to investigate the work environment impacts of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> and what differences there are from a gender perspective. The conclusion is that workers who enter into agreements for unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> have significantly different terms from traditional workers. Workers with unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> are exempted from the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> law and so even the provided safety net. A frequent part in agreements of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> also means that the employee agrees to an elimination of compensation for overtime work. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is appropriate for workers who have working tasks that they can adjust to their <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Workers with controlled working tasks have not the same opportunity, which increases the risk of perceived ill health. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is therefore not suitable for all forms of employment. More scientific research is needed in this area, but based on the available scientific research, there are indications to suggest that women are overrepresented among those occupations. It would then also mean that womenare at greater risk of ill health than men...|$|R
40|$|Institute for Employment Research has {{developed}} a detailed <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and volume of work measurement concept in order to more comprehensively assess the demand for labor. The individual components of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> in Germany are obtained from various data sources and combined to form the paid volume of work. The IAB's measurement concept of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is a quarterly calculation; calculation depth is based on six economic sectors further broken down for calculation. of specific components. The basis for determining average actual <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and volume of work {{is the number of}} wage and salary earners, self-employed people, and unpaid family workers. The point of departure for determining <b>working</b> <b>time</b> of wage and salary earners is the number of potential working days. Collectively agreed or customary <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is the most influential component in the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> calculation, independent of the economic situation. Other components are sick leave; paid overtime; short-time work; <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts; bad weather, strikes, and accepted part-time work; secondary employment; and components to increas...|$|R
40|$|To be able {{to combine}} work with {{activities}} and duties outside the workplace successfully, employees need time adequacy. Time adequacy is the fit between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and all other time demands and can be achieved through <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy. However, past {{research has shown that}} <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy do not necessarily foster employees' time sovereignty. Studies suggest that the benefits of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements depend on work organization. Analyzing performance-related pay, target setting and self-directed teamwork as moderators for <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements and time adequacy is therefore the main interest of the study. The data used is taken from the European Survey of Working Conditions in 2010. Multi-level analyses show that <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy, as well as self-directed teamwork, are positively associated with time adequacy. However, employees experience time squeeze with performance-related pay and target setting. Moreover, performance-related pay undermines the positive effect of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy. The study indicates that management practices have distinct connotations for time adequacy. Moreover, wage flexibility limits employees' benefits from <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> (reduction) on wages and unemployment. Using a union bargaining framework, I show that <b>working</b> <b>time</b> reduction leads to wage moderation in terms of annual remuneration. This result is independent of the bargaining regime, as it holds for the right-to-manage model and for the efficient bargaining model. As a result, the relation between hourly wages and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> {{is likely to be}} U-shaped. The level of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> where {{the impact of}} hours on hourly wages changes sign, is typically higher than the individual hours supply, unless the latter is strongly upward sloping. Extending these partial equilibrium results to the general equilibrium, this also leads to a U- shaped relation between equilibrium unemployment and working time: For relatively long <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> a reduction in <b>working</b> <b>time</b> will decrease the unemployment rate; whereas unemployment may increase for shorter <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> ...|$|R

All employers are required to keep government Form I-9 documents on all employees and some states mandate the use of the federal E-Verify program to research the working status of Social Security numbers. With increased concern for right-to-work issues, many outsourcing companies are sprouting in the marketplace to help automate and store Form I-9 documentation.

40|$|Competitive {{conditions}} are leading to much experimentation within and decentralization of the German employment relations system. In this aritcle, I show how flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> {{is an integral}} part of the German employment relations system and how flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements are contributing to its transformation. In addition, I discuss the implications for employers and employees of flexible <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> and the lessons the German experience with flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> has for the United States. Flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> contributes to the decentralization of German employment relations on multiple levels, particularly within the enterprise. The benefits to employers of flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> take many forms and are generally positive, whereas the implications for employees are more mixed. The main lesson for the United States is that labor market insitutions still matter in developing flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> models that can meet both employer and employee needs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements in Bulgaria, using a life-course perspective. Two important features have to be outlined, namely: underdeveloped flexible forms of employment in the country, including <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangement, and lack of previous analysis on flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements from the angle of life-course perspective. The author describes the regulatory framework, collective agreements at national and company level as a frame within which different forms of flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangements by gender develop. The study points out that there are no significant gaps concerning work engagement under different <b>working</b> <b>time</b> schemes. It is mentioned that the existing legal frame gives relatively good opportunities for the flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangement to be in practice. However, crossing the issue of flexibility in <b>working</b> <b>time</b> arrangement with <b>working</b> life cycle, the author outlines more gender differences, e. g. more young people in flexible types of employment; more women employed part-time, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|Actually {{paid and}} unpaid {{overtime}} {{as well as}} transitory overtime are widespread in Germany. They are used as instruments to increase <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility. With {{the increasing use of}} <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts the importance of transitory overtime increased, whereas paid overtime lost in importance. In the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> calculations of the Institute for Employment Research overtime and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts are important components to measure the actual <b>working</b> <b>time</b> of employees. So far, only paid overtime is integrated in the calculations because valid data for unpaid overtime hardly exist. Furthermore, transitory overtime can only be estimated until now. However, the use of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts in the economy is well covered using various data sources. This research report gives insight into available data sources and describes possibilities to use them for analyzing overtime and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts. There are differences between these data sets with respect to the extent and the covered time period of the data. Overall there are some possibilities to use these additional data for the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> calculations.

Drawing on gender theory and welfare state theory, gender differences and the institu-tional contexts of the UK, Sweden, Germany and the Nether-lands are taken into account. The study reveals that time ar-rangements have gendered meanings. While <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy are positively related to time adequa-cy for women, men tend to experience overtime and work in-tensification in connection with <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy. Fur-thermore, <b>working</b> <b>time</b> regimes also shape time arrange-ments. In the UK, employees have time adequacy primarily when they work fixed hours, while in the Netherlands, em-ployees profit most from <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy.
