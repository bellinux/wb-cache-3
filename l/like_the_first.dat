5|$|Just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{album of}} the trilogy, Bat Out of Hell II was a huge {{commercial}} success and sold over 14 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Marshalsea, {{the second}} was {{notoriously}} cramped. In 1827, 414 out of its 630 debtors were there for debts under £20; 1,890 people in Southwark were imprisoned that year for a total debt of ₤16,442.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
50|$|At {{the film}} review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes, 47% of 975 viewers <b>liked</b> <b>The</b> <b>First</b> Monday in October. The film carries an average rating of 3.1/5.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> {{assignment}} Tainy {{received from}} Luny, {{was to see}} if he really had what it took. Luny <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> song he worked on so much that he ended up using it for Mas Flow 2.|$|R

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> film, the {{production}} of Jaws 2 was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film {{and was replaced by}} Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.|$|E
5|$|Synagogues <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Roumanian-American Congregation, more familiarly {{known as}} the Rumanische shul, were the first spiritual homes for {{successive}} waves of European immigrants. They were built more than 100 years ago, and just like the bridges and tunnels of New York City, they're bound to fail if not attended to.|$|E
5|$|Wales next won the Five Nations {{outright}} in 1975, and in 1976, Wales {{won their}} second Grand slam of the decade. Just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in 1971, they only used 16 players over their four matches. They repeated the feat in 1978 and, in the process, {{became the first}} team to win three consecutive Triple Crowns. Following their final Five Nations match of 1978, both Phil Bennett and Gareth Edwards retired from rugby.|$|E
5000|$|... "Despite all {{the seeming}} action, the story moves slowly. Flashes of humor help things along, though, and readers who <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> book will enjoy the new entries in feisty Claidi's journal {{while waiting for}} the next installment." [...] -Booklist ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Dessa said, [...] "I {{felt a little}} more confident in my ability, and I knew that some people in Minneapolis had <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> project, so I felt a little more confident in my attack." ...|$|R

5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> record, {{was very}} much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|Isaac and Miria {{appear in}} the series' two drama CDs; they survive the Flying Pussyfoot {{incident}} in 1931 Local Chapter ・ Express Chapter The Grand Punk Railroad and hope to meet true revolutionaries in a small Mexican village in Firo Prochainezo witnesses the 53rd death of Pietro Gonzalez. The pair are also playable characters in the Baccano! video game and are characters in the two-volume manga; <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> drama CD, the video game and manga adaptations recount the events aboard the Pussyfoot. The pair have also made a brief appearance in an episode of the Durarara!! anime series, voiced by Sam Riegel and Jennie Kwan in the English dub, during which they are in modern-day Ikebukuro, Tokyo and attend {{the first meeting of}} the Dollars, an anonymous online gang.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the goal}} was to three points <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round.|$|R

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Kingdom Hearts, Chain of Memories {{was adapted}} into a manga by Shiro Amano, {{following}} the same plot as the video game. It was serialized in Square's Monthly Shōnen Gangan in Japan, then released in two volumes in Japan {{and later in the}} United States by TOKYOPOP. The first volume was released in Japan on October 22, 2005. A year later, it was released in English on October 10, 2006, followed by the second volume on February 6, 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Ridge Racer, {{the player}} {{normally}} starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga '88 {{instead of the}} original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game, Izuna 2 {{focuses on}} the adventures of Izuna and her friends. Shino, Izuna's friend, disappears {{in the midst of}} a wedding, so Izuna goes on a quest to find her. Izuna finds her, only to {{discover}} that Shino was looking for her sister, Shizune, so Izuna and her group decide to help search for Shizune. But by looking for Shizune, Izuna angers a group of foreign gods, who attempt to prevent her from reuniting with Shizune.|$|E
50|$|<b>Like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> edition, <b>the</b> Liga EBA teams played <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{round with}} a single-legged {{round-robin}} format.|$|R
2500|$|... (2001), a direct-to-video sequel {{that still}} {{features}} <b>the</b> Claremont House <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> film.|$|R
50|$|A duel with Sparksters arch rival Axel Gear occurs, much <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game.|$|R
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 {{was shot}} in Vancouver. The Corkscrew roller coaster at Playland was {{the basis of the}} Devil's Flight. Winstead and Merriman {{said in an interview that}} the film required three months of shooting; the first two weeks were spent on filming the roller-coaster scene, and the rest of the film was shot out of sequence. The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods do {{not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} was mostly negative, with JoBlo.com stating the film was [...] "too routine, uninspired, badly shot and cheap to deliver as a satisfying Night of the Demons sequel". Deseret News panned the film, writing it was [...] "another sequel to a horror movie no one <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time around".|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Philbert Dy of Clickthecity.com <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> film's <b>first</b> half, but disliked the second half.|$|R
5000|$|The opening credits {{are set to}} Apache Indian's song [...] "Boom Shack-A-Lak", just <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> film.|$|R
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution {{features}} two hidden modes; 'Drift Contest', where {{points are}} earned {{according to how}} well spins are performed on certain corners, and 'Pretty Racer' (also known as 'Buggy mode'), in which the cars size appears with deformed body sizes, similar to Choro-Q cars, {{which led to the}} arcade game Pocket Racer. Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game, a music CD can be inserted and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played is loaded into the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, {{there was}} a group of monastic cathedrals in which the bishop was titular abbot. These cathedrals are Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester, Winchester and Worcester. These monasteries were Benedictine except in the case of Carlisle, which was Augustinian. Six of these churches were built from the start as cathedrals. Carlisle and Ely are purely monastic churches, which then became the seat of a bishop during the course of construction. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, all the {{previously}} monastic cathedrals became governed by secular canons <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> group.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{illustrated}} by sci-fi/fantasy artist Michael Whelan, following {{the style of}} Richard Corben's cover for Bat Out of Hell. It features the biker from the first cover flying on his motorcycle towards a giant bat perched on top of New York City's Chrysler Building, to which an angel is bound. Echoing the gravestones of the first cover, partially destroyed skyscrapers inhabit the lava landscape. Also <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> album, it features a 'Songs by Jim Steinman' credit, although smaller and located {{at the bottom of}} the cover.|$|E
50|$|Lobo {{explains}} his philosophy behind {{his job at}} leading <b>the</b> firm, <b>like</b> this: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> step is always to listen.|$|R
5000|$|BICS refers {{primarily}} to context-bound, face-to-face communication, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> language <b>first</b> learned by toddlers and preschoolers, {{which is used}} in everyday social interaction.|$|R
5000|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} factor in whether someone will like another is how much they believe <b>the</b> other person <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> person. An experiment tested this by pairing college students together. Both groups received different types of special information. One group was told their partner <b>liked</b> them and <b>the</b> other group was told their partner disliked them. The [...] "liked" [...] group was much friendlier to each other and argued less.|$|R
