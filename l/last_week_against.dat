(Hearst, the newspaper publisher who was the 1905 Mayoral candidate of the Municipal Ownership League, and Hylan, who had started life operating subway trains, were both strong opponents of the city's private transit companies.) Hylan's position on the war was unclear, but not his sharp victory over all three of his major rivals on November 6 (exactly seven months after the U.S. Declaration of War and one day before the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia). Although a divided opposition let Hylan carry the City and three of her boroughs with less than 50% of the total vote, the numbers (as in 1897) suggest that Tammany Hall might very easily have won a two-candidate race.|$|E
5000|$|Tebow, return man Brandon James and Florida's defense {{gave the}} Vols fits {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. Tebow completed 14 of 19 passes for 115 yards, although he also had two turnovers that Tennessee turned into 10 points. James returned three kickoffs for 97 yards, helping set up Florida's first 13 points, but he also dropped a pass in the end zone. And the defense harassed Jonathan Crompton and twice held the Vols to short field goals when they were in position for touchdowns. Ahmad Black intercepted Crompton on fourth down with about 2 minutes to play, ending Tennessee's last chance at pulling off the upset. [...] "I'm not happy," [...] said Crompton, who threw three interceptions and fumbled a snap <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>against</b> UCLA. [...] "Don't want to lose if you're a competitor. Hate losing more than you like winning. Look at the positives. Got a chance to capitalize early and late." [...] Tebow took over down the stretch. After his two nifty, 4-yard runs, the Gators looked like they would put the game away. But Tebow fumbled at the Vols 4, and Tennessee scored seven plays later to make it 23-13. It was Tebow's second turnover of the game. He threw an interception in the first half that Tennessee turned into a field goal. The Gators had some excuses for their lackluster offense. Receiver Deonte Thompson missed the game because of a hamstring injury. Running back Jeff Demps played with a 101-degree fever. And tight end Aaron Hernandez had to be isolated Friday because of flu-like symptoms. Meyer put it all on Tebow, who ran 24 times.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the 1973-74 season, he {{was traded}} to the Portland Trail Blazers. In 69 games he {{averaged}} just under 30 minutes per game, averaging a new career-best 13.5 ppg to go with 10.2 rpg. An early-season article in Sports Illustrated stated of Roberson, [...] "Despite being one of the NBA's shortest centers, and perhaps its lightest, he has been the Blazer most responsible for the team's turnabout[...] [...] Roberson has already missed five entire games, plus all but three minutes of another, with a leg injury. In his absences, Portland's record is 2-4. With Roberson on full-time duty, the Blazers are 5-1, the only loss coming <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the streaking Bulls, who made Portland their 11th straight victim. No center has scored more than 14 points against Roberson, and more important, his Dave Cowens-like quickness and agility at stepping out from the middle and pop-switching on smaller, supposedly faster men have allowed the Blazers to employ an aggressive switching defense. In games started by Roberson, Portland has given up an average of 102 points, 10.3 fewer than last season. 'I'd be bulljiving myself if I thought I could stand in the middle and block a lot of shots the way the real big dudes do,' says Roberson. 'I've got to come out and play the small guys. You know, face-to-face. I got to get up on 'em and spread out so they can't drive by or pass around me to the big guy I've switched off. Being active like that means that I have to take some risks with my body. I don't think I'm injury prone. It's just the way I play that causes me to get hurt sometimes'." [...] On February 12, 1974, he exploded for a new career-high 37 points in one game against the Phoenix Suns.|$|E
50|$|LaDainian Tomlinson {{made history}} by {{becoming}} the fastest {{running back to}} reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexanders single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexanders mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222 yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denvers Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter {{to make it a}} 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elams 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Bengals, the Chargers wouldnt say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummers 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen. The Broncos hopes for overtime ended when Plummer was sacked by Shaun Phillips and time ran out, giving San Diego their first win in Denver in 7 years as well as sole position of first place in the AFC West and improved their record to 8-2.|$|E
5000|$|Mertesacker made five {{appearances}} in December, missing only {{the trip to}} Olympiacos in the Champions League and the home win over Newcastle United. On being drawn against Bayern Munich in the Champions League round of 16, he said, [...] "We will face a good team in Germany. They are top of their league and went through to the knockout stage in a phenomenal way. They only conceded seven goals {{in the first half}} of the season. But they have a little break now and can rest a bit. Maybe it's a good opportunity for us to face them in February because we will be in our rhythm. We will hopefully go through the Christmas period in a strong way. We can do that." [...] Mertesacker captained Arsenal for the first time in the FA Cup win over Brighton & Hove Albion in January, and appeared in every game save for the draw at Southampton on New Year's Day. [...] "We are always looking to win something and we can achieve something with this group," [...] he told Arsenal. [...] "We have a lively group so our thoughts are now on the next match. That's the most important thing for us, not what's going to happen in May. We have a few targets in our team that are possible this year. We won't talk about it, we'll just see what happens in the next few important weeks on the pitch." [...] Mertesacker started four games in February, missing only the FA Cup loss to Blackburn at the Emirates. [...] "It's always special to face a German team," [...] the defender said ahead of the Champions League tie against Bayern. [...] "and Lukas Podolski are looking forward to it because Bayern are a great team and are so consistent this year. It's a special game for German players to play against a team from their home country."Mertesacker was a mainstay in March, playing every single minute of Arsenal's four games. The centre back was on target in the defeat at Tottenham and was a key component in the defence that kept clean sheets against both Bayern Munich and Swansea City. [...] "It rained cats and dogs, especially in the second half," [...] he said after the win in south Wales, in Swansea. [...] "It was very slippery but it was a vital win." [...] In April, Mertesacker was shown a red card at West Bromwich Albion for the first game of the month. The defender returned to the team after suspension and was named man of the match against Fulham after scoring the only goal away at Craven Cottage. [...] "I think they've been terrific - not only defending very well but also creating goals for us at the other end like they did <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Fulham," [...] said goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny on the partnership between Mertesacker and Koscielny. [...] "They're getting the credit they deserve because they work very hard and they're very honest lads. I'm very happy for them and it's much easier to play behind them when they are in that kind of form." ...|$|E
25|$|A rare lunchtime {{kick-off}} was {{the scene}} of Napoli's visit to the Tardini, just the second home game the Crociati had had in a run of seven. Napoli had won four in a row before this game, but they were dominated by an impressive Parma performance. Gianluca Musacci, however, appear to have tripped Edison Cavani in the penalty area late on in the second half, although replays suggested that Cavani tripped over his feet. He picked himself up to take the penalty, had it saved by Mirante, but was quickest to react to poke it home to give Napoli the lead. The parallels with <b>last</b> <b>week's</b> penalty <b>against</b> Genoa were strong: the referee's decision was questionable and Mirante saved, but could only push it into the taker's path. Parma continued to dominate in the second half and should have had a penalty for an Andrea Dossena handball, but eventually scored through Cristian Zaccardo's tap-in with not long left to go. As Parma pressed for the winner, Napoli broke and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored, although replays suggest he was offside.|$|R
50|$|Week 6 - Daina (4-4): After winning <b>last</b> <b>week's</b> weigh-in <b>against</b> {{the five}} couples, sisters Caitlin and Daina were both below the yellow {{line for the}} first time without holding immunity.

Phoebe decided to change sides against the Firm and voted with Jarna, Lisa and Shannon for strategic reasons (to eliminate the bigger threat), not believing the Firm will stick to their word to protect her. In the end, the vote was hung at 4-4 and since Daina had the lowest percentage weight loss, she was eliminated. After the votes were read, Caitlin commented that she wanted nothing more to do with those that voted against her (particularly Phoebe, whom she felt she had tried to include as part of the Firm), but later apologised, stating that she didn't want to be an angry and defensive person any more. Phoebe voted against Caitlin for strategy and believed it was the right move to make in the end.|$|R
40|$|Intraperitoneal {{injection}} of chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose (COAM) protected mice against mengo, vaccinia, Semliki Forest, and influenza APR 8 viruses. Topical {{administration in the}} eye of rabbits partially inhibited the development of experimental herpetic keratoconjunctivitis. COAM resembled polyacrylic acid in many aspects, but it was markedly less toxic. For systemic administration, the therapeutic index was on the order of magnitude of 1 : 300 to 1 : 500. Although the in vivo antiviral effect of COAM wore off faster than that of polyacrylic acid, protection <b>lasted</b> for several <b>weeks.</b> <b>Against</b> mengovirus, such prolonged protection was achieved only when polymer and virus were injected intraperitoneally. Protection against intravenous vaccinia virus was not dependent on the injection route of COAM. Experiments on the mode of action of COAM pointed to macrophages as possible mediators of the antiviral effect. The fact that small amounts of interferon appeared in the serum after administration of high doses of COAM suggests that interferon {{may play a role in}} the induction of antiviral resistance by COAM...|$|R
5000|$|November {{started with}} the East Midlands derby against Derby County at Pride Park Stadium, {{the first time the}} two teams had met in a {{competitive}} fixture in over three years. The match proved to be controversial, with Emanuel Villa scoring at both ends to make the score 1-1. Lewis McGugan was given a straight red card, then a 93rd-minute penalty for Derby was saved by former Ram Lee Camp, with manager Colin Calderwood commenting after that the save would go down in the folklore. Veteran striker Andrew Cole then had his contract cancelled by [...] "mutual consent" [...] after the ex-Manchester United forward had fallen out with the club, as he was often being left on the bench. Forest followed up the Derby draw with another 1-1 draw at home to promotion-chasing Birmingham City and then a 2-2 draw away to Bristol City; the latter match saw Camp save another injury-time penalty and a point, seeing Forest into a four-game unbeaten run. However, they then lost 2-1 at home to Norwich City to return {{to the bottom of the}} table. A further 0-0 away draw at relegation rivals Doncaster Rovers saw mass tabloid speculation that manager Colin Calderwood was set to be replaced by Billy Davies. In the next game, at home to Barnsley, Forest won by a 36th-minute header from Joe Garner, moving off the foot of the table to 23rd. Forest drew 2-2 at Coventry City, twice coming from behind to claim a point, but their poor home form continued with a 1-0 home loss to Sheffield United and a 0-0 draw against relegation rivals Blackpool. Forest then recorded an important victory away at Southampton, with defender Wes Morgan scoring his first goal of the season and Joe Garner chipping the goalkeeper from 35 yards. This took Forest to just one point off safety, with their next game at home to bottom-of-the-table Doncaster Rovers, but Forest were 4-0 down within an hour and down to ten men for much of the second half after Julian Bennett came off injured after Forest had used all their substitutions, with a cruciate-ligament injury ruling the left-back out for the rest of the season. Forest replied with two late goals, but immediately after the game the Forest board terminated manager Colin Calderwood's contract after two and a half years in charge of the club; assistant manager David Kerslake was also dismissed. Reserve-team manager John Pemberton took caretaker charge at Norwich City, which Forest won 3-2 to rise out of the relegation zone for the first time in three months; this game saw the end of Lee Camp's loan spell. On 1 January, Nottingham Forest appointed Billy Davies as their new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal with David Kelly named as his assistant manager. Davies watched the next match, against nouveau-riche Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, which saw Forest won 3-0 with goals from strikers Nathan Tyson, Robert Earnshaw and Joe Garner. Davies' first game in charge saw Forest go to bottom of the table Charlton Athletic and beat the strugglers 2-0, with Tyson and Earnshaw netting for the Reds. Their third victory in a row pushed Forest up to 21st and moved them closer to teams directly above them. A 2-0 home win Plymouth Argyle moved them into 20th before a big rival match in the FA Cup against Derby County at Pride Park, which ended 1-1. There will be a replay on 4 February at the City Ground. This was followed up by a 2-1 home win against Sheffield Wednesday, in which Forest came from behind to win. The result put them 17th, four points clear of the relegation zone. February saw just one win for Forest at the end of the month against promotion chasing Reading. Forest lost their opening game of February to local rivals Derby in the FA Cup. Forest then drew 1-1 with QPR before going on a three-game losing streak to Birmingham City, Ipswich Town and Derby this time in the league. After the bitter disappointment of picking up just one victory in February, Forest were looking to get off to the best possible start, and they did against Preston in a 2-1 victory with a brace from Rob Earnshaw sending Forest three places up the table into 18th and looking a lot less likely to face the drop after another good result this time a 1-1 draw to Swansea City. However another three game losing streak to Watford, a 5-0 loss to Burnley and then a 1-0 defeat to Wolves thanks to a Michael Kightly goal saw Forest take another dramatic downturn and they slipped in the league table to the regulation place of 22nd. Forest knew that with just six games left to stay in the Championship they needed something special. After a 1-1 draw against Barnsley following a desperate equaliser from Rob Earnshaw, Forest still sat in the drop zone. Up next were Bristol City, when city went ahead through Ivan Sproule things looked bleak again at the City Ground. Rob Earnshaw again showed his fantastic ability to score vital goals after grabbing an equaliser but with twelve minutes to go Forest went 2-1 down thanks to Dele Adebola. Forest turned things round in a fantastic comeback, Joe Garner making it 2-2 and then in stoppage time on loan Dexter Blackstock grabbed the late winner to give Forest a vital three points and climb themselves out of the drop zone. A midweek match against Sheffield United followed the fantastic win against City but it was a dull affair. After Kelvin Wilson was sent off early on, Forest's best chance fell to Joe Garner who fired over the crossbar and the Red's had to settle for a 0-0 draw that put them back into the drop zone on goal difference with Barnsley. Coventry City was the next opponents Forest had to face. Forest seemed more likely too pick up a result as the match was at the City Ground following the hysterics <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Bristol City. And the only goal from James Perch after 46 minutes gave Forest a well-deserved win sending them up to 20th and out the drop zone, however they could not be complacent yet as both Norwich City and Barnsley, the two teams behind them had games in hand. Following the draw at Coventry, Forest saw that both Barnsley and Norwich failed to pick up a result that threatened Forest's safety. The early kick off saw on 25 April saw Forest hold Blackpool to a 1-1 draw at Bloomfield Road. Barnsley played Wolves and looked to have won what was a vital game however a late equaliser for Wolves saw Forest with a chance to stay up if Norwich were to lose to Reading. And they did, two goals from Shane Long meant Forest had escaped the drop. On the final day Forest beat already relegated Southampton 3-1 and secure 19th place just behind rivals Derby County.|$|E
