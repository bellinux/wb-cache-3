5|$|Nunn {{obtained}} {{the first eight}} years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park. During his teenage years, he gave himself a hernia while <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> heavy piece of farm equipment. This, combined with his father's health history, {{may have contributed to}} back pain issues that plagued him for most of his life. In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Bowling Green Business University, now Western Kentucky University.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} figure at the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|According to Malhotra, most of {{the action}} stunts in the film were shot by Roshan and Dutt themselves, while body doubles were used to film a few scenes. Several {{accidents}} {{took place during the}} filming of Agneepath. Priyanka Chopra's lehenga caught fire, while shooting for an elaborate Ganpati festival song. Hrithik Roshan too scalded his hands while shooting for the same scene. Roshan also suffered from an eye injury during the shoot of a song, when holi colours were flung into his eyes by some junior artists. In October, Roshan suffered from a major back injury while <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> man weighing 110 kilograms, which was a part of an elaborate action sequence. Shooting was stalled for some time following the incident, while Roshan recuperated in a hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Especially at ski areas, {{chairlifts}} {{are referred}} to with a ski industry vernacular. <b>A</b> one-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "single", <b>a</b> two-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "double", <b>a</b> three-person <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> “triple”, four-person <b>lifts</b> are “quads”, and <b>a</b> six-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "six pack". If the <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> detachable chairlift, it is typically referred to as <b>a</b> “high-speed” <b>lift,</b> which results in a “high-speed quad” or “high-speed six pack”.|$|R

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and <b>lifting.</b> <b>A</b> problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|Logona Esau {{qualified}} for weightlifting via {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class. Born in the South Pacific island nation of Nauru in 1987, Esau was 21 {{years old at the}} time of his participation in his Beijing event. He was the most experienced and decorated of the three Tuvaluan athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania in that particular competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102kilograms, 107kilograms, and 110kilograms successively. During the clean and jerks, Esau successfully lifted 138kilograms, then 144kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254kilograms. This ranked the Tuvaluan in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> combined 348kilograms.|$|E

50|$|One highly {{effective}} {{method of scoring}} involved scissor <b>lifts.</b> <b>As</b> there was no upper-end cap on the crate stacking bonus (see below) several teams built 10-18-foot scissor lifts that would <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> crate, scoring 200-400 points. This score was virtually impossible to beat {{without the use of}} another scissor lift.|$|R

25|$|A {{comparison}} with the Plane 2 West (Stanhope) which had a 72-foot lift with a flight of 12 locks yields the following: the plane took 5 minutes 30 seconds, and consumed 3,180 cubic feet of water <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> loaded boat. Locks (at 95 x 11 x 6 feet, means 6,270 cubic feet of water per lock) consume 72,240 cubic feet for 12 locks (about 23 times more water) and would take 96 minutes.|$|E

The 500-metre-long family <b>lift,</b> <b>a</b> modern T-bar <b>lift</b> with <b>a</b> difference in altitude of 120 metres, was completely rebuilt {{in the early}} 2000s. In addition, there is <b>a</b> 100-metre beginners <b>lift</b> with <b>a</b> difference in altitude of 20 metres. Right next to the beginners <b>lift,</b> <b>a</b> short run is usually prepared for sledges and toboggans. The [...] "Cafe Widdumstüble" [...] provides food as well as hot and cold drinks.

25|$|A knot {{in three}} {{dimensions}} can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, {{so there is no}} obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then slide it forward, and drop it back, now in front. Analogies for the plane would be <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.|$|E

25|$|In spring, {{the plant}} {{produces}} large, yellow flowers with 5-fold symmetry. The yellow petals {{are long and}} strap-like, and dangle over the umbrella-like style of the flower, which is held upside {{down at the end}} of a 50cm long scape. The stigma of the flower are found at the tips of the 'spokes' of this umbrella. Pollinating insects generally enter the flower from above, forcing their way into the cavity between the petals and umbrella, and depositing any pollen they are carrying on the stigmata as they enter. The pollinators generally exit the flower, having been dusted with the plant's own pollen, by <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> petal. This one-way system helps to ensure cross pollination.|$|E
25|$|The {{widening}} use of Ukrainian further {{developed in}} the first years of Bolshevik rule into a policy called korenizatsiya. The government pursued a policy of Ukrainianization by <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> ban on the Ukrainian language. That led to the introduction of an impressive education program which allowed Ukrainian-taught classes and raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone population. This policy was led by Education Commissar Mykola Skrypnyk and was directed to approximate the language to Russian. Newly generated academic efforts from the period of independence were co-opted by the Bolshevik government. The party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking but were encouraged to learn the Ukrainian language. Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized– in both population and in education.|$|E
