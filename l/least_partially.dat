5|$|In August 1513, James IV of Scotland invaded England {{with a large}} army; {{equipped}} with modern artillery, he took the border castles of Norham and Wark, and then moved south against Etal Castle. Etal surrendered quickly {{in the hope of}} avoiding being pillaged by James' army, but nonetheless it was at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> slighted - deliberately damaged to prevent it being used as a defence.|$|E

5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> {{motivated by}} the prospect of military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E
5|$|Spring Creek Dam {{was begun}} in 1961, {{when a company}} named Gibbons and Reed was awarded the contract. The {{clearing}} operations began in July of that same year, and the dam was officially dedicated by the Bureau of Reclamation on September 12, 1961. Construction of the dam began on October 20, 1961, with the placing of the dam embankment, which at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> consists of acidic sediment dredged from Spring Creek.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twenty}} A-4Gs were lost during the type's service with the RAN. This gave the Skyhawk a poor safety record, {{but the high}} loss rate was at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> {{attributable}} to the intrinsic dangers involved in operating from an aircraft carrier. Two pilots were killed in these accidents.|$|E
50|$|Because OpenOLAT {{is still}} a young LMS, there is not yet any {{independent}} literature. However, basic principles are shared with OLAT and therefore its literature can still be relevant to OpenOLAT. Since OpenOLAT was forked from OLAT 7.1, literature from before the fork is at <b>least</b> still <b>partially</b> valid for OpenOLAT.|$|R
50|$|Sunstein and Thaler {{apply the}} idea of nudges {{in the context of}} choice {{architecture}} to propose policy recommendations in the spirit of libertarian paternalism.

50|$|Interpersonal {{communication}} motives {{explain why}} people with communication apprehension communicate {{the way they}} do. People with low communication apprehension communicate for pleasure, affection, control, and relaxation while people with high communication apprehension communicate for inclusion and escape. Paulsel and Mottet (2004) found that interpersonal communication motives such as these are at <b>least</b> a <b>partially</b> influenced by genetically inherited traits.|$|R
5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon should be at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Madagascar, a {{total of}} 68casualties were {{reported}} and 100,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled to more than $250million (1984USD). Kamisy was considered the worst system to strike Madagascar since 1911. According to Relief Web, 7,000buildings were at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> destroyed, including 1,020 schools and 450 hospitals. Approximately 215 people were injured due to the storm. Overall, Kamisy was the strongest storm to hit the nation between 1980 and 1993.|$|E
5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E
5000|$|Hall {{suggests}} that Alcmaeon in Corinth {{may have used}} at <b>least</b> a <b>partially</b> comic tone. [...] This theory {{is based on a}} fragmentary dialogue exchange. One character, possibly Alcmaeon, says that he [...] "killed his mother, to put it in a nutshell." [...] Another character responds [...] "Was this a consensual act, or were you both reluctant?" ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the weak and}} the strong notions of partially honest agents (Dutta and Sen, 2012), and then study implementation by natural price-quantity mechanisms (Saijo et al., 1996, 1999) in pure exchange economies with three or more agents in which pure-consequentialistically rational agents and partially honest agents coexist. Firstly, assuming that there exists at <b>least</b> one <b>partially</b> honest agent in either the weak notion or the strong notion, the class of efficient social choice correspondences which are Nash-implementable by such mechanisms is characterized. Secondly, the (unconstrained) Walrasian correspondence is shown to be implementable by such a mechanism when there is at <b>least</b> one <b>partially</b> honest agent of the strong type, which may provide a behavioral foundation for decentralized implementation of the Walrasian equilibrium. Finally, in this set-up, the effects of honesty on the implementation of more equitable Pareto optimal allocations {{can be viewed as}} negligible. ...|$|R
50|$|Follicular {{lymphoma}} {{is a type}} {{of blood}} cancer. It is the most common of the indolent (slow-growing) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas overall. It is defined as a lymphoma of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at <b>least</b> a <b>partially</b> follicular pattern. It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD22, and usually CD20, but almost always negative for CD5.|$|R
5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, Veridian Dynamics, experiments on its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that Veridian has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, {{and that there are}} only three governments left in the world which are more powerful than Veridian. Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> in the science fiction genre.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at <b>least)</b> <b>partially</b> unknown.|$|E
50|$|The caldera is {{composed}} of overlapping shield volcanoes, cut by at <b>least</b> four <b>partially</b> overlapping calderas, of which the oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years before the present era (BP). The subsequent Skaros caldera was created about 70,000 years BP, and the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years BP. The current caldera was formed about 3600 years BP during the Minoan eruption.|$|R
5000|$|It {{appears that}} the text may be a {{caricature}} of an actual pidgin, or at <b>least</b> of <b>partially</b> acquired Arabic. It shares several features with Juba Arabic and Nubi Creole: a complete lack of inflection, including articles, possessive markers, and agreement; a single negative marker; ʔmny for the third-person dual pronoun, and perhaps the use of jaʿal 'make' rather than colloquial qaʿad 'stay' for the progressive.|$|R
50|$|Bon {{and later}} European authors treated all species that were {{aromatic}} and had at <b>least</b> a <b>partially</b> epithelial pileipellis as section Olentes, whereas Hesler and Smith and later North American authors treat all species {{with such a}} pileipellis (both aromatic and non-aromatic) as the section Thojogali. However, a thorough molecular phylogenetic investigation of Lactarius {{has yet to be}} published, and older classification systems of Lactarius are generally not regarded as natural.|$|R
5|$|Mickl {{was born}} Johann Mikl in Zelting, Radkersburg, which {{was part of}} the Duchy of Styria within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father Mathias was a German farmer from Terbegofzen, and his mother Maria (née Dervarič), was from Zelting, and of at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> Slovene heritage. Mikl had a twin brother, Alois, who was killed in action in 1915 in Galicia near Lemberg, present-day Lviv in the Ukraine. As a child, Mikl spoke German, Slovene and Hungarian, and {{remained}} fluent in all three throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana. Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad in town, caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{occupied}} by {{a unit of the}} Royal Armoured Corps, who served as observers; the soldiers appear to have relied on the stone walls for protection rather than trenches, and, unusually, no additional firing points were cut out of the stonework, as typically happened elsewhere. The surrounding beaches were defended with lines of barbed wire, slit trenches and square weapons pits, reinforced by concrete pillboxes to the north and south of the castle, at <b>least</b> <b>partially</b> laid down by the 1st Battalion Essex Regiment.|$|E
25|$|In Twin Sudoku two regular grids share a 3×3 box. This {{is one of}} many {{possible}} types of overlapping grids. The rules for each individual grid are the same as in normal Sudoku, but the digits in the overlapping section are shared by each half. In some compositions neither individual grid can be solved alone - the complete solution is only possible after each individual grid has at <b>least</b> been <b>partially</b> solved.|$|R
