It also examines {{the question of whether}} DNA is methylated in the chloroplast genome of flax. Finally, the thesis looks at the differences in transcript abundance of the flowering genes LEAFY and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 in RC and RE 2. Methylation levels in RE 1 and RE 2 were found to be lower than in RC from 24 days of age to the onset of flowering and the levels of all three lines increase with tissue age and/or differentiation. In addition, buds of RE 2 were hypomethylated relative to RC. If plants were placed in the dark prior to DNA extraction, hypomethylation was not seen in the total DNA of RE 2. The chloroplast DNA of flax was found to be methylated, and RE 2 chloroplast DNA was hypomethylated relative to RC. Differences in transcript levels of LFY were seen in RC and RE 2 shoot tips, where a higher accumulation of transcript seen in RE 2 compared to RC may be related to its earlier flowering time. In leaves, {{there was no significant difference}} in the transcript abundance of LFY between RC and RE 2. TFL 1 was detected in genomic DNA of RC and RE 2; it was not detected in the cDNA of the two lines. In summary, compared to RC, hypomethylation was seen in the total DNA of RE 2 plants grown under regular light conditions and the methylation levels in the all lines increased with age in shoot tips, cotyledons, and leaves. The chloroplast DNA of RE 2 was also hypomethylated relative to that of RC. RE 2 accumulated LFY transcript in shoot tips at flowering, which was not the case in RC.

40|$|Genetic {{studies were}} carried out under {{controlled}} phytotron conditions, on McGregor (a Canadian flax cultivar) and four EMS-induced fatty acid mutant lines of McGregor. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the inheritance of the mutated genes in the mutants (which, prior to this study, were described as: E 67 - ­high in palmitic acid; E 1747 -low in linolenic acid; E 1929 -elevated oleic acid; and E 1536 -high in both oleic and linoleic acids). Crosses among these five <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> were made in all possible combinations. Fatty acid analysis of the seed oil from F 1, F 2 and backcross populations indicated the control of the characteristic fatty acids in the mutant lines to be under simple Mendelian inheritance. The high palmitic acid character in E 67 and the moderately low linolenic-high oleic acid character of E 1929 were each controlled by a single partially dominant gene, whereas the very low linolenic-high linoleic character of E 1747 was controlled by two partially dominant genes at independent loci. The E 1929 gene apparently is allelic to one of the two genes in E 1747. A partial maternal effect was observed for the control of the palmitic acid trait in E 67. E 1536 is a true mutant. However, its mutated character could not be detected, due to its "chameleon-like" behaviour. A moderately low linolenic-elevated oleic and linoleic acid phenotype was vaguely inferred. The flax mutants showed varying degrees of interaction when they were crossed with each other; this interaction(s) being inversely proportional to the closeness of the characteristic fatty acid phenotypes of the mutants (involved in a cross), in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Since the inheritance of these mutant characters are controlled by one or two genes, breeding for these characteristics should be relatively simple. Two ¹⁴C radio-labelled investigations were conducted to determine enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway that may have been affected to produce these mutant phenotypes: i) ¹⁴C acetate (in vivo) assays and ii) in vitro target enzyme assays using ¹⁴C-labelled precursors. Gas chromatography was used for the analysis of fatty acid composition, whereas a scintillation counter and high performance liquid chromatography were used for assaying radioactive fatty acids. ¹H-NMR analyses were also conducted on intact seeds to determine oil contents of the <b>flax</b> <b>lines.</b> The ¹⁴C-sodium acetate experiments could not help in the identification of the fatty acid synthesis enzymes which were affected in producing these mutant lines. Based on the in vitro enzyme assays, none of the following,enzymes appeared to be responsible for the high palmitic acid character in E 67 : 16 : 0 -ACP thioesterase, 18 : 1 -­ACP thioesterase and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase II. ¹H-NMR data on oil content showed that whereas the mutations in E 67 and E 1929 had no effect on oil content (relative to McGregor), the mutation in E 1536 resulted in a drastic 47 % reduction in oil content. A relative 30 % increment in oil content was shown by E 1747.

Here, we characterized a 2, 588 bp transcript differentially expressed in male sterile <b>lines</b> of <b>flax.</b> The twelve intron gene predicted to encode a 368 amino acid protein has five WD 40 repeats which, in silico, form a propeller structure with putative nucleic acid and histone binding capabilities.

Five types of transgenic flax that were generated to improve fiber quality and resistance to pathogens, through increased levels of either phenylpropanoids (W 92. 40), gly-cosyltransferase (GT 4, GT 5), or PR 2 beta- 1, 3 -glucanase (B 14) or produce polyhydroxybutyrate (M 50), were used. Introduced genetic modifications did not change the degree of mycorrhizal colonization as compared to parent cultivars Linola and Nike. Arbuscules were well developed in each tested transgenic type (except M 50). In two lines (W 92. 40 and B 14), a higher abundance of arbuscules was observed when compared to control, untransformed flax plants. How-ever, in some cases (W 92. 40, GT 4, GT 5, and B 14 Md), the mycorrhizal dependency for biomass production of trans-genic plants was slightly lower when compared to the orig-inal cultivars. No significant influence of mycorrhiza on the photosynthetic activity of transformed lines was found, but in most cases P concentration in mycorrhizal plants remained higher than in nonmycorrhizal ones.

Statistical methods and data adjustment for soil heterogeneity have been previously described for this design. In the absence of replicated test genotypes in MAD 2, their total variance cannot be partitioned into genetic and error components as required to estimate heritability and genetic correlation of quantitative traits, the two conventional genetic parameters used for breeding selection. We propose a method of estimating the error variance of unreplicated genotypes that uses replicated controls, and then of estimating the genetic parameters. Using the Delta method, we also derived formulas for estimating the sampling variances of the genetic parameters. Computer simulations indicated that the proposed method for estimating genetic parameters and their sampling variances was feasible and {{the reliability of the}} estimates was positively associated with the level of heritability of the trait.

40|$|Flax {{is often}} {{considered}} a total utilization crop {{because of the}} potential to extract value from two distinct products - seeds and stem fibres. However, very little genetic information is available on flax fibre genetics in comparison to oil improvement studies. In order to gain a detailed understanding of genetic control of the fibre concentration and search for the possibilities of developing dual purpose <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> using both seed oil and stem fibre, the following studies were initiated: The first study evaluated the fibre and oil-related traits in a recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between a fibre flax variety Viking and an oilseed flax genotype E 1747 over multiple locations under western Canadian field conditions. The study confirmed the presence of a significant genotype by environment interaction (p < 0. 01) for fibre concentration indicating selection for this trait will be challenging. However, a lack of significant correlation between fibre and oilseed characteristics in field trials was encouraging and strengthened the hypothesis that breeding dual purpose flax types for western Canada is possible. The study also identified potential recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with enhanced fibre concentration as well as oil characteristics for use in future breeding endeavors. The second study established an anatomical basis for further research into flax fibre improvement by studying differences between the stem anatomy of 14 diverse flax genotypes in the field and under controlled environments such as a growth chamber. The results from the study supported the use of controlled environments for the purpose of quick screening of high fibre containing genotypes, especially at the green capsule stage of plant growth. The results also indicated {{that it was possible to}} select high fibre oilseed <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> based on anatomical markers such as average area of single fibre cells, total fibre area and fibre to stem area ratio. In the third study, 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 2 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) molecular markers were used to assess the extent of genetic variability in the Viking × E 1747 RIL population. CAPS markers LuFAD 3 A and LuFAD 3 B had the highest marker trait association (p < 0. 0001) with linoleic and linolenic acid concentration. SSR markers such as CV 8824, 5 B 6 and LU 32 were found to be associated with plant height, oil concentration and protein concentration respectively using single marker analysis and step wise regression analysis. The molecular study confirmed the importance of Viking × E 1747 mapping population in identifying genes/ markers related to both fibre and oilseed related traits in flax. In the fourth study, global transcript profiling using cDNA - based microarrays was performed to identify differentially expressed fibre related transcripts between Viking and E 1747. The largest group of transcripts (7 %) found more abundant in Viking relative to E 1747 fell under the functional group of cell wall development using gene ontology (GO) analysis. Transcripts such as callose synthases, expansins, cytochrome P 450, fasciclin-like arabino galactan proteins and β-galactosidases were highly abundant in Viking relative to E 1747. The transcripts more abundant in E 1747 relative to Viking were UDP – glucose glucosyltransferase, auxin repressed protein, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, peroxidases and lipid transfer proteins. Quantitative real time PCR results confirmed the suitability of the microarray platform to accurately discriminate transcript profiles between the two diverse flax types. In conclusion, this research has provided a number of new insights into flax fibre genetics. This information lays the foundation for further genetic studies on flax bast fibres and will complement research on developing dual purpose flax varieties...|$|R

Then next observe the three virtues definitely set forth by the three families of plants--not arbitrarily or fancifully associated with them, but in all the three cases marked for us by Scriptural words: 1st.

The P 2 resistance gene was identified by transposon tagging and transgenic expression. P 2 {{is a member of}} a small multigene family and encodes a protein with nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an N-terminal Toll/interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) homology domain, as well as a C-terminal non-LRR (CNL) domain of ∼ 150 amino acids. A related CNL domain was detected in almost half of the predicted Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR sequences, including the RPS 4 and RPP 1 resistance proteins, and in the tobacco N protein, but not in the flax L and M proteins. Presence or absence of this domain defines two subclasses of TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes. Truncations of the P 2 CNL domain cause loss of function, and evidence for diversifying selection was detected in this domain, suggesting a possible role in specificity determination. A spontaneous rust-susceptible mutant of P 2 contained a G→E amino acid substitution in the GLPL motif, which is conserved in the NBS domains of plant resistance proteins and the animal cell death control proteins APAF- 1 and CED 4, providing direct evidence for the importance of this motif in resistance gene function.

The nature of the genomic changes suggests a very different mechanism, which is not yet understood, from that of other DNA changes {{in response to}} stress, such as the activation of transposable elements. To identify the genes that control genomic changes in response to stress in flax, reciprocal crosses were made between a responsive <b>flax</b> <b>line,</b> Stormont cirrus, and an unresponsive line, Bethune. The ability of the F 2 generation (from selfed F 1 plants) to respond to nutrient stress was assayed using the insertion of LIS- 1 as the criteria for responsiveness. Twenty-nine out of 89 F 2 s responded at 5 weeks, suggesting that 3 - 4 dominant loci were all necessary for early LIS- 1 insertion. Seventy out of 76 responded at 10 weeks, indicating two dominant loci independently capable of initiating LIS- 1 insertion under prolonged nutrient stress. F 1 plants and their progeny with either P 1 or Bethune as the maternal parent were capable of responding with LIS- 1 insertion, indicating that LIS- 1 insertion is under nuclear genetic control and does not involve maternal factors. Thus, a small number of loci within the genome of Stormont cirrus appear to control the ability to respond to nutrient stress with LIS- 1 insertion. A genetic map of the flax genome is currently under construction, and will be used to identify these loci within the genome.

In general, delayed seeding was accompanied by reduction of emergence, number of days to maturity, yield and yield components in all genotypes, with the exception that the last seeding date led to increased number of days to maturity and seeds per capsule.

The origin of LIS- 1 in the flax genome is uncertain. One possibility is that since LIS- 1 does not exist intact in the progenitor line, it is assembled from small sequences found scattered throughout the genome, and that, under stressful growth conditions, induction occurs and these sequences are rearranged and assembled to form the intact LIS- 1 element. It is unknown whether the intact LIS- 1 element would remain stably integrated in other plant species or {{if it would be}} destabilized from their genome. Results: In this study, Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation via floral dipping was used to transform different accessions of the Columbia ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana, with either LIS- 1 or the target site into which LIS- 1 integrates. The stability and the inheritance patterns of both elements were followed in subsequent generations. Our results indicate that, in the different transformed accessions, the target site of LIS- 1 remains stable in the T 1 and T 2 generations. However, LIS- 1 is not found intact in any transformed A. thaliana plants. Instead, it goes through multiple fragmentation events, which seem to be genotype dependent. In the process, the region originally flanking LIS- 1 in the T-DNA construct can be converted to the same sequence found at the target site in flax, followed by complete excision of all the flax DNA in the construct. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the processes by which LIS- 1 is produced in flax are also present in A. thaliana because both plants are capable of destabilizing the intact LIS- 1 element.

40|$|Flax wilt {{is caused}} by the soil-borne fungal {{pathogen}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Fol). The best control method is to develop resistant cultivars to be grown in the field. The objectives of this study were to develop a controlled environment phenotyping method to test <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> for reaction to flax wilt and screen a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for reaction to flax wilt under a controlled environment and compare the observations with field evaluations at wilt nurseries. Finally, the inheritance of flax wilt resistance of the RIL population was assessed using phenotypic data from the controlled environment and field test. Four flax cultivars: Bison and Aurore (wilt resistant) and Novelty and Oliver (wilt susceptible), were inoculated with 17 Fol isolates under controlled conditions. Plants were assessed on the degree of yellowing, browning and wilting. Disease severity (DS) at 21 and 28 days after inoculation (dai) and the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were used to group the isolates. Isolates 65, 81 and 131 were the moderately aggressive and selected to phenotype a RIL population developed by crossing Aurore and Oliver (AO). For all isolates gradual increase in DS and AUDPC among RILs was observed. Similar observations were made in each wilt nursery. Moderate correlations were observed between controlled conditions and wilt field nursery experiments, signifying the importance of controlled condition experimental data as predictors of flax wilt resistance in the field. Inheritance of flax wilt resistance was observed to segregate in a 3 : 1 ratio, of susceptible to resistant. Thus, this suggested that two independent, recessive genes conferred wilt resistance to the AO RIL population. However, the phenotypic observations indicated the additive effect of minor genes. This study indicated the significance of identifying the inheritance pattern of wilt resistance in flax populations and highlights the need to locate resistance genes within the genome. This would assist in marker assisted selections (MAS) in flax breeding to reduce time and labour, and also to incorporate wilt resistant genes to develop flax cultivars resilient to Fol pathotypes...|$|R
40|$|Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an {{important}} plant valuable for industry. Some <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> can undergo heritable phenotypic and genotypic changes (LIS- 1 insertion being the most common) in response to nutrient stress and are called plastic lines. Offspring of plastic lines, which stably inherit the changes, are called genotrophs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are involved in a}} crucial regulatory mechanism of gene expression. They have previously been assumed to take part in nutrient stress response and can, therefore, participate in genotroph formation. In the present study, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs extracted from flax plants grown under normal, phosphate deficient and nutrient excess conditions to identify miRNAs and evaluate their expression. Our analysis revealed expression of 96 conserved miRNAs from 21 families in flax. Moreover, 475 novel potential miRNAs were identified for the first time, and their targets were predicted. However, none of the identified miRNAs were transcribed from LIS- 1. Expression of 7 miRNAs (miR 168, miR 169, miR 395, miR 398, miR 399, miR 408, and lus-miR-N 1) with up- or down-regulation under nutrient stress (on the basis of high-throughput sequencing data) was evaluated on extended sampling using qPCR. Reference gene search identified ETIF 3 H and ETIF 3 E genes as most suitable for this purpose. Down-regulation of novel potential lus-miR-N 1 and up-regulation of conserved miR 399 were revealed under the phosphate deficient conditions. In addition, the negative correlation of expression of lus-miR-N 1 and its predicted target, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 gene, as well as, miR 399 and its predicted target, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E 2 gene, was observed. Thus, in our study, miRNAs expressed in <b>flax</b> plastic <b>lines</b> and genotrophs were identified and their expression and expression of their targets was evaluated using high-throughput sequencing and qPCR for the first time. These data provide new insights into nutrient stress response regulation in plastic flax cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) {{is widely}} used for {{production}} of textile, food, chemical and pharmaceutical products. However, various stresses decrease flax production. Search for genes, which are involved in stress response, is necessary for breeding of adaptive cultivars. Imbalanced concentration of nutrient elements in soil decrease flax yields and also results in heritable changes in some <b>flax</b> <b>lines.</b> The appearance of Linum Insertion Sequence 1 (LIS- 1) is the most studied modification. However, LIS- 1 function is still unclear. Results High-throughput sequencing of transcriptome of flax plants grown under normal (N), phosphate deficient (P), and nutrient excess (NPK) conditions was carried out using Illumina platform. The assembly of transcriptome was performed, {{and a total of}} 34924, 33797, and 33698 unique transcripts for N, P, and NPK sequencing libraries were identified, respectively. We have not revealed any LIS- 1 derived mRNA in our sequencing data. The analysis of high-throughput sequencing data allowed us to identify genes with potentially differential expression under imbalanced nutrition. For further investigation with qPCR, 15 genes were chosen and their expression levels were evaluated in the extended sampling of 31 flax plants. Significant expression alterations were revealed for genes encoding WRKY and JAZ protein families under P and NPK conditions. Moreover, the alterations of WRKY family genes differed depending on LIS- 1 presence in flax plant genome. Besides, we revealed slight and LIS- 1 independent mRNA level changes of KRP 2 and ING 1 genes, which are adjacent to LIS- 1, under nutrition stress. Conclusions Differentially expressed genes were identified in flax plants, which were grown under phosphate deficiency and excess nutrition, on the basis of high-throughput sequencing and qPCR data. We showed that WRKY and JAS gene families participate in flax response to imbalanced nutrient content in soil. Besides, we have not identified any mRNA, which could be derived from LIS- 1, in our transcriptome sequencing data. Expression of LIS- 1 flanking genes, ING 1 and KRP 2, was suggested not to be nutrient stress-induced. Obtained results provide new insights into edaphic stress response in flax and the role of LIS- 1 in these process...|$|R
40|$|Several early-flowering flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) {{lines were}} derived from {{treatment}} of germinating seeds with 5 -azacytidine in 1990. These lines are also shorter, have fewer leaves, and their DNA is hypomethylated, relative to their corresponding controls. The work presented in this thesis used early-flowering and control lines of the Royal (R) flax genotype, and the Large (L) flax genotroph. Firstly, levels of cytosine methylation were measured over a 24 -hour period in the early-flowering line RE 2 and its control (RC), using an HPLC method. Secondly, to determine {{the response of the}} <b>flax</b> <b>lines</b> to short-day conditions, control and early-flowering lines from both L and R were grown in either 8 -hour-day or ambient, longday light conditions, and were compared in a number of aspects of development. Thirdly, primers for five putative flax flowering genes (SOC 1, COL, ADG 1, GAI, and AP 1) were designed and a semi-quantitative PCR method was used to establish developmental expression profiles in leaves and shoot tips of RC and RE 2 in order to detect differences in expression that may have resulted from the original demethylation treatment. Methylation was found to remain constant in RC and RE 2 over the 24 -hour period in all three tissues examined. In the short-day experiment the early-flowering lines differed from controls in a number of parameters, but the most notable were that the treatment delayed flowering and increased the number of leaves produced in all lines, but had less of an effect on the early-flowering lines. Expression patterns for the five genes examined indicated that they are all expressed in both leaves and shoot tips, and for most genes there was no indication that their expression had been altered by the demethylation treatment. However, AP 1 expression was higher in leaves of RE 2 than those of RC, and was found to reach higher levels in the buds of RE 2 than those of RC. These expression differences {{may be the result of}} demethylation of a gene upstream of API that was affected by the demethylation treatment. The results of these experiments further demonstrate the differences between the early-flowering lines and their controls, and will help elucidate the genetic basis for these differences...|$|R
40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is {{the second}} most {{important}} oilseed crop in western Canada. Seed colour is used in Canada to distinguish the two main market types from each other. Regular, high linolenic acid flax must have brown seed while "zero" linolenic acid solin flax must be yellow-seeded. The most frequent seed colours in flax are brown and yellow and are determined by genes at three loci (G, B 1 and D). Yellow seed colour results when homozygous recessive alleles are present at any of the loci. A dominant allele for yellow seed colour as well as a recessive allele for variegated seed have been recently identified but their interaction to the other genes was unknown. Hence, the main objective of this research was to determine the allelic relationships among the various genes conditioning seed colour in <b>flax.</b> Eleven <b>flax</b> <b>lines,</b> five with a recessive yellow seed phenotype [(YSED 2, YSED 4, S 95407 and S 96071 (CDC recessive yellow) ] and G- 1186 / 94 (European recessive yellow), two dominant yellow seed (YSED 18 and CPI 84495), three brown seed (ED 47, Vimy and CDC Bethune) and one variegated seed (M 96006), were crossed in all possible combinations, excluding reciprocal crossings. Following these crosses, test crosses were performed using five USDA introductions {{in order to determine the}} seed colour alleles possessed by each parental line. The five USDA introductions (Minerva, Bolley Golden, Viking, Crystal and Bionda) had defined alleles for yellow seed colour. Chi-squared tests of goodness-­of-fit to various one and two gene segregation ratios indicated that yellow seed colour in the CDC recessive yellow parents (YSED 2, YSED 4, S 95407 and S 96071) was conditioned by the recessive allele of the g locus. Yellow seed in the European recessive yellow was controlled by a recessive allele of a different locus, d. A dominant allele of the Y 1 locus, governed yellow seed colour in the dominant yellow parents (YSED 18 and CPI 84495). The variegated seed colour in the variegated parent (M 96006) was conditioned by a newly described allele of the b 1 locus, b 1 vg. All loci segregated independently and the recessive genes, b 1 vg, g and d when homozygous recessive were epistatic to the other loci. Seed colour was known to affect seed oil concentration and oil concentration of homozygous brown, yellow or variegated lines was determined. Yellow or variegated seed lines had greater oil concentration than brown seed. Yellow seed conditioned by the d allele had the most significant effect on high oil concentration while b 1 vg...|$|R
