To apply our approach in practice, we introduce a simpler sound transformation which only satisfies the 'only if '-pa. rt.

The importance of correctly selecting part flow and job routing protocols in flexible manufacturing systems to reduce complexity is thereby conclusively demonstrated. 1 Introduction In a general flexible manufacturing system (FMS) where resources are shared, a key role in part routing, job selection, and resource assignment is played by the FMS controller. Given the same resources of machines, robots, fixtures, tooling, and so on, different structures result under different routing/assignment strategies by the controller. Unstructured strategies are generally clasified as the so-called job shop organization, while structured protocols [...] ...|$|E

Let Pn be the path with n vertices, and Cn be {{the cost of an}} optimal, line broadcast scheme from a terminal vertex in path Pn. We show that a minimum-cost line broadcast scheme from any source vertex in Pn has cost no more than Cn and no less than Cn − n + 2 for any n ⩾ 2 and any time t > [log 2 n]. We derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cost of a minimum-time line broadcast from a terminal vertex in certain paths and relate this to costs from nearby sources...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to analyze the performance and the added value of automatic recommender systems in an industrial context. We show that recommender systems are multifaceted and can be organized around 4 structuring functions: help users to decide, help users to compare, help users to discover, help users to explore. A global off <b>line</b> <b>protocol</b> is then proposed to evaluate recommender systems. This protocol {{is based on the}} definition of appropriate evaluation measures for each aforementioned function. The evaluation protocol is discussed {{from the perspective of the}} usefulness and trust of the recommendation. A new measure called Average Measure of Impact is introduced. This measure evaluates the impact of the personalized recommendation. We experiment with two classical methods, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF), using the well known dataset: Netflix. A segmentation of both users and items is proposed to finely analyze where the algorithms perform well or badly. We show that the performance is strongly dependent on the segments and that there is no clear correlation between the RMSE and the quality of the recommendation.

40|$|Two {{departments}} at Utah State University have collaborated {{to operate}} an observatory near Bear Lake, Utah. The {{purpose of the}} observatory is to study various phenomena in the upper atmosphere, and houses such instruments as high-power CCD cameras, a radar system, and others. Until recently, only one instrument has had the capability of being controlled and monitored remotely. Since the other instruments do not have this capability, they must be set up and left running, only to have a person drive up to the observatory to check their operation after a given amount of time. This monitoring system is not only costly in terms of research time, but has been the cause of data loss in the past. The system reviewed in this paper was {{designed to provide a}} low cost, short-term {{solution to the problem of}} remote access. A computer system located on the USU campus communicates to a gateway computer at the observatory, which, in turn, is connected to the various observatory instruments.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The testes {{have been}} {{considered}} a sanctuary site for leukemic cells and testicular relapses used to account for a major proportion of the poor outcome of boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With use of aggressive chemotherapy which includes intermediate or high dose methotrexate, the incidence of testicular relapses has declined. However once these patients have received cranial irradiation {{as a part of}} the front <b>line</b> <b>protocol,</b> high dose methotrexate needs to be avoided because of risk of developing leucoencephalopathy. AIM: To study the use of non cross resistant chemotherapeutic agents along with a regimen containing lower doses of methotrexate in patients of isolated testicular relapse (ITR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients with ITR treated with modified version of the CCG- 112 protocol which consists of intensive systemic chemotherapy, cranial chemoprophylaxis along with testicular irradiation. RESULTS: One patient died of regimen related toxicity. Two patients relapsed in the bone marrow during maintenance. Of the nine patients who completed treatment, eight are alive and in remission. One patient had a bone marrow relapse two months after completing treatment. The Kaplan Meier estimates give us an Event Free Survival (EFS) of 66. 7 &#x 0025; at 10 yrs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, though the incidence is very low, patients with ITR should be treated aggressively since they have an excellent chance of achieving a long term EFS...|$|E

Due to the dynamic nature of ad hoc networking it is necessary for an organization that communication performance major should be there for reliability and network management so that performance major for finding routs (path) based on least cost routing using hop count performance will be major.

Methods Fifteen young healthy adults (mean age 22 ± 3 years, 8 females and 7 males) with healthy corneae and no contraindications to contact lens wear were fitted with a highly oxygen permeable 16. 5 mm diameter miniscleral contact lens (Dk 100, minimum centre thickness 300 µm). A high resolution optical coherence tomographer with anterior segment module was used to capture serial central corneal thickness measurements during scleral lens wear (with the lens on eye) at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 480 minutes after lens insertion.
