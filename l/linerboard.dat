25|$|While the Moores {{government}} {{was successful in}} implementing democratic reforms, his government had little impact on improving Newfoundland's economy. Much {{of his time in}} power was monopolized with completing unfinished industrial projects negotiated by Smallwood, many of which were unsuccessful. The government tried to re-negotiate the sale of Upper Churchill Hydro electricity to Hydro-Quebec, but was unsuccessful. In 1974, $160 million was paid the British Newfoundland Corporation (BRINCO) to buy back water rights and obtain a controlling interest in the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited, with hopes of developing hydro power on the Lower Churchill river. However, the {{government was}} not able to negotiate a transmission route across Quebec to sell power into the North American market. The Stephenville <b>linerboard</b> mill was another drain on government money and resources. By the time Moores took office in 1972, the mill's projected cost had increased from $75 million to $122 million, and government guarantees had more than doubled from $53 million to $110 million. The mill was losing $100 on every ton of <b>linerboard</b> it produced by 1976, and needed government subsidies to stay afloat. The province closed the mill, owned by the Crown corporation Labrador <b>Linerboard</b> Limited, in August 1977 and sold the mill to Abitibi-Price Ltd. for $43.5 million. The Come By Chance Refinery also cost the government millions of dollars in loans, including $60 million in 1975. The refinery was $42 million in debt to the province when it filed for bankruptcy in 1976.|$|E

50|$|Commonly {{known as}} the Yellow Sheet, the {{magazine}} {{was used as a}} standard for both transacted containerboard pricing (<b>linerboard</b> and medium) and multiple grades of recovered paper stock pricing. It was also used to track <b>linerboard</b> prices as an economic indicator. The magazine was part of Magazines for Industry Inc. In 2009 Mark Arzoumanian was the editor-in-chief of the magazine. The headquarters was in Chicago.|$|E
30|$|The <b>linerboards</b> was cremated. We {{have created}} a {{recycling}} die (50  kg per month). This sector was subsequently extended to the entire hospital structure, particularly the pharmacy that produces 12 containers of 400  L per month. They are now sold without additional cost.|$|R
5000|$|Corrugated {{fiberboard}} is {{a material}} {{consisting of a}} fluted corrugated sheet {{and one or two}} flat <b>linerboards.</b> It is made on [...] "flute lamination machines" [...] or [...] "corrugators" [...] and is used in the manufacture of shipping containers and corrugated boxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{corrugated}} medium, flute size, combining adhesive, and <b>linerboards</b> can be varied to engineer a corrugated board with specific properties to match {{a wide variety}} of potential uses. Double and triple-wall corrugated board is also produced for high stacking strength and puncture resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{corrugated}} medium, flute size, combining adhesive, and <b>linerboards</b> can be varied {{to design a}} corrugated board with specific properties. In this paper, the nonlinear finite element analysis of the fluted corrugated sheet in the corrugated cardboard based on software SolidWorks 2008 was investigated. The model of corrugated board with three or more flutes is reliable for stress and displacement measurement to eliminate {{the influence of the}} number of flutes in models. According to the static pressure test, with the increase of flute height H or arc radius of flute, the maximum stress in the models decreased and the maximum displacement increased. However the maximum stress and maximum displacement in the models increase nonlinearly in the static pressure test with the increase of the flute angle θ. According to the drop test, with the increase of flute height H, the maximum stress of goods on the upper board in the drop test decreased. The maximum stress of the model in the drop test decreases firstly and then increases with the increase of flute angle, and the optimal flute angle θ could be 60 ° for corrugated board. All the conclusions are consistent with experimental data or product standards...|$|R
50|$|The factory {{survived and}} was {{dominating}} in its field north of Dovrefjell, until the 1960s {{when it got}} a sizeable competitor in Nordenfjelske Treforedling. Ranheim Papirfabrikk {{became a part of}} Norske Skogindustrier in 1971. In 1983 the company was sold to the conglomerate M. Peterson & Søn, founded in 1801 in Moss. Following a later reorganization the production unit at Ranheim has been split in two; Peterson <b>Linerboard</b> AS, Ranheim and Peterson Emballasje AS, Ranheim, parts the two main branches Peterson <b>Linerboard</b> and Peterson Packaging respectively. However the factory still exists.|$|E

50|$|Containerboard, (CCM or {{corrugated}} case material) {{is a type}} {{of paperboard}} specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board. It includes both <b>linerboard</b> and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up corrugated board. Since containerboard is made mainly out of natural unbleached wood fibers, it is generally brown, although its shade may vary {{depending on the type of}} wood, pulping process, recycling rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation, white bleached pulp or coating is used on the top ply of the <b>linerboard</b> that goes outside the box.|$|E
5000|$|The {{corrugated}} medium is often [...] basis {{weight in the}} U.S.; in the UK, a [...] fluting paper is common. At the single-facer, it is heated, moistened, and formed into a fluted pattern on geared wheels. This is joined to a flat <b>linerboard</b> with a starch based adhesive to form single face board. At the double-backer, a second flat <b>linerboard</b> is adhered {{to the other side}} of the fluted medium to form single wall corrugated board. Linerboards are test liners (recycled paper) or kraft paperboard (of various grades). The liner may be bleached white, mottled white, colored, or preprinted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of containerboard {{is the highest}} {{of all kinds of}} paper in the world. More than 100 million tons are produced annually. It is made in specialized paper machines out of virgin as well as recycled fibers. <b>Linerboard</b> made of virgin pulp is called kraftliner, whereas recycled <b>linerboard</b> is known as testliner. The corrugating medium may be recycled medium, called wellenstoff in Europe, or virgin, which is called semichemical medium for the type of pulp used in its production. The borders of these categories become a little blurred, however, when both virgin and recycled fibers are used in making one product.|$|E
5000|$|The Antioch mill in {{northern}} California (midway between San Francisco and Sacramento) had used 100% recycle pulp since 1977, {{and had a}} gas turbine co-generation facility, installed in 1982. The mill and adjacent converting complex was opened in 1956 by Crown Zellerbach to use pulp from British Columbia to make tissue, toweling, multiwall bags, and <b>linerboard</b> for the northern California market. The pulp was delivered by company ship to the Antioch mill's deep-water dock on the San Joaquin River. Eventually the consumer products were phased out and the mill downsized to a single Fourdrinier paper machine (260 in wide), which produced <b>linerboard</b> and corrugating medium for corrugated boxes. Recycled pulp from the adjacent Secondary Fiber mill was first produced in 1969, reclaimed from old corrugated containers (OCC) and initially used as an extender for virgin pulp. Within eight years the mill's fiber supply was 100% recycle for all its grades of <b>linerboard</b> and medium, and {{for nearly a decade}} the Antioch mill was home of the [...] "World's Largest Recycle Paper Machine." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{corrugated}} medium and <b>linerboard</b> board both {{are made of}} kraft containerboard, a paperboard material usually over 0.01 in thick. Corrugated fiberboard and paperboard are sometimes called corrugated cardboard, although cardboard might be any heavy paper-pulp based board.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of a plant {{designed}} to produce pulp to make brown sack paper or <b>linerboard</b> for boxes and packaging, the pulp does not always need to be bleached to a high brightness. Bleaching decreases the mass of pulp produced by about 5%, decreases the strength of the fibers and adds to the cost of manufacture.|$|E

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} popular in usage is a hybrid product featuring the structural benefits of corrugated {{combined with the}} high-graphics print of lithography previously restricted to paperboard folding cartons. This application, generally referred to as 'Single-Face Laminate', begins its process as a traditional fluted medium adhered to a single <b>linerboard</b> (single-face), but {{in place of a}} second long-fibered liner, a pre-printed sheet of paperboard such as SBS (solid bleached sulfate) is laminated to the outer facing. The sheet can then be converted with the same processes used for other corrugated manufacturing into any desired form.|$|E
50|$|Based on this state-of-the-art, the {{objective}} of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as <b>linerboard</b> and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of {{addition}} of precipitated lignin, from spent pulping black liquor, to a wet single-ply <b>linerboard</b> handsheet followed by hot-pressing at different temperatures, on the improvement of its compressive strength. <b>Linerboard</b> handsheets for testing {{the effect of}} lignin addition were prepared so that the lignin-modified sheets {{would have the same}} basis weights as the control handsheets. Both the commercial and the black liquor lignin were added as a powder to wet handsheets after couching from the handsheet mold. The experiments and testing of the physical and strength properties of dried handsheets were conducted according to TAPPI test methods. The results revealed that the addition of the recovered lignin (at pH of 2) to the wet handsheet followed by hot-pressing at 150 °C increased the compressive strength of <b>linerboard</b> handsheets by 10 % to 20 % above that for handsheets made without the addition of lignin. The same results were achieved using purchased lignin. However, with a 16 % addition to <b>linerboard,</b> purchased lignin would be too expensive. These results indicate that inclusion of kraft lignin in <b>linerboard</b> sheets could be proved as an attractive option to reduce <b>linerboard</b> basis weight...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} test {{was conducted to}} investigate the characteristics of <b>linerboard</b> and corrugated medium paper made from durian rind waste. Naturally dried durian rinds were pulped according to Soda-Anthraquinone (Soda-AQ) pulping process with a condition of 20 % active alkali, 0. 1 % AQ, 7 : 1 liquor to material ratio, 120 minutes cooking time and 170 °C cooking temperature. The <b>linerboard</b> and corrugated medium paper with a basis weight of 120 gsm were prepared and evaluated according to Malaysian International Organization for Standardization (MS ISO) and Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI). The {{results indicate that the}} characteristics of durian rind <b>linerboard</b> are comparable with other wood or non-wood based paper and current commercial paper. However, low CMT value for corrugated medium and water absorptiveness quality for <b>linerboard</b> could be improved in future. Based on the bulk density (0. 672 g/cm 3), burst index (3. 12 kPa. m 2 /g) and RCT (2. 00 N. m 2 /g), the durian rind has shown a good potential and suitable as an alternative raw material source for <b>linerboard</b> industry...|$|E
40|$|Waterproofing of {{corrugated}} packaging with wax or polyethylene hinders recyclability and so {{is incompatible}} with current socioeconomic goals of sustainability. Therefore, alternative coating technologies are sought. This study describes our feasibility study of electrohydrodynamic spraying (EHS) towards waterproofing corrugated boxes. Water resistance properties of electro-sprayed polymer-solvent solutions and latex systems air dried onto <b>linerboard</b> surface are reported. Optimization of spraying parameters led to observations of applied coating roughening on a nano-to-micron scale that correlated with increased water contact angle of the treated <b>linerboard.</b> An EHS latex formulation, compared to polymer solvent system, has shown better adhesion to <b>linerboard.</b> EHS application of latex produced a surface coating texture of droplets, which minimizes liquid water absorption, forming a nanopore matrix (of 3 – 50 nm diameter pores) that enabled the transmission of water vapor. <b>Linerboard</b> treated by EHS latex was advantageously found to be comparatively transpiring to water vapor at room temperature and refrigeration conditions, which is encouraging for commercial application of the technique...|$|E
