5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E

50|$|In his 1807 Almanach des Gourmands, gastronomist Grimod de La Reynière {{presents}} his rôti sans pareil ("roast without equal")—a bustard {{stuffed with}} a turkey, a goose, a pheasant, a chicken, a duck, a guinea fowl, a teal, a woodcock, a partridge, a plover, a lapwing, a quail, a thrush, a lark, an ortolan bunting and a garden warbler—although he states that, since similar roasts were produced by ancient Romans, the rôti sans pareil {{was not entirely}} novel. The final bird is very small but <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> just <b>hold</b> an olive; it also suggests that, unlike modern multi-bird roasts, there was no stuffing or other packing placed in between the birds.|$|R
25|$|In 1903 another hospice for Russian pilgrims was built, the Nikolai Pilgrims Hospice, {{which was}} <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 1,200 guests.

60|$|Perhaps not; but a {{large piece}} of glass had broken into the slender little calf, and Leonard steadied himself to {{withdraw}} it, as, happily, the fragment was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give a <b>hold</b> for his hand.

50|$|The victory {{guaranteed}} Swedish {{control of}} the lagoon, which they exploited by capturing the island of Wollin. However, their ultimate goal of Stettin remained in Prussian hands. Undaunted, the Prussians began {{to build a new}} fleet. The Battle of Frisches Haff was thus a short-lived victory for the Swedes and the Russian retreat from the war of 1762 placed them in a very difficult situation. Realising they did not have a <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> force <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off the redoubtable troops under king Frederick II of Prussia on their own, the Swedes proposed a peace settlement to him based on a return to the pre-war status quo. Frederick accepted the proposal and formalised it by signing the treaty of Hamburg on 22 May 1762.|$|R
5000|$|At this point, Baker {{had about}} 40 men with him. His company built fortifications {{along the east}} bank of the Brazos, {{directly}} {{across the river from}} San Felipe. By March 31, they had dug an L-shaped ditch, 124 yd long, and piled tree branches in front. [...] Two days later, Baker's men found four survivors from Fannin's regiment wandering the prairie. The men had escaped after the Battle of Refugio and were searching {{for the remainder of the}} Texian army. [...] One of the survivors, Samuel G. Hardaway, joined Baker's company. [...] Baker requested reinforcements <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the San Felipe crossing, and within days had about 120 men under his command.

25|$|While the {{specific}} {{plant and equipment}} utilized by Lawrence & Foulks is not known, wooden shipbuilding firms in this era could be established for a remarkably small outlayas little as $11,000, and rarely more than $20,000. Tradesmen at this time mostly supplied their own tools, so a shipyard needed {{little more than a}} waterfront property <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a timber yard and a slipway or two, a derrick to lift heavy components, a large crosscut saw and a few other tools.|$|E
25|$|The CL.II was a single-engined biplane, with an all-wooden structure. The {{fuselage}} {{was covered}} with thin plywood panelling and housed the crew of two in a single cockpit, with the observer's 7.92mm (.312in) machine gun being mounted on an elevated gun ring, giving a good field of fire, allowing downwards fire at targets on the ground. A tray <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> ten stick grenades {{was attached to the}} left side of the fuselage. The single-bay wings were fabric-covered, with a swept upper wing.|$|E

The $230 million project was funded with gifts from Joan and Sanford I. Weill and the Weill Family Fund, Judith and Burton Resnick, Lily Safra and other donors, as well as $52.2 million from the city, $11 million from the state and $56.5 million from bonds issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York.|$|E
50|$|In May 1966, an {{innovative}} attack, Operation Carolina Moon, was planned by the US Air Force. A new weapon {{was to be}} used: a large magnetic mine, that implemented a new energy mass-focusing concept. The plan was to float the mines down the river, till they reached the bridge, where the magnetic sensors would set off the charges, hopefully wrecking it permanently. The only aircraft with a <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>hold</b> <b>to</b> carry these weapons was the slow-flying C-130 Hercules transport, so the operation was due to take place at night, to reduce its vulnerability.|$|R
60|$|The {{refreshing}} meal, {{the brilliant}} fire, {{the presence and}} kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart <b>large</b> <b>enough,</b> vigorous <b>enough,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.|$|R
50|$|Because of Preservation Hall, Nelson now had {{permanent}} work, {{exposure to}} a new audience, and was provided numerous opportunities for travel abroad as both a soloist and band member of the Billie and De De Piece and Kid Thomas Valentine's bands. Noel Rockmore began his series of portraits of the musicians who played at the hall. Many adorned the hall, but jazz devotees who were art collectors such as John M. van Beuren (who maintained a residence in the building that housed the hall on the first floor), purchased the paintings for other residences, often {{in other parts of}} the country. van Beuren had a grand home built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Morristown, New Jersey that had a living room <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> in which <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> private concerts while the band stayed at van Beuren's home when playing jigs in Manhattan.

25|$|As Krypton's {{destruction}} approaches, Jor-El {{still has}} not built a rocket <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> his family. With the planet coming apart beneath them, Jor-El and Lara put their two-year-old son in a model rocket, launch it just minutes ahead of Krypton's destruction, and send Kal-El to the planet Earth. Found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, an older couple with no children of their own, the child is anonymously left at a Smallville orphanage. Some days later, the Kents successfully adopt the toddler. They name the boy Clark Kent, using Martha's maiden name for his first name.|$|E
25|$|The less casual shirts in Britain {{will have}} no pockets, but the {{standard}} shirt in America has a single one on the wearer's left side, which is a sewn-on patch with a plain upper hem, optionally with a single button for closure. This small pocket is <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{a pack of cigarettes}} or a few pens (a pocket protector can be used). Less formal shirts may feature larger pockets, dual pockets, or pockets with flap closures; safari or other military styled shirts often feature two large pockets with buttoned flaps. Less formal shirts may have small pockets on the sleeves as well. Shoulder straps are virtually non-existent on formal shirts, with the exception of military clothing.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1885 of masonry and timber, the Simms {{building}} {{exhibits a}} combination of Gothic and Georgian features; the projecting central tower and wings are reminiscent of Georgian designs, while the façade's soaring verticals, griffins, and pointed arch openings, are Gothic. The building at Hope was designed {{at the time to}} accommodate boarders as well as day students, and was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the whole school without difficulty. It now houses the administrative offices, staff room and sixth form classrooms. For over a hundred years, Simms Hall has been the core of the Jamaica College buildings, its strength and durability repeatedly demonstrated by its resistance to hurricanes and earthquakes, including the disastrous Kingston earthquake of 1907.|$|E
50|$|While in New Orleans, {{he played}} {{regularly}} at Preservation Hall from its opening in 1961 until {{shortly before his}} death late in 1968. Paintings of him performing were painted by New Orleans artists and, sitting portraits, notably those by Noel Rockmore, sold to collectors. Rockmore painted a long series of portraits of the musicians who played at the hall. Many adorned the hall, but jazz devotees who were art collectors, such as John M. van Beuren (who maintained a residence in the building that housed the hall on the first floor), purchased the siting portraits for other residences, often {{in other parts of the}} country. van Beuren had a grand home built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Morristown, New Jersey that had a living room <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> in which <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> private concerts while the musicians stayed at van Beuren's home when playing gigs in Manhattan.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{technology}} of fermented milk products, {{the ability to}} form exopolysaccharides (EPS) is a basic criterion {{to be used for}} the selection of starter cultures, together with their capacity to produce lactic acid, aroma substances, stability and texture. This paper aimed at screening lactic acid bacteria to be used as starter cultures for yogurt production based on their ability to biosynthesized exopolysaccharides. In case of the YF-L 812 starter culture, the ability to synthesize EPS depended on the dry matter (DM) of the milk: a quantity of 93 mg EPS/l was recorded for the whole milk reconstituted to 14. 5 % DM and 80 mg EPS/l for the sample reconstituted to 11. 5 % DM. The investigation at the microstructure level revealed that yogurt obtained from reconstituted milk to 14. 5 % DM had a dense network gel with a high syneresis phenomenon, whereas yogurt made from reconstituted milk to 11. 5 % DM formed a network gel with <b>large</b> alveolar cavity <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the entire amount of whey...|$|R

25|$|There was {{an initial}} burst of activity, with the commissioners asking John Aram and Langley Edwards {{to produce a}} survey and {{estimate}} {{the cost of the}} work in June 1751, which was duly produced. The men recommended canalising some stretches of the river, and suggested that seven staunches and a pen sluice would be needed. A large basin would be constructed close to West Acre bridge. No further action was taken until 1757, when a treasurer was appointed. He advertised for subscribers, who would receive the toll revenues, and Langley Edwards was appointed to carry out the work. The navigation would be suitable for lighters holding 10 tonnes, and the locks would be <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a single lighter.|$|E
25|$|Within {{six months}} of coming into ownership, the King began his own {{rebuilding}} and expansion. Henry VIII's court consisted of over one thousand people, while the King owned over sixty houses and palaces. Few of these were <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the assembled court, and thus {{one of the first}} of the King's building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide bouche of court for his entire court. The architecture of King Henry's new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This hybrid architecture was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until Inigo Jones introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.|$|E
25|$|In 637 Arabs besieged and {{captured}} {{the city from}} the Byzantine Empire, which had defeated the Persian forces and their allies, and reconquered the city. There are no contemporary records, but many traditions, {{about the origin of}} the main Islamic buildings on the mount. A popular account from later centuries is that the Rashidun Caliph Umar was led to the place reluctantly by the Christian patriarch Sophronius. He found it covered with rubbish, but the sacred Rock was found {{with the help of a}} converted Jew, Ka'b al-Ahbar. Al-Ahbar advised Umar to build a mosque to the north of the rock, so that worshippers would face both the rock and Mecca, but instead Umar chose to build it to the south of the rock. It became known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque. According to Muslim sources, Jews participated in the construction of the haram, laying the groundwork for both the Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques. The first known eyewitness testimony is that of the pilgrim Arculf who visited about 670. According to Arculf's account as recorded by Adomnán, he saw a rectangular wooden house of prayer built over some ruins, <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 3,000 people.|$|E

500|$|Monopoly {{was first}} marketed {{on a broad}} scale by Parker Brothers in 1935. A Standard Edition, with a small black box and {{separate}} board, and a larger Deluxe Edition, with a box <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the board, were sold {{in the first year}} of Parker Brothers' ownership. These were based on the two editions sold by Darrow. Parker Brothers sets were the first to include die-cast metal tokens for playing pieces, initially using a battleship, a cannon, a clothes iron, a shoe, a top hat, and a thimble. George Parker himself rewrote many of the game's rules, insisting that [...] "short game" [...] and [...] "time limit" [...] rules be included. On the original Parker Brothers board (reprinted in 2002 by Winning Moves Games), there were no icons for the Community Chest spaces (the blue chest overflowing with gold coins came later) and no gold ring on the Luxury Tax space. Nor were there property values printed on spaces on the board. The Income Tax was slightly higher (being $300 or 10%, instead of the later $200 or 10%). Some of the designs known today were implemented at the behest of George Parker. The Chance cards and Community Chest cards were illustrated (though some prior editions consisted solely of text), but were without [...] "Rich Uncle Pennybags", who was introduced in 1936.|$|E
500|$|Before Devers' arrival, Armored Force {{doctrine}} emphasized light tanks weighing no {{more than}} [...] American doctrine held that tanks were for exploitation, not fighting other tanks. He rejected the M6 heavy tank and recommended to McNair that it be cancelled, citing its tremendous weight and concerns about its mobility and reliability. This was seen as support for this position, but Devers wanted a medium tank, preferably mounting something like a 105mm howitzer. He was appalled {{to find that the}} Armored Force's tanks were armed with nothing heavier than a 37mm gun. A new medium tank was beginning to come off the production line: the M3 Lee. Devers observed testing of one just days after taking command, and was unimpressed. American industry was unable to cast a turret <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a 75mm gun, so the M3 carried a 37mm gun, with a 75mm in a sponson. This gave it a limited traverse, rendering it difficult to engage moving targets. To make matters worse, the designers shortened the barrel to improve the M3's mobility, which Devers realized also reduced the gun's muzzle velocity, and hence its effectiveness against armor. In practice, M3 crews attempted to engage German armor with the 75mm, as the 37mm was ineffective against it. It was found that the 75mm could penetrate the frontal armor of German tanks at , but German tanks destroyed M3s at up to [...] Devers pronounced the M3 [...] "overweight, underpowered, and insufficiently armed".|$|E
