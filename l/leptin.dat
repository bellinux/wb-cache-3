5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} <b>leptin.</b> <b>Leptin</b> inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in <b>leptin</b> signaling, either via <b>leptin</b> deficiency or <b>leptin</b> resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the <b>leptin</b> gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While <b>leptin</b> and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone <b>leptin,</b> which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Prominent alumni in {{the field}} of science include Douglas L. Coleman, who {{discovered}} <b>leptin,</b> Richard Bader, noted for his work on the atoms in molecules theory, Harold E. Johns, who pioneered the use of cobalt-60 in the treatment of cancer, Karl Clark, who pioneered the separation method to extract bitumen from the oil sands, and Steve Mann, a researcher and inventor {{in the field}} of computational photography. Notable faculty members include chemist Ronald Gillespie, who helped shape VSEPR theory, as well as David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, whose research team was largely credited for largely establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. Prominent alumni {{in the field of}} social sciences was Harold Innis, who helped shape communication theory and the staples thesis, and sociologist Henry Giroux, one of the founding theorists of critical pedagogy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptin,</b> however, plays a {{different}} role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce <b>leptin,</b> <b>leptin</b> levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and- when <b>leptin</b> levels drop due to weight loss- hunger increases. The drop of <b>leptin</b> is better {{viewed as a}} starvation signal than the rise of <b>leptin</b> as a satiety signal. However, elevated <b>leptin</b> in obesity is known as <b>leptin</b> resistance. The changes {{that occur in the}} hypothalamus to result in <b>leptin</b> resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Jeffrey Friedman, in his {{residency}} at the Rockefeller University, {{together with}} Rudolph Leibel, Douglas Coleman et al. discovered the protein <b>leptin</b> that the genetically obese mouse lacked. <b>Leptin</b> {{is produced in}} the white adipose tissue and signals to the hypothalamus. When <b>leptin</b> levels drop, the body interprets this as a loss of energy, and hunger increases. Mice lacking this protein eat until they are four times their normal size.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the GnRH rise is unknown. <b>Leptin</b> might be the {{cause of the}} GnRH rise. <b>Leptin</b> has receptors in the {{hypothalamus}} which synthesizes GnRH. Individuals who are deficient in <b>leptin</b> fail to initiate puberty. The levels of <b>leptin</b> increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both Neurokinin B as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of Kisspeptin, a compound responsible for triggering direct release of GnRH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH.|$|E
25|$|During the night, {{melatonin}} regulates <b>leptin,</b> lowering its levels.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{defects in}} the <b>leptin</b> gene (ob) are rare in human obesity. As of July, 2010, only 14 {{individuals}} from five {{families have been}} identified worldwide who carry a mutated ob gene (one {{of which was the}} first ever identified cause of genetic obesity in humans)—two families of Pakistani origin living in the UK, one family living in Turkey, one in Egypt, and one in Austria—and two other families have been found that carry a mutated ob receptor. Others have been identified as genetically partially deficient in <b>leptin,</b> and, in these individuals, <b>leptin</b> levels on {{the low end of the}} normal range can predict obesity.|$|E
25|$|Obesity can unfavorably alter {{hormonal}} and metabolic status via {{resistance to}} the hormone <b>leptin,</b> and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fueled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, {{as a result of}} high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and <b>leptin</b> normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced <b>leptin</b> signaling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptin</b> is {{a protein}} hormone {{produced}} by adipose tissue. Its primary target organ is the hypothalamus. The <b>leptin</b> level seems {{to provide the}} brain a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of sleep}} {{increases}} ghrelin, and decreases <b>leptin,</b> both effects producing increased hunger and obesity.|$|E
25|$|Blood-borne stimuli, {{including}} <b>leptin,</b> ghrelin, angiotensin, insulin, pituitary hormones, cytokines, plasma {{concentrations of}} glucose and osmolarity etc.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{mechanisms}} by which AMPK is inhibited by insulin, <b>leptin,</b> and diacylglycerol by inducing various other phosphorylations.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} fat organs, {{subcutaneous}} fat {{is an active}} part of the endocrine system, secreting the hormones <b>leptin</b> and resistin.|$|E

25|$|Fairly recently, LKB1 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a likely AMP kinase kinase, which appears to involve calcium/calmodulin signaling. This pathway likely transduces signals from <b>leptin,</b> adiponectin, and other signaling molecules.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{growth factor}} {{signaling}} in {{the interaction between}} stromal cells and epithelial cells can facilitate malignant cell growth. In breast adipose tissue, overexpression of <b>leptin</b> leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.|$|E
25|$|Several {{mutations}} {{of genes}} involving the melanocortins (used in brain signaling associated with appetite) and their receptors {{have also been}} identified as causing obesity in a larger {{portion of the population}} than <b>leptin</b> mutations.|$|E
25|$|Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered {{signalling}} of peptides {{that facilitate}} {{communication between the}} gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, <b>leptin,</b> neuropeptide Y and orexin, {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular stimuli {{are carried}} by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, {{including}} for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or promote feeding, by signalling the release of <b>leptin</b> or gastrin, respectively. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Lipostatic {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{holds that}} adipose tissue produces a humoral signal that is proportionate {{to the amount}} of fat and acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output. It has been evident that a hormone <b>leptin</b> acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output.|$|E
25|$|José F. Caro, M.D. (born Granada, Spain, 1948) is an American physician, scientist, and {{educator}} {{most notable}} for his research in obesity and diabetes. The Institute for Scientific Information listed him {{the third most}} cited investigator {{in the world in}} the field of obesity research during the 1991-2000 period for his work on <b>Leptin.</b> Caro is also an artist.|$|E
25|$|Signals {{arising from}} the {{long-term}} nutrient reservoir of the body may alter {{the sensitivity of the}} brain to hunger signals or short-term satiety signals. A peptide, <b>leptin,</b> has profound effects on metabolism and eating. It is secreted by adipose tissue and it increases metabolic rate while decreasing food intake. Its discovery has stimulated interest in finding ways of treating obesity.|$|E
25|$|HMG-CoA reductase {{is active}} when blood glucose is high. The basic {{functions}} of insulin and glucagon are to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect {{the activity of}} HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which responds {{to an increase in}} AMP concentration, and also to <b>leptin</b> (see 4.4, Phosphorylation of reductase).|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how all {{peptides}} that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and <b>leptin,</b> there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain {{is not clear}}. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} about how {{and to what extent}} {{different}} dietary factors— such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals—contribute to the development of insulin and <b>leptin</b> resistance. In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain homeostasis, the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).|$|E
25|$|Normal puberty is {{initiated}} in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus {{is an ongoing}} active suppression by {{other areas of the}} brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition {{have been the subject of}} investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. <b>Leptin</b> levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuits}} in {{the brain}} stem are able to control acceptance or rejection of sweet or bitter foods, and can be modulated by satiation or physiological hunger signals. Signals from the tongue, stomach, small intestine and liver are received by the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract, which then send information to many regions of the forebrain that control food intake. The lateral hypothalamus contains two sets of neurons that increase eating and decrease metabolic rate by secreting the peptides orexin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the lateral hypothalamus induces ravenous eating; neurons that secrete NPY are targeted by ghrelin in the hypothalamus. <b>Leptin</b> desensitizes the brain to hunger signals and inhibits NPY-secreting neurons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift. Modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes but all of them together explain only between 1.4 and 10% of population variance. This leaves a large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of heritability of obesity and Type 2 diabetes: sometimes called the 'missing heritability'. The reasons for this discrepancy are not completely understood. A likely possibility is that the missing heritability is explained by rare variants of large effect that are found only in limited populations. These would be impossible to detect by standard whole genome sequencing approaches even with hundreds of thousands of participants. The extreme endpoint of this distribution are the so-called 'monogenic' obesities where most of the impact on body weight can be tied to a mutation in a single gene that runs in a single family. The classic example of such a genetic effect is the presence of mutations in the <b>leptin</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 and, to a lesser degree, PLSCR1 are critical to the normal regulation of fat accumulation in mice. In addition to blood cells, PLSCR3 is expressed to a significantly higher level in fat and muscle cells, which are actively involved in fat metabolism. PLSCR3 knockout mice showed an aberrant abdominal fat accumulation, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidema as compared to controlled mice. Cultured fat cells from PLSCR3 knockout mice were engorged with neutral lipids. Blood plasma of these mice showed elevated levels of non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and <b>leptin,</b> but low adiponectin content. Abdominal fat accumulation {{with the formation of}} enlarged lipid engorged adipocytes has emerged as the key risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is often a manifestation of a broader underlying metabolic disorder termed as metabolic syndrome. Further studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism by PLSCRs are required to understand the risk for development of similar diseases in humans when PLSCR genes are mutated, leading to a defective expression and/or function of PLSCR proteins.|$|E
25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, {{adipose tissue}} (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or body fat or fat depot or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as <b>leptin,</b> resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial <b>Leptin</b> resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Oral mucosa heals {{faster than}} skin, {{suggesting}} that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived tissue factor, and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary tissue factor, associated with microvesicles shed from {{cells in the}} mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing. Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, VEGF, TGF-β1, <b>leptin,</b> IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-α induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the negative consequences of}} sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones <b>leptin,</b> pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). [...] In {{addition to}} these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (<b>leptin,</b> pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.|$|E
