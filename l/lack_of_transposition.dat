Indeed, despite numerous Treaty reforms and several enlargements, this control is still governed by the same principles. First, I have tried to analyse the different mechanisms to control this application: ex-ante mechanism such as the notification Directive (98 / 34 /EC), ex-post mechanism such as infringement actions and hybrid mechanism such as Solvit. Second, I have proposed several ideas {{in order to improve}} the current situation. One of the main arguments is to suggest a new mechanism able to deal with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> of Directives. Furthermore other aspects are explored such as the necessity to include the European Parliament in the control of the application of European law. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a patient who {{recovered}} from a clinical picture of fluent aphasia to selective dysgraphia. The features of the writing disorder were compatible with a graphemic output buffer dysfunction (errors in all spelling tasks and for all type of material, affected by word length and consist-ing mostly of graphemic deviations), {{with the exception of the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> errors and position preference. Further, the spelling disorder was selective for vowels, replicating the original observation by Cubelli (1991). A similar, although milder, error pattern was also observed in reading tasks, in particular for nonwords, suggesting that the locus of dysfunction involves a processing stage shared by reading and writing. These findings support the notion that the consonant-vowel status is a property of graphemic representations, and is compatible with that a common buffer is involved in spelling and reading. We discuss the implications of selective vowel disorders for current models of the spelling system...|$|E
40|$|Extremely thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeota {{belonging}} to the order Sulfolobales flourish in hot acidic habitats that are strongly oxidizing. The pH extremes of these habitats, however, often exceed the acid tolerance of type species and strains. Here, adaptive laboratory evolution was used over a 3 -year period to test whether such organisms harbor additional thermoacidophilic capacity. Three distinct cell lines derived from a single type species were subjected to high-temperature serial passage while culture acidity was gradually increased. A 178 -fold increase in thermoacidophily was achieved after 29 increments of shifted culture pH resulting in growth at pH 0. 8 and 80 °C. These strains were named super-acid-resistant Crenarchaeota (SARC). Mathematical modeling using growth parameters predicted the limits of acid resistance, while genome resequencing and transcriptome resequencing were conducted for insight into mechanisms responsible for the evolved trait. Among the mutations that were detected, a set of eight nonsynonymous changes may explain the heritability of increased acid resistance despite an unexpected <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition.</b> Four multigene components of the SARC transcriptome implicated oxidative stress as a primary challenge accompanying growth at acid extremes. These components included accelerated membrane biogenesis, induction of the mer operon, and an increased capacity for the generation of energy and reductant...|$|E
40|$|Numbers of copia {{transcripts}} in testes {{of files}} from five Drosophila melanogaster lines were compared {{by means of}} Northern blot hybridization. Four of these lines were closely related differing only by transposition rates {{and the number of}} copia sites in the genome. The fifth line, which was not related to the others, was characterized by <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>transpositions</b> and the lowest copia copy number. Positive correlation between total copia transcript level and its copy number and transposition rate was observed. Therefore, transcription rate of copia retrotransposon in tests is largely controlled by the level of its transcription, which, in turn, is regulated by the number of retrotransposon copies in the genome. These data contradict the hypothesis on self-regulation of retrotransposon copy number in the genome...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of transposable element (TE) {{insertion}} in the production of mutations with mild effects on fitness, the class of mutations thought to be central to the evolution of many basic features of natural populations. We propagated mutation-accumulation (MA) lines of two RNAi-deficient strains of Caenorhabditis elegans that exhibit germline transposition. We show here that the impact of TE activity was to raise the level of mildly deleterious mutation by 2 - to 8. 5 -fold, as estimated from fecundity, longevity, and body length measurements, compared to that observed in a parallel MA experiment with a control strain characterized by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> germline <b>transposition.</b> Despite this increase, the rate of mildly deleterious mutation was between one and two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of TE accumulation, which was approximately two new insertions per genome per generation. This study suggests that high rates of TE activity do not necessarily translate into high rates of detectable nonlethal mutation...|$|R
40|$|Based upon ultrastructural {{findings}} and computed tomography, a presumptive diagnosis of feline primary ciliary dyskinesia {{was made in}} a 2. 5 -year-old cat. The cat demonstrated morphologic alterations in the ultrastructure of oviductal cilia. In the oviduct, axonemal abnormalities were detected in 132 (20 %) of 660 cross-sectioned cilia. The main ultrastructural ciliary defects were a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> central microtubules, <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> peripheral doublets {{to the center of}} the axoneme, supernumerary microtubules, and morphologic abnormalities of peripheral doublets. Computed tomography of the chest was consistent with early lesions of bronchiectasis, suggesting chronic stagnation of respiratory secretions, attributed to abnormal function of respiratory cilia. Specifically, the cranial branches of the cat's bronchi were wider and thicker than those of five healthy controls. Foci of pleural thickening and interstitial enlargement were also observed...|$|R
40|$|Background: During history, mentally disordered {{offenders}} {{have been}} in focus regarding responsibility for their crimes and imposition of punishment. The boundary stone of legal consequences for mentally ill offenders has been moved between ethical aspects and the possible link between crime and mental disorder. The current legislation, with a special sanction for mentally ill offenders, was revised 1992, introducing a narrower legal concept for forensic psychiatric treatment. Objectives: The overall aim was to describe how the variation in offenders with mental disorders, in different sanctions, {{was related to the}} outcome of criminality. Specific aims were to (1) compare the intention of the restricted criteria of mental illness in the Forensic Mental Care Act of 1992 with the actual outcome, (2) quantify early criminal recidivism in different forms of sanctions, and (3) to investigate possible predictive factors for long-term violent criminal recidivism. Methods and Results: A population-based cohort of men with mental disorders, referred for a pre-trial forensic psychiatric investigation before, and after the change in law, 1992, were compared. Contrary to the expectation, there were more treatment sanctions in the group 1993 - 95 due to more psychotic disorders (1). The incidence rates of crimes during two years after sentencing were compared between the study subjects in forensic psychiatric treatment, prison and non-custodial sanctions. These rates of crimes and specifically violent crimes were lower during the entire treatment sanction, compared to the two other groups, also at the diagnoses, which were most related to criminality (2). During the long-term course (13 - 20 years) of violent recidivism, the role of index sanction disappeared, but differed between diagnostic groups, analyzed by Kaplan-Meier. A Cox regression analysis showed that the risk for violent recidivism was predicted by crime-related factors (3). Discussion & Conclusion:The increase in treatment sanctions after the new law may be associated with a fast reduction in hospital beds and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> of support facilities to the social service. As long as treatment sanctions was ongoing criminality was reduced, but for violent recidivism in the long run, previous crime-related characteristics were important factors.

40|$|SummaryTransposable {{elements}} {{have been}} routinely used for genetic manipulation in lower organisms, including generating transgenic animals and insertional mutagenesis. In contrast, {{the usage of}} transposons in mice and other vertebrate systems is still limited due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an efficient <b>transposition</b> system. We have tested the ability of piggyBac (PB), a DNA transposon from the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni, to transpose in mammalian systems. We show that PB elements carrying multiple genes can efficiently transpose in human and mouse cell lines and also in mice. PB permits {{the expression of the}} marker genes it carried. During germline transposition, PB could excise precisely from original insertion sites and transpose into the mouse genome at diverse locations, preferably transcription units. These data provide a first and critical step toward a highly efficient transposon system for a variety of genetic manipulations including transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis in mice and other vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Transposable Elements (TEs) {{make up the}} {{majority}} of plant genomes, and thus understanding TE evolutionary dynamics is key to understanding plant genome evolution. Plant reproductive systems are diverse and mating type variation is one factor among many hypothesized to influence TE evolutionary dynamics. Here, we collected a large TE-display data set in self-fertilizing Arabidopsis thaliana, and compared it to data gathered in outcrossing Arabidopsis lyrata. We analyzed seven TE families in four natural populations of each species to tease apart the effects of mating system, demography, transposition, and selection in determining patterns of TE diversity. Results Measures of TE band differentiation were largely consistent across TE families. However, patterns of diversity in A. thaliana Ac elements differed significantly from that other TEs, perhaps signaling a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> recent <b>transposition.</b> Across TE families, we estimated higher allele frequencies and lower selection coefficients on A. thaliana TE insertions relative to A. lyrat a TE insertions. Conclusions The differences in TE distributions between the two Arabidopsis species represents a synthesis of evolutionary forces that include the <b>transposition</b> dynamics <b>of</b> individual TE families and the demographic histories of populations. There are also species-specific differences that could be attributed to the effects of mating system, including higher overall allele frequencies in the selfing lineage and a greater proportion of among population TE diversity in the outcrossing lineage. </p...|$|R

The reversal operation works on a single segment of the genome by reversing the selected segment. Two kinds <b>of</b> <b>transpositions</b> have been studied in the literature.

In this paper, we introduce a third transposition operation which works on two consecutive segments and study sorting of a signed permutation by reversals and transpositions.
