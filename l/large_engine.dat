5|$|Installing such a <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E

25|$|The pure {{style of}} the {{prototype}} was progressively altered by {{the evolution of the}} car to improve its performance, handling, tractability, and ability to meet mandated requirements. This began with the first production model, which included several vents that Lamborghini found necessary to cool the engine adequately. These included the iconic NACA duct on the doors and rear fenders. The car design changes ended with a <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> vent directly behind the driver, reducing the rear view. Later additions—including fender flares, spoilers, carburetor covers, and bumpers—progressively changed the car's aesthetic values.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 American Honda's {{service manager}} Bob Hansen flew to Japan and {{discussed}} with Soichiro Honda {{the possibility of}} using Grand Prix technology in bikes prepared for American motorcycle events. American racing's governing body, the AMA, had rules that allowed racing by production machines only, and restricted overhead-valve engines to 500cc whilst allowing the side-valve Harley Davidsons to compete with 750cc engines. Honda knew that what won on the race track today, sold in the show rooms tomorrow, and a <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> capacity road machine would have to be built to compete with the Harley Davidson and Triumph twin-cylinder machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{large house}} {{situated}} halfway along the dam wall was originally the weirmaster's cottage. The weirmaster would {{walk up to}} the hexagonal valve house, constructed to the same design as BCN tollhouses, and operate the gate valves to release water from Chasewater reservoir into the canal. The construction of the M6 Toll between the reservoir and the A5 required {{the construction of a new}} bridge over the motorway to access the southern side of the lake, where an Innovation Centre provides enhanced access to the waterfront. Selling land for motorway construction also allowed the Chasewater Railway to construct new premises and a <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> shed on the lake side.|$|E

500|$|Republic Aviation {{started the}} Thunderchief as an {{internal}} project {{to replace the}} RF-84F Thunderflash, which first used the characteristic wing-root air intakes to place cameras in a pointed nose. The design team led by Alexander Kartveli examined some 108 configurations before settling on a large, single-engine AP-63FBX (Advanced Project 63 Fighter Bomber, Experimental), specifically AP-63-31. The new aircraft was intended primarily for supersonic, low altitude penetration to deliver a single, internally carried nuclear bomb. The {{emphasis was placed on}} low-altitude speed and flight characteristics, range, and payload. The aircraft would be fitted with a <b>large</b> <b>engine,</b> and a relatively small wing with a high wing loading for a stable ride at low altitudes, and less drag at supersonic speeds. Traditional fighter attributes such as maneuverability were a secondary consideration.|$|E
500|$|Cooling this <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> whilst minimising {{aerodynamic}} drag posed new challenges {{for both the}} Rolls-Royce and Supermarine design teams. Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb-type radiators were known to cause high drag in flight; consequently {{it was decided to}} use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and floats as heat exchangers, employing a double-skinned structure through which the coolant could circulate. Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the fuselage and empennage skins. The S.6 was described at the time as a [...] "flying radiator", and it had been estimated that this coolant system dissipated the equivalent of 1,000hp (745kW) of heat in flight. However, even with this system in use, engine overheating was noted during the race flights, requiring the pilots to reduce the throttle setting to maintain a safe operating temperature.|$|E

500|$|Frost {{felt the}} {{excellent}} {{performance of his}} new engine would be a natural fit for a VTOL aircraft due to its high expected power-to-weight ratio. The problem was {{how to use the}} annular thrust to drive the aircraft forward, as well as the problem of fitting the very <b>large</b> <b>engine</b> into a suitable airframe. Frost suggested using a series of ducts and vents to redirect the thrust flowing out of the front of the engine towards the rear. In order to keep the pipes as short as possible, the design ported the thrust out along the leading edge of what was essentially a thick delta wing. As the engine was disk-shaped, the triangular delta shape was pushed out near the front where it met the engine disk, producing a shape roughly like a spade on a playing card. For this reason the design was also referred to as the [...] "Avro Ace," [...] a likely reference to the Ace of Spades.|$|E

The aircraft was designed for {{vertical take-off and landing}} which was thought to be hazardous and required an electronic flight-stabilization system, then not-yet available.
