50|$|In photography, a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> is {{a camera}} lens {{which has a}} focal length that is longer than the {{diagonal}} measure of the film or sensor that receives its image. It is used to make distant objects appear magnified with magnification increasing as longer focal length lenses are used. A <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> {{is one of three}} basic photographic lens types classified by relative focal length, the other two being a normal lens and a wide-angle lens.As with other types of camera lenses, the focal length is usually expressed in a millimeter value written on the lens, for example: a 500 mm lens. The most common type of <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> is the telephoto lens, which incorporate a special lens group known as a telephoto group to make the physical length of the lens shorter than the focal length.|$|E
50|$|In {{photography}} and cinematography, a telephoto lens {{is a specific}} type of a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> in which the physical length of the lens is shorter than the focal length. This is achieved by incorporating a special lens group known as a telephoto group that extends the light path to create a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> in a much shorter overall design. The angle of view and other effects of long-focus lenses are the same for telephoto lenses of the same specified focal length. Long-focal-length lenses are often informally referred to as telephoto lenses although this is technically incorrect: a telephoto lens specifically incorporates the telephoto group.|$|E
5000|$|Few TLR cameras offered {{interchangeable}} lenses and none {{were made with}} a zoom lens. In systems with {{interchangeable lenses}}, such as the Mamiya, the fixed distance between the lenses sets a hard limit on their size, which precludes the possibility of large aperture <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the {{invention}} of photography in the 19th century, images have been captured using standard optical telescopes including telescope objectives adapted as early portrait lenses. Besides being used in an astronomical role in astrophotography, telescopes are adapted as <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> in nature photography, surveillance, machine vision and long-focus microscopy.|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} based on two case studies of {{publishing}} houses in Shanghai. As Yin (2009) maintains that case studies allow {{not only for the}} examination of particular complexities in a case but also enable researchers to gain insights into larger systematic issues—an appropriate methodology for researchers who want to look at an issue using both close- and <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Long-focus lens: any lens with a {{focal length}} {{longer than the}} {{diagonal}} measure of the film or sensor. Angle of view is narrower. The {{most common type of}} <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> is the telephoto lens, a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length.|$|E
50|$|Telephoto lens - an {{optically}} compressed {{version of}} the <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens.</b> The design of telephoto lenses reduces {{some of the problems}} encountered by designers of long-focus lenses. In particular, telephoto lenses are typically much shorter and may be lighter for equivalent focal length and aperture. However telephoto designs increase the number of lens elements and can introduce flare and exacerbate some optical aberrations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> - a lens with a {{focal length}} {{greater than the}} {{diagonal}} of the film frame or sensor. Long focus lenses are relatively simple to design, the challenges being comparable {{to the design of}} a prime lens. However, as the focal length increases the length of the lens {{and the size of the}} objective increase in size and length and weight quickly become significant design issues in retaining utility and practicality for the lens in use. In addition because the light path through the lens is long and glancing, the importance of baffles to control flare increases in importance.|$|E
50|$|Louis XIV of France ordered several <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> (86, 100, 136 feet respectively) for the {{astronomer}} Giovanni Domenico Cassini.With these Cassini found several moons {{of the planet}} Saturn, among other discoveries.Constantijn Huygens, Jr., brother of Christiaan Huygens, acquired one of Campani's telescopes.While in London in 1689 he ordered a new tube for the instrument from the instrument maker John Marshall.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the {{meridian}} {{profile of the}} aspherical surface of a plane-convex lens excluding spherical aberration, without calculating the coefficients of the series, by direct solving the compiled differential equation is proposed. The differential equation of an aspherical lens was compiled, found its numerical solution, and got the meridian profile of an aspherical <b>lens.</b> For <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> found conditions to simplify the differential equation.

500|$|The third {{series was}} filmed across five blocks of two episodes, with a {{director}} in each block. Filming began in London in January 2004, {{and took up}} to 140 days spanning seven months. Each filming day typically lasted eleven hours. Scheduling was often tight throughout the shoot; sometimes the production crew had to [...] "double up" [...] on locations, and the cast often had to learn six pages of dialogue a day. The majority of cameras were handheld, and the filming crew {{used a variety of}} <b>lenses,</b> including <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> fisheye lenses, and swing and tilt lenses. The first two series was shot with a Fujifilm stock. The third series saw a switch to a new type of Kodak stock, becoming the first television series to use this model.|$|R
50|$|On any 35 mm film camera, a 28 mm lens is a {{wide-angle}} lens, and a 200 mm lens is a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens.</b> However, {{now that}} digital cameras have mostly replaced 35 mm cameras, {{there is no}} uniform relation between the focal length of a lens and the angle of view, since {{the size of the}} camera sensor also determines angle of view, and sensor size is not standardized as film size was. The 35 mm equivalent focal length of a particular lens-sensor combination is the focal length that one would need for a 35 mm film camera to obtain the same angle of view.|$|E
5000|$|But such simple lenses are not {{telephoto}} lenses, {{no matter}} how extreme the focal length - they are known as long-focus lenses. While the optical centre of a simple ("non-telephoto") lens is within the construction, the telephoto lens moves the optical centre {{in front of the}} construction.A telephoto lens works by having the outermost (i.e. light gathering) element of a much shorter focal length than the equivalent <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> and then incorporating a second set of elements close to the film or sensor plane that extend the cone of light so that it appears to have come from a lens of much greater focal length. The basic construction of a telephoto lens consists of front lens elements that, as a group, have a positive focus. The focal length of this group is shorter than the effective focal length of the lens. The converging rays from this group are intercepted by the rear lens group, sometimes called the [...] "telephoto group," [...] which has a negative focus. The simplest telephoto designs could consist of one element in each group, but in practice, more than one element is used in each group to correct for various aberrations. The combination of these two groups produces a lens assembly that is physically shorter than a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> producing the same image size. This same property is achieved in camera lenses that combine mirrors with lenses. These designs,called catadioptric, 'reflex', or 'mirror' lenses,have a curved mirror as the primary objective with some form of negative lens {{in front of the mirror}} to correct optical aberrations. They also use a curved secondary mirror to relay the image that extends the light cone the same way the negative lens telephoto group does. The mirrors also fold the light path. This makes them much shorter, lighter, and cheaper than an all refractive lens, but at the cost of some optical compromises due to aberrations caused by the central obstruction from the secondary mirror.|$|E
50|$|In 1883 or 1884 New Zealand {{photographer}} Alexander McKay {{discovered he}} {{could create a}} much more manageable <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> by combining a shorter focal length telescope objective lens with negative lenses and other optical parts from opera glasses to modify the light cone. Some of his photographs are preserved in the holdings of the Turnbull Library in Wellington, and two of these can be unequivocally dated as having been taken during May 1886. One of McKay’s photographs shows the Russian warship Vjestnik anchored in Wellington harbour {{about two and a}} half kilometres away, with its rigging lines and gun ports clearly visible. The other, taken from the same point, is of a local hotel, the Shepherds Arms, about 100 metres distant from the camera. The masts of the Vjestnik are visible in the background. McKay's other photographic achievements include photo-micrographs, and a ‘shadow-less technique’ for photographing fossils.|$|E
50|$|Very long focus lenses {{may require}} that the camera be fitted with special extra-long rails and bellows. Very short focal length {{wide-angle}} lenses may {{require that the}} standards be closer together than a normal concertina-folded bellows allows. Such a situation requires a bag bellows, a simple light-tight flexible bag. Recessed lensboards are also sometimes used to get the rear element of a wide angle lens {{close enough to the}} film plane; they may also be of use with telephoto lenses, since these compressed <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> may also have very small spacing between the back of the lens and the film plane.|$|R
50|$|Lenses {{with longer}} or shorter focal lengths produce an {{expanded}} or contracted {{field of view}} that appears to distort the perspective when viewed from a normal viewing distance. Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer-focal-length lenses {{are referred to as}} <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> (with the most common of that type being the telephoto lenses). Superimposing a wide-angle image print against the original scene would require holding it closer to the eye, while the telephoto image would need to be placed well into the depth of the photographed scene, or a tiny print to be held at arms-length, to match their perspectives.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{photographic}} zoom <b>lenses</b> are <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> with focal lengths {{longer than}} a normal lens, some are wide-angle lenses (wider than normal), and others cover a range from wide-angle to long-focus. Lenses in the latter group of zoom lenses, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "normal" [...] zooms, have displaced the fixed focal length lens as the popular one-lens selection on many contemporary cameras. The markings on these lenses usually say W and T for [...] "Wide" [...] and [...] "Telephoto". Telephoto is designated because the longer focal length supplied by the negative diverging lens is longer than the overall lens assembly (the negative diverging lens acting as the [...] "telephoto group").|$|R
50|$|Long-focus lenses {{are best}} known for making distant objects appear magnified. This effect is similar to moving closer to the object, but is not the same, since {{perspective}} is a function solely of viewing location. Two images taken from the same location, one with a wide angle lens {{and the other with}} a <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens,</b> will show identical perspective, in that near and far objects appear the same relative size to each other. Comparing magnification by using a long lens to magnification by moving closer, however, the long-focus-lens shot appears to compress the distance between objects due to the perspective from the more distant location. Long lenses thus give a photographer an alternative to the type of perspective distortion exhibited by shorter focal length lenses where (when the photographer stands closer to the given subject) different portions of a subject in a photograph can appear out of proportion to each other.|$|E
5000|$|The {{complexity}} of a lens — {{the number of}} elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view, the maximum aperture, and intended price point, among other variables. An extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations, which are worse {{at the edge of}} the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming. A <b>long-focus</b> <b>lens</b> of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality: a doublet (two elements) will often suffice. Some older cameras were fitted with convertible lenses (German: [...] ) of normal focal length. The front element could be unscrewed, leaving a lens of twice the focal length, and half the angle of view and half the aperture. The simpler half-lens was of adequate quality for the narrow angle of view and small relative aperture. Obviously the bellows had to extend to twice the normal length.|$|E
25|$|While {{the crop}} factor of APS-C cameras {{effectively}} narrows {{the angle of}} view of <b>long-focus</b> (telephoto) <b>lenses,</b> {{making it easier to}} take close-up images of distant objects, wide-angle lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor.|$|R
25|$|Linear {{magnification}} M is {{not always}} the most useful measure of magnifying power. For instance, when characterizing a visual telescope or binoculars that produce only a virtual image, one would be more concerned with the angular magnification—which expresses how much larger a distant object appears through the telescope compared to the naked eye. In the case of a camera one would quote the plate scale, which compares the apparent (angular) size of a distant object {{to the size of the}} real image produced at the focus. The plate scale is the reciprocal of the focal length of the camera lens; lenses are categorized as <b>long-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> or wide-angle lenses according to their focal lengths.|$|R
50|$|The {{front element}} of the Tessar can be {{replaced}} to make a <b>long-focus</b> or wide-angle <b>lens.</b> In 1957 Carl Zeiss offered the long-focus Pro Tessar 115 mm f/4 and 85 mm f/4, and the wide-angle Pro Tessar 35 mm f/3,2 for use on the central-shutter SLR Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B cameras.|$|R
50|$|A {{side effect}} of using lenses of {{different}} focal lengths is the different distances from which a subject can be framed, resulting in a different perspective. Photographs can be taken of a person stretching out a hand with a wideangle, a normal lens, and a telephoto, which contain exactly the same image size by changing {{the distance from the}} subject. But the perspective will be different. With the wideangle, the hands will be exaggeratedly large relative to the head. As the focal length increases, the emphasis on the outstretched hand decreases. However, if pictures are taken from the same distance, and enlarged and cropped to contain the same view, the pictures will have identical perspective. A moderate <b>long-focus</b> (telephoto) <b>lens</b> is often recommended for portraiture because the perspective corresponding to the longer shooting distance is considered to look more flattering.|$|R
50|$|Nikon {{produced}} a 6 mm circular fisheye lens that was initially designed for {{an expedition to}} Antarctica. It featured a 220-degree field of view, designed to capture the entire sky and surrounding ground when pointed straight up. This lens is no longer manufactured by Nikon, and is used nowadays to produce interactive virtual-reality images such as QuickTime VR and IPIX. Because of its very wide field of view, it is very large and cumbersome—weighing 5.2 kg, having a diameter of 236 mm, a length of 171 mm and an angle of view of 220 degrees. It dwarfs a regular 35 mm SLR camera and has its own tripod mounting point, a feature normally seen in large <b>long-focus</b> or telephoto <b>lenses</b> to reduce strain on the lens mount because the lens is heavier than the camera. The lens is extremely rare, however, there a new developments by the Japanese manufacturer Entaniya for the Micro Four Thirds standard, which offer an angle of view of 250 degrees with lenses that have a focal length of 2.3 mm to 3.6 mm, a lens speed of f/2.8 to f/4.0, a weight of 1.6 kg, a diameter of 120 mm and a length below 100 mm.|$|R
