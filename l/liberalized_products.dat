40|$|This paper {{uses the}} opening of the US textile/apparel market for China {{at the end of the}} Multifibre Arrangement in 2005 as a natural {{experiment}} to provide evidence for positive assortative matching of Mexican exporting firms and US importing firms by their capability. We identify three findings for <b>liberalized</b> <b>products</b> by comparing them to other textile/apparel products: (1) US importers switched their Mexican partners to those making greater preshock exports, whereas Mexican exporters switched their US partners to those making fewer preshock imports; (2) for firms who switched partners, trade volume of the old partners and the new partners are positively correlated; (3) small Mexican exporters stop exporting. We develop a model combining Becker-type matching of final producers and suppliers with the standard Melitz-type model to show that these findings are consistent with positive assortative matching but not with negative assortative matching or purely random matching. The model indicates that the findings are evidence for a new mechanism of gain from trade...|$|E

She thanks Raquel Fernandez and the {{participants}} of the Federal Reserve conference for very valuable comments and Hermes Martinez for excellent research assistance. Compared with the pace of structural reforms in Latin America aimed at <b>liberalizing</b> <b>product</b> and capital markets, labor reforms have been scarce. In many instances, when they have occurred, they have increased the level of regulation in labor markets. However, it is often argued that without further labor market reforms aimed at deregulating labor markets, labor market performance will not improve and Latin American economies {{will not be able}} to compete in international markets.

40|$|Vietnamese land-tenure policy {{reforms were}} {{embedded}} into general economic reforms (Doi Moi), enabling the country’s transition toward a market economy. Since 1998, they were implemented incrementally together with complementary instruments such as agricultural market liberalization and new economic incentives. Major steps included disentangling socialist producer cooperatives and assigning land-use rights {{to its former}} members, developing and adapting a national legal framework (Land Law), and enhancing tenure security through gender-balanced inheritable land-use certificates. In addition to promoting individualized rights, successive reforms have contributed to accelerating the agricultural transformation process by encouraging perennial crop and agroforestry systems (and thus long-term leasehold), and allowing rural land rental and land sales markets to re-emerge. During the 1990 s, combined reform efforts sped up agricultural growth and industrialization, thereby enhancing food security, and combating hunger and rural poverty. Individualized rights, <b>liberalized</b> <b>product</b> and input markets, and a new entrepreneurial spirit resulted in intensified irrigated rice production, agricultural diversification, and better food quality. Although reform achievements—accompanied by policy interventions such as export quotas—are tremendous in terms of improved nutritional status and rural livelihoods, more efficient farming and agrarian structures, more secure land investment, access to collateralized credit, and poverty reduction, some challenges to consolidate reforms exist. These challenges include addressing increased urban–rural and regional income disparities, landlessness resulting from emergency land sales, misuse of local elites’ power in land allocation, and endangered “commons” through land privatization.

40|$|Labor {{reforms in}} Latin America have been scarce {{compared}} with the pace of structural reforms aimed at <b>liberalizing</b> <b>product</b> and capital markets. Some analysts contend that without continued liberalization labor market performance will fail to improve, hindering Latin American economies’ ability to compete in international markets.; This article assesses labor market regulations in Latin America, documents their recent history, and assesses their costs and benefits. The author argues that existing regulatory systems, while generating costs in terms of labor market performance, constitute the base (albeit imperfect) of social protection policies in Latin America.; Compared with industrialized countries, Latin American countries have more protective labor regulations governing working conditions and job security but lower social security benefits. Evidence from the existing literature points to sizable negative effects of mandatory benefits, particularly social security contributions, on employment. Job security provisions tend to bias employment toward prime-age workers and away from younger and less skilled workers.; Since the demand for social protection in Latin America appears to be large, the author argues that reforms that seek only labor market deregulation do not address this demand. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} solution lies in designing and implementing less costly social protection mechanisms, but the alternatives are not exempt from costs and are not warranted to improve upon existing systems. In these circumstances, the author recommends a mix of research, policy experimentation, and policy evaluation to find solutions that maximize benefits while minimizing costs.

40|$|With {{the start}} of {{economic}} reforms in 1978, China’s forest sector {{was caught up in}} a whirlwind of change. It began with the devolution of forest tenures in rural areas, but led to reform of state-owned forest enterprises via introduction of stumpage fees and <b>liberalized</b> forest <b>product</b> prices. From the early 1990 s to 1998, while China increasingly embraced the market economy, the nation’s natural forests continued to be depleted despite repeated emphasis on sustainable development. Then, {{in the wake of the}} 1998 floods in the Yangtze River basin, there was a shift in focus from timber production to environmental protection, with policy redirected toward the rehabilitation of damaged forest ecosystems, afforestation in desertified and degraded areas, and a ban on logging in natural forests. We provide an overview of the central themes of reform in China’s forestry sector, identify the major factors that influenced policy formulation, and show that the outcomes of China’s forest policy changes in the aggregate represent a paradigm shift...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} a challenging production-based and market-driven approach {{for the development}} of renewable energy (RE) market. The organized data in our research show that the countries that adopt more RE policies appear to generate more RE products. Among those instruments, incentives/subsidies for production are common and decisive to the popularization of RE products. Recently, the primary RE policy goal for governments is to promote RE products by removing various barriers. However, the energy market should be <b>liberalized</b> as RE <b>products</b> are ubiquitous and able to compete with fossil products. The priority of instruments that governments are supposed to take in order are to remove incentives/subsidies for fossil products, to tax fossil products for the sake of reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, and then, to remove all incentives/subsidies for both fossil and RE products. Furthermore, RE products may have adverse resource and environmental consequences and this dilemma can be averted by taking net energy output as a standard in incentives/subsidies instruments. It was suggested that RE markets are supposed to be classified into three market phases - undeveloped, developing and developed markets. As a promising policy approach, governments have to adopt suitable and flexible instruments to achieve policy goals in different RE market phases.

40|$|Nowadays, due to {{increased}} competition caused by globalization and high rates of innovation supply chains continue to have shorter life-cycle products. More liberal return policies, increasing enforcement of take-back laws, heightened environmental regulations, increase in financial returns, good corporate image, increasing customer demands, have made enterprises face the challenges of strategically managing the returned and discarded products. Therefore, handling of product returns has led the reverse logistics activities to be effective and efficient. Efficiency of reverse logistics is achieved by reducing the waste, recapturing recovered value, reducing inventory investments, and optimizing the collection networks. Reverse logistics effectiveness allows enterprises an opportunity to improve competitiveness by building consumer confidence through handling of returned <b>products,</b> <b>liberalized</b> returns policies, operations of take-back networks, and green aspects of performance. But due to the intrinsic complexities of reverse logistics operations, such as uncertainty in quality, quantity, and timing of returns, makes the product returns process more complicated. The present literature on reverse logistics focuses on the factors that support the enterprises to manage and optimize their operations to remain competitive, but does not reflect upon the comprehensive performance measurement on how enterprises have to measure their reverse logistics activities. To contribute to the field, this research is carried out to study the performance measurement in reverse logistics enterprise {{to fill the gap}} in the literature. This dissertation presents a CRLEPMS - Comprehensive Reverse Logistics Enterprise Performance Measurement methodology to facilitate performance measurement and decision making for the enterprise involved in reverse logistics. It examines different performance measurement attributes and criteria for measuring reverse logistics performance. It investigates the inner and inter relationships among different criteria of attributes and also among clusters of attributes applying DEMATEL, FANP and AHP MCDM methods. Further, the enterprise computes the comprehensive overall performance index in order to benchmark its performance with best in class practices. The application of the CRLEPMS methodology provides the enterprises with a real world viewpoint of what and how performance attributes and measures impact the comprehensive overall performance index, so that they get feedback and continuously improve their product returns practices...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the US {{has worked to}} persuade Japan to open its wood {{products}} market to US products through various channels including bilateral talks, multilateral negotiations, and regional alliances. In response, Japan has reluctantly liberalized and deregulated its wood products imports through tariff reductions, building standards revisions, and foreign product standards recognition over the last fifteen years. Although the US-Japan trade dispute has been a widely discussed topic in general, the dispute over trade liberalization and market deregulation of the wood products sector has been often neglected or seldom mentioned. At a time when discussions of new multilateral trade talks are beginning within the WTO, and Japan is reevaluating its stance toward <b>liberalized</b> wood <b>products</b> imports by initiating a preliminary investigation to the possible implementation of a safeguard action against softwood lumber imports, it will be useful {{to look back and}} understand the process through which the US-Japan wood products trade dispute has progressed, the outcomes it has achieved, and the lessons that can be drawn from this experience. The objectives of this study are 1) to describe the historical development of the US-Japan wood products trade dispute, 2) to summarize the trade liberalization and market deregulation measures taken in Japan {{as a result of these}} trade negotiations, 3) to analyze the performance of US products in Japan’s mix of wood products imports, and 4) to conduct a preliminary evaluation of US trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives on Japan’s wood products market. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE US-JAPAN WOOD PRODUCTS TRADE DISPUTE The US-Japan wood products trade dispute began in the early 1980 s under the conditions of a growing US trade deficit with Japan, the economic recession in the US, and the relative decline of the wood products industry in the western US. In 1985, Japan’s wood products sector was chosen as a target for the MOSS talks, mainly due to Japan’s strong opposition to the reduction of tariffs on veneer and plywood. Both countries reached an agreement to reduce specific wood product tariffs and to modify product standards so as to meet the requests of the US. In spite of the trade policy changes achieved in 1985, US legislators remained dissatisfied with the growing trade deficit with Japan and legislated the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, including the Super 301 provision. Due to US industry frustration with Japan’s reluctance toward continuing the MOSS process, Japan’s wood products sector was identified as a “priority practice” under the Super 301 provision in 1989. Under the threat of retaliation, both countries concluded the “ 1990 Agreement on Wood Products. ” Although the Agreement did not deal with tariff issues directly, it required an overhaul of Japan’s building standards and products standards. After the completion of Super 301 negotiations, the US wood products industry turned to a new trade issue: the zero-for-zero initiative in the GATT Uruguay Round, by forming the Zero Tariff Coalition in cooperation with other industrial sectors. Although several industrial sectors achieved mutual tariff elimination during the Uruguay Round, the wood products sector failed to achieve tariff elimination primarily due to Japan’s opposition. Following the end of the GATT negotiations in December 1993, the US continued its pressure on Japan to eliminate tariffs on wood products. Due to Japan’s resistance, coupled with the failure of the Framework talks in February 1994, the US revived the Super 301 provision to name Japan’s wood products sector in the watch list, forcing Japan to compromise. With Japan’s promise to fully implement the 1990 Agreement and new initiatives in Japan’s housing sector that was partly stimulated by the Kobe Earthquake disaster, the US industry finally allowed the removal of Japan from the Super 301 watch list in 1996. Although the tariff elimination issue was also discussed during the bilateral negotiations following the Super 301 revival, it was eventually transferred to the regional discussions held within APEC. While the elimination of wood products tariffs was successfully included in the EVSL initiative, Japan refused to participate in the wood products tariff measure citing the APEC principle of voluntarism. Finally, APEC members agreed to move the renamed ATL initiative to the WTO, hoping to reach agreement during the Third WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle. However, no progress was made on the ATL initiative, or on the initiation of the WTO New Round. RESULTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND MARKET DEREGULATION The US industry succeeded in the trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives in Japan’s wood products sector. As the result of fifteen years of negotiations, Japan reduced tariffs on wood products, changed its building standards from prescriptive to performance-based, and recognized wood products graded in the US for construction use in Japan. First, regarding tariffs, the MOSS agreement reduced tariffs on specific products including veneer and plywood, and the Uruguay Round Agreement reduced tariffs on most wood products by approximately 30 % from the applied level in 1993. The final bound rates were implemented in 1999 following a five-year staging period. However, due to shifts in Japan’s wood products imports from logs to processed products, the trade-weighted average of wood products tariffs increased slightly during the 1985 - 1999 period. Second, in 1999, Japan revised its Building Standard Law from a prescriptive to a performance-based system, as promised in the 1990 Agreement on Wood Products and the 1996 Emergency Priority Program. Additionally, Japan immediately implemented specific building standard measures listed in the ANNEX of the 1990 Agreement. It is expected that the revised BSL will increase the number of 2 x 4 wood frame housing starts and promote the use of imported value-added wood products for post and beam homes. Third, Japan introduced new systems, which recognized imported wood products for construction use in Japan. Regarding JAS, MAFF implemented the FTO system, which permitted the use of test data conducted by recognized foreign testing organizations for the mill certification and product testing process as a result of the MOSS agreement. Later, in 1999, MAFF revised the JAS Law to incorporate the RCO/RFCO system which authorized specific (foreign) certification organizations to certify (foreign) manufacturers to test their own products and self-label them as JAS approved. At the same time, MOC reached a mutual recognition agreement with the US industry which recognized the use of dimension lumber, MSR lumber, and finger-jointed lumber bearing the grademark of US testing agencies for 2 x 4 wood frame construction in Japan. These measures will surely provide easier access for foreign products, not limited to just US products, in Japan’s wood products market. EFFECTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND MARKET DEREGULATION In spite of its success in the trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives, the US wood products industry has been losing market share in Japan’s imports of softwood lumber, softwood plywood, softwood veneer, structural laminated lumber, wood doors, and wood windows. In some cases, the US increased its exports to Japan, but exports from other countries, mostly Canada and EU, increased more rapidly than those from the US, resulting in a lower market share for the US. This trend indicates that as the US industry was negotiating trade liberalization and market deregulation initiatives in Japan, structural changes were occurring that would adversely impact the competitiveness of the US wood products industry. These structural and market changes include changing material preferences in Japan toward kiln-dried products, the strength of the US dollar relative to Canadian and European currencies, and higher transportation costs from the US to Japan than from the EU. In addition, it should be noted that some studies indicated that other successful countries made substantial efforts to develop a better understanding of Japanese market conditions and accommodate Japanese customers’ extra requirement for products and services. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION The declining share of US products in Japan’s wood products imports can be attributed to two factors: an increase in US domestic consumption of wood products, and the reduced international competitiveness of US wood products. First, wood products exports have become less important to the US industry with the increasing consumption of wood products under the strong economic growth of the 1990 s. Second, the US industry has been slow to develop its advantage relative to its competitors in Japan, where some market conditions, including a shift in material preferences toward kiln-dried products, less favorable changing exchange rates, and highertransportation costs, have adversely impacted the competitiveness of US wood products. If the US industry wants to increase its wood products exports, it would be advisable for the industry to develop its advantages relative to its competitors in addition to improving market access. Important factors for success include developing a better understanding of the market, making stronger efforts to match product offerings with changing customer preferences, accommodating customers’ extra requirements for products and services, improving product quality, and offering competitive prices. Additionally, the US industry may wish to reconsider their export strategies in response to increasing domestic consumption and constrained resource availability and the impact of these factors on their ability to commit to long-term relationships with their foreign customers. At this time, it is too early to reach a final conclusion regarding the competitiveness of the US wood products industry. Given Japan’s changing market conditions, new opportunities could emerge for the US wood products industry to further penetrate Japan’s import market. In that case, future success is dependent upon the US industry’s efforts to develop its advantages relative to their competitors...|$|R
