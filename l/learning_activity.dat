2500|$|Connected {{learning}} {{is a type of}} learning that integrates personal interest, peer relationships, and achievement in academic, civic, or career-relevant areas. In addition, connected {{learning is}} an approach to educational reform keyed to the abundance of information and social connection brought about by networked and digital media. Advocates of connected learning posit that this approach leverages new media to broaden access to opportunity and meaningful learning experiences. The connected learning model suggests that youth learn best when: they are interested in what they are learning; they have peers and mentors who share these interests; and their learning is directed toward opportunity and recognition. According to the proponents of connected learning, social support for interest-driven learning and connections to multiple sites of <b>learning</b> <b>activity</b> drive individual learning outcomes. These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities. [...] Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.|$|E

This research method was quasi – experimental using the factorial design 3 x 3. The Population of this research was all students in the tenth grade of High School / MA in Karanganyar in the academic year of 2013 / 2014. The Sampling was done by stratified cluster random sampling. The total samples in this research were 340 students (113 students for TSTS class, 113 students for LC 5 E class and 114 students for direct learning model). The proposed hypothesis of the research were tested by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The conclusions of this research were as follow: (1) cooperative learning model TSTS, LC 5 E and direct learning model have the same achievement in trigonometry.

This study involved about 148 of front line Customs officers from Passengers Unit at south entry point of Royal Malaysian Customs, Johor Bahru at CIQ Bangunan Sultan Iskandar and CIQ Sultan Abu Bakar Complex, Tanjung Kupang, as respondents. The data for this study was collected by using questionnaires built by Lohman (2006) for informal <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> and Job Descriptive Index (JDI) by Smith, Kendall & Hulin (1969) for job satisfaction. The data have been analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 17. 0 and the quantitative methodology was introduced in this study.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to examine the impact {{transformational}} leadership, teamwork, and self-efficacy, have on teacher learning in VET colleges. The conceptual model of the study that summarizes the various paths via which teachers’ engagement in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> can be influenced was already presented in Figure  1. Based on previous studies, we hypothesize that self-efficacy positively affects teachers’ engagement in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> (hypothesis 1). With regard to the impact teamwork processes may have on teacher engagement in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities,</b> we hypothesize that perceived task and goal interdependence will affect teachers’ engagement in <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> positively (hypothesis 2) and that the effect of perceived task and goal interdependence on teachers’ engagement in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> will be mediated by teachers’ sense of self-efficacy (hypothesis 3). Regarding the impact of transformational leadership practices (e.g., vision building, individualized support and intellectual stimulation) on teacher engagement in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities,</b> we expect that transformational leadership indirectly fosters the engagement of teachers in professional <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> with perceived goal and task interdependence mediating the effects (hypothesis 4).|$|R

The first phase uses a synthesis of <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> of master teachers of sciences and mathematics broadcast on public television in Thailand.

The second phase features interviews with five teachers who have implemented <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> from master teachers’ broadcasts on TV in their teaching. The research instruments are observation records of <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> by master teachers via TV and interview records. Data analysis is carried out using descriptive statistics and cross tabulation. It was found that the <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> of the majority of master teachers (93 %) that promote students’ interest involve the use of learning sources around schools, nature and items used in everyday life and integration of <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> at each step (leading, teaching and concluding). Examples of activities are giving examples, playing games, experiments, posing questions that make students think, demonstration and practicing.

Objectives The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between nurses' motives and activities for continuing professional development, by examining in which types of <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> nurses engage, with which motives, and whether certain motives are associated with certain <b>learning</b> <b>activities.</b> Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Settings and Participants Twenty-one nurses in academic and general Dutch hospitals participated. Methods Interview data on nurses' learning biographies were analysed using a literature-based framework on motives and <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> for continuing professional development. As recent classifications of nurses' motives for professional development were absent, the literature was reviewed for motives, using three databases. The interview transcripts were analysed for motives, <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> and their relationships. Results Nine motives and four categories of <b>learning</b> <b>activities</b> for continuing professional development were delineated. Increasing competence was the primary motive that stimulated nurses to engage in self-directed learning during work, and in formal <b>learning</b> <b>activities.</b> To comply with requirements, they engaged in mandatory courses. To deepen knowledge, they registered for conferences. To develop their careers, they enrolled in postgraduate education. Five other motives were not mentioned as frequently. Conclusions Specific motives were found to be related to engagement in particular <b>learning</b> <b>activities.</b> Nurses could use these findings to increase their awareness of why and how they develop professionally, and managers and human resource development professionals could develop approaches that would better suit nurses' needs.
