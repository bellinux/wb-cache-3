5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its <b>listed</b> <b>price</b> on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E

40|$|Houses are {{routinely}} sold at prices below, but rarely sold at <b>prices</b> above, their <b>list</b> <b>price.</b> <b>List</b> <b>prices</b> {{appear to be}} price ceilings that preclude the possibility of sales at higher prices. This paper presents a theory of sellers' behavior that explains why there are <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> in housing markets and why <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> are distinct from sellers' reservation prices. The theory forms {{the basis of an}} econometric model that has been estimated using data from the Baltimore, Maryland, area. The estimated model predicts sale and reservation <b>prices</b> conditional on <b>list</b> <b>prices.</b> The predictions of sale prices are considerably more accurate than those obtained from a standard hedonic price regression. The estimated model also explains why sellers may not be willing to reduce their <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> even after their houses have remained unsold for long periods of time.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the use (and non-use) of <b>list</b> <b>price</b> {{information in the}} process of marketing commercial real estate. As far as we are aware, this has not been addressed in the literature. While housing market research suggests that <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> can serve as a strong anchor and/or signal, <b>list</b> <b>price</b> information is included in less than one-third of the commercial property sales and is less likely to be included as part of the sellers’ offering information for larger multi-tenant properties. Given the potentially powerful effect of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> (first offers) on outcomes, the non-use of <b>list</b> <b>price</b> information is a puzzle. We speculate that the limited use of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> {{may be due to the}} sellers’ interests in both maintaining their informational advantage and not truncating higher than expected offers, especially during periods of economic growth or with more complex properties. Using a two-stage selection correction model, we find that office properties which provide <b>list</b> <b>price</b> information are, on average, associated with lower price outcomes (ceteris paribus) and that these outcomes vary by price cohort and economic condition. It is important to note, however, that while these findings identify a correlation, they do not necessarily imply causation (i. e., that the use of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> ‘cause’ transaction prices to be lower). Our results support the notion that asymmetric information and signaling (i. e., the conveyance of property and/or seller information that may affect the likelihood of sale) play a dominant role in explaining the sellers’ strategic non-use of <b>list</b> <b>price</b> information in the commercial property market...|$|R

2500|$|By {{using the}} StubHub website, a buyer may select from {{available}} tickets to an event. StubHub charges buyers {{a fee of}} 10% {{of the purchase price}} of the tickets (minimum $5 per transaction). [...] A shipping and handling charge is then imposed (minimum $4.95) and tickets are either shipped via UPS, email delivered, available for instant download, or picked up the day of the event at a last-minute services office. In total, on a typical order, StubHub earns 20-25% of the purchase price of every ticket sold: buyers typically pay 10% more than the <b>listed</b> <b>price</b> and sellers receive 10-15% less than their <b>listed</b> <b>price</b> depending on certain seller metrics and bonuses. Criteria for reduced seller fees include confirm time, fill rate, and quarterly sales totals. [...] Additional seller incentives include the ability to buy tickets without paying service fees. If a buyer fails to win the ticket, StubHub will help the buyer find alternative tickets. [...] StubHub does not prohibit sellers from listing tickets for any amount, regardless of how absurd the amount might be, but posts the prices at which tickets have sold. [...] A September 2012 Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays game had tickets listed for $52,122, nearly 1000 times the face value of the tickets. Ticket prices for the 2009 Super Bowl averaged $2,500.

50|$|Typically, {{the real}} estate agent has the {{experience}} and data to determine a suitable <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> for the seller's property and will recommend a <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> to the seller.

40|$|Many {{goods are}} marketed after first stating a <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> with the {{expectation}} that the eventual sales price will differ. In this article, we first present a simple model of search behavior that includes the seller setting a <b>list</b> <b>price.</b> Holding constant the mean of the buyers’ distribution of potential offers for a good, we assume that the greater the <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> the slower the arrival rate of offers but the greater is the maximal offer. This trade-off determines the optimal <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> which is set simultaneously with the seller's reservation price. Comparative statics are derived through a set of numerical sensitivity tests, where we show that the greater the variance of the distribution of buyers’ potential offers, the greater is the ratio of the <b>list</b> <b>price</b> to expected sales price. Thus, sellers of atypical goods will tend to set a relatively high <b>list</b> <b>price</b> compared with standard goods. We test this hypothesis using data from the Columbus, Ohio, housing market and find substantial support. We also find empirical support for another hypothesis of the model: atypical dwellings take longer to sell. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose In Italy {{selling prices}} are not public {{information}} and therefore <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> {{play a key}} role for market analyses and are used by real estate companies and appraisers for estimating house values. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the listing behaviours of agents and sellers. In particular, the paper analyzes <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and the predicting power of the house features described in advertisements, to improve their use in real estate valuations. Design/methodology/approach We employed a traditional hedonic model to measure the overall contribution to <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. We performed the analysis both on houses put on the market by agents and on houses put on the market by sellers. We analyzed <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> distributions and their deviation from normality. Furthermore, we performed the hedonic analysis, which consisted in two steps. Firstly, the coefficient of determination for any characteristic was computed. Secondly, we measured the overall contribution to the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. Findings The analysis shows the presence of factors which affect <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and which are not revealed to buyers in real estate advertisements. On the other hand, we also found the presence of characteristics that do not affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> but are described in advertisements. Furthermore, agents and sellers showed different behaviours. While the marginal contributions of each characteristic estimated on a sample of houses put on the market by agents were significant, our analysis reveals that <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses put on the market by sellers themselves are not explained by the house features. Originality/value To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a hedonic approach to exploring the major determinants of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses on sale on the Italian market. The listing behaviour of agents and sellers and the predicting power of the observable characteristics could address the use of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> in real estate valuations. At the same time, the potential presence of unobservable factors that affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> could be a source of bias in estimating the value of houses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{examines}} the usefulness of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> as leading indicators of house values and as predictors of the direction of housing markets. With Multiple Listing Service data from a large metropolitan area, we create two price indexes, using first <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> and then selling price {{as the dependent variable}} in the hedonic regressions. The market is then geographically and categorically segmented, and Granger causality tests are performed to analyze the leading aspect of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> in the <b>list</b> price-sales <b>price</b> relationship. We find that different segments of the market perform quite differently over the time period of our study, suggesting that for data-based appraisal purposes care is needed in determining the manner and level of aggregation. We also find, however, that market <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> continue to convey important information about subsequent selling prices in most market segments...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the {{emergence}} of online penny or pay-to-bid auctions, in this study, we analyze the operational consequences of all-pay auctions competing with fixed <b>list</b> <b>price</b> stores. In all-pay auctions, bidders place bids, and highest bidder wins. Depending on the auction format, the winner pays either the amount of their bid or that of the second-highest bid. All losing bidders forfeit their bids, regardless of the auction format. Bidders may visit the store, both before and after bidding, and buy the item at the fixed <b>list</b> <b>price.</b> In a modified version, we consider a setting where bidders can use their sunk bid as a credit towards buying the item from the auctioneer at a fixed price (different from the <b>list</b> <b>price).</b> We characterize a symmetric equilibrium in the bidding/buying strategy and derive optimal <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> for both the seller and auctioneer to maximize expected revenue.

40|$|<b>List,</b> or retail, <b>pricing</b> is {{a widely}} used trading {{institution}} where firms announce a price that may be discounted at a later stage.

Both firms first simultaneously choose a maximum <b>list</b> <b>price</b> and then decide whether to discount, or not, in a subsequent stage. We show that <b>list</b> <b>pricing</b> works as a credible commitment device that induces a pure strategy outcome. This is true for a general class of rationing rules.
