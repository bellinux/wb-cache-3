5000|$|Thailand was {{the last}} plant to start {{assembling}} Ford Fiesta for ASEAN countries. A 6-speed Powershift dual-clutch transmission was made available as standard transmission initially for the 1.6L Ti-VCT engines in 2011 and 2012 in Thailand, and currently also for the 1.5 Ti-VCT variant (officially from March 2012 onwards). Curiously, the Thai-made Fiesta versions - both saloon and five-door hatch - feature a 100 mm pitch circle diameter (PCD) wheel <b>lug</b> <b>mount</b> measurement identical to the Mazda2, {{as opposed to the}} 108 mm one as found in other global versions. There were 3 models at launch; 1.4 [...] "Style", 1.6 [...] "Trend" [...] and 1.6 [...] "Sport". All models feature ABS, driver airbag, air conditioning, electric windows and mirrors; the top-of-the-range 1.6 Ti-VCT 'Sport' and (from 2013) 1.5 Ti-VCT 'Sport' models featuring front passenger airbag, alloy wheels and stability control across the range, along with voice command in-car entertainment system and Bluetooth connectivity. Some of the paint options available for the Fiesta in Thailand (such as 'True Red' (a colour shared with the new Ford Ranger Pick-up)) are also shared with the Mazda2 (known as 'Race Red').|$|E
50|$|The Dror was {{air-cooled}} and recoil-operated. The barrel uses a rotary bolt {{with multiple}} radial <b>lugs</b> <b>mounted.</b> The Drors is fired from an open-bolt in full auto for better cooling {{or from a}} closed-bolt in semi-auto for better accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Centerline <b>lug</b> <b>mounts</b> —Absorb {{forces on}} the centerline, and require dowel pins to secure the lugs to prevent {{movement}} at higher pressures or under shock conditions. Dowel pins hold it to the machine when operating at high pressure or under shock loading.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2010, the Q and QR {{series are}} no longer made, having been {{replaced}} by the new Voyager series, while Horizon series has replaced the VX series (VXB for Britain). These entry-level, yet highly regarded kits have improved their <b>lugs,</b> <b>mounts,</b> badges and bass drum claws. The Horizon HZ kit offers a newly mixed birch/basswood drum shell. A newly available Mapex cymbal pack is optional with any of these kits.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle’s chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated {{to retain}} {{accuracy}} after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel {{also features a}} flash suppressor with an angled cut at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet <b>lug</b> <b>mounted</b> near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: [...] "normal" [...] for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and [...] "adverse"—used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low pressure ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The MBV-78-A2 {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} Vietnamese anti-personnel fragmentation stake mine. It is {{unrelated to}} the MBV-78-A1. The mine has a large plastic head which contains the main charge wrapped around the detonator. A fragmentation layer of steel pieces set into wax surrounds the main charge. The plastic head has two <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> for stake <b>mounting</b> the mine. A Vietnamese copy of the Russian MUV fuze is typically used with the mine, although other fuzes could be used.|$|R
25|$|A few older {{machines}} {{have moved}} their bobbin winders {{to the high}} position, but they will still have a <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> {{for it in the}} original lower position.|$|R
5000|$|The carbine (official {{designation}} link=no; [...] "Cavalry Repeating-Carbine M1895") was chambered 8×50mmR Mannlicher {{and used}} by cavalry units of the Austro-Hungarian Army as a replacement of the Mannlicher M1890 carbine. The sights were graduated 500-2400 paces (375-1800 m). Although it originally didn't have bayonet lugs, during World War I it was fitted with stutzen-like front barrel band with bayonet <b>lugs</b> after <b>mounted</b> cavalry units were found ineffective.|$|R
50|$|The camera {{introduced}} a new three <b>lug</b> bayonet <b>mount.</b> This mount remains substantially unchanged to the present day, although the mount has been developed {{in order to accommodate}} increased levels of automation. Leica had always offered a more limited range of reflex lenses than its Japanese rivals; {{at the time of the}} introduction of the Leicaflex, the range was limited to 35mm, 50mm, 90mm and 135mm focal lengths of moderate speed.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated motor <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs,</b> {{cast into}} {{the rear of the}} pillar, {{standardize}} the position of the motor bracket. A decade later, motor designs will settle down into a side-mounted motor that attaches to these lugs using an L-shaped bracket.|$|R
5000|$|... First one ply, steam bent snare drum of {{the modern}} era * First hybrid (more than one type of wood in a ply shell) drum set {{of the modern}} era * Introduced nodal point <b>lug</b> <b>mounting,</b> a {{technique}} of <b>mounting</b> drum <b>lugs</b> at the point on the shell where it vibrates the least, allowing the drum to resonate * Symmetrical Venting - a technique of creating vent hole to allow maximum tone in each drum * Sharp bearing edges - 45 degree angle narrow cut, minimizing drum head contact for mazimum sustain * Staggered ply construction - choosing ply numbers and thickness to optimize tone independently and in between drums * Suspension mounting - a technique of isolating each shell {{from the rest of}} the kit even while mounted, maximizing sustain * Cool Mounts - a tom mount system providing quick and easy set-up and breakdown, also allowing for quick change-out of drums in the recording studio * Hand Painted finishes - While this technique is not unique to Noble & Cooley, all of the company's drums are finished by hand, whether rubbed oil, stain or paint.|$|R
50|$|Normally stored {{below ground}} the drum was mounted {{at the start}} of {{exercises}} or at Transition To War on a special above ground mount set in the concrete of the entrance hatch. Concentric <b>lugs</b> on the <b>mount</b> ensured that the drum was mounted correctly even in the dark.|$|R
5000|$|Some handguns used to {{come from}} the factory with <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> for a {{shoulder}} stock, notably including the [...] "Broomhandle" [...] Mauser C96, Luger P.08, and Browning Hi-Power. In the case of the first two, the pistol could come with a hollow wooden stock that doubled as a holster.|$|R
50|$|It was {{excavated}} in 1924 by the University of Michigan team. The gate had inscriptions on both sides. These were {{mounted on}} architraves and were formed from individually cast bronze letters which had <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on their reverses. These lugs were fixed with lead into holes {{cut in the}} stone.|$|R
50|$|The 'old' version {{consists}} of a cylindrical main body with six large fragmentation grooves running around the circumference and two <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on one side for mounting the mine to a provided metal stake. The 'new' version of the mine is similar, but with a smaller fuze and no fragmentation grooves.|$|R
40|$|A failed Tail Gear Box (TGB) housing of a {{helicopter}} was analyzed. Analysis showed that the gearbox failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks initiated at the <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> and propagated by low cycle fatigue. There were no metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities associated with fatigue crack initiation. Fatigue appears to be stress related. The possibility of excessive load/vibration on the TGB housings in question may be examined...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley 8 -foot transonic tunnels on the aerodynamic characteristics of a 0. 15 -scale model of the North American Aviation 255 -inch fin-stabilized external store over a maximum Mach number range of 0. 60 to 1. 2 and on the effects of <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs,</b> of fin orientation, of fin aspect ratio, and of fixed-transition. The Reynolds number (based on a body length of 37. 50 inches) varied from 9. 8 x 10 (exp 6) to 13. 1 x 10 (exp 6). The results indicate that the static margin of the finned store at low lift coefficients was only 9 percent of body length at subsonic Mach numbers and was reduced to zero at a Mach number of 1. 0, Increasing the fin aspect ratio from 1. 82 to 2. 41 increased the subsonic static margin to 18 percent and provided a minimum margin of 9 percent near a Mach number of l. O. Store <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> or fin orientation had only small effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the basic store...|$|R
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein the pilot {{heard a loud}} bang on accelerating throttle to max dry rpm at line up. After preliminary examination, a few suspected components of the damaged engine were forwarded to the laboratory for identification of mode and cause of failure. Examination revealed that failure {{of one of the}} first stage low-pressure compressor blades was the first in the chain of events that led to the engine failure. Fractographic examination showed that the compressor blade had failed by fatigue. The fatigue crack had initiated at the fillet of the blade <b>mounting</b> <b>lug.</b> Fatigue cracks were found present at the fillet of all four <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> of this blade. Similar cracks were also noticed in two more blades adjacent to the fractured blade. It was established that the stress raisers arising due to absence of fillet radius was the primary reason for the fatigue crack initiation. The blade material and the microstructure were found to conform to specification. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R
5000|$|During the Mexican-American War the U.S. {{found itself}} lacking in light guns {{that could be}} fired from ships’ boats and landed {{to be used as}} light {{artillery}} in support of landing parties [...] Light artillery borrowed from the army proved unsatisfactory. In 1849, then lieutenant, Dahlgren began to design a family of smoothbore muzzle-loading boat howitzers that could be mounted in ships’ launches and cutters as well as being mounted onto field carriages. The first boat howitzers to be designed were a light 12-pounder, a heavy 12-pounder (originally designated a medium), and a 24-pounder. Later a lighter 12-pounder (the small) and a rifled 12-pounder heavy howitzer were introduced. All of the boat howitzers were very similar in design, cast in bronze, with a <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> or loop {{on the bottom of the}} barrel instead of trunnions, and an elevating screw running through the cascabel. Having the single <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> expedited moving the howitzer from the launch to field carriage and back. In naval service the boat howitzers had gun crews of 10 in the boat and 11 ashore.|$|R
50|$|The Model 605A CAR-15 Carbine was a {{shortened}} {{version for}} situations where longer weapons could be unwieldy, such as aboard vehicles or helicopters. The only significant {{change from the}} M16 rifle was that the barrel was shortened to 15 in in length, so that it ended just forward of the front sight base. Because of the shorter barrel, no bayonet <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> were provided. One prototype used a shorter handguard and a 16 in long barrel.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} MGB {{housing and}} a cracked TGB housing {{belonging to a}} helicopter were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the causes of failures. The components were made of Mg-alloy of RZ- 5 specification. Investigation revealed that both the components have failed by fatigue. The fatigue crack initiation in the <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> of the MGB housing was stress related. It is believed that the component has experienced unexpected high loads at these mounting locations, probably due to some abnormalities in the gearbox. However, {{this needs to be}} ascertained by detailed examination of the gearbox components. The fatigue crack initiation in the TGB housing was due to high stress concentration arising from a thin edge at the fillet region. The fatigue crack initiation was also facilitated because of wide difference in the length of the webs of the <b>mounting</b> <b>lug,</b> which was caused due to incorporation of a temperature sensor-locating boss at this location. It is recommended that the design aspects of the lug be reviewed for a possible relocation of the temperature sensor-locating boss to a non-critical region or isolation of the boss from the attachment lug. ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{variant of}} the SPW {{requested}} by the US Special Operations Forces is the Mk 46 Mod 0 that incorporates a lightweight fluted barrel but lacks the magazine feed system, vehicle <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> and carry handle. A railed forearm ensures modularity and mission-adaptability permitting the use of flashlights, vertical grips, and infrared laser designators. An improved variant known as the Mk 46 Mod 1 with an improved forward rail and lightweight titanium bipod has been adopted by the United States Navy.|$|R
50|$|Pole-mounted {{transformers}} {{often include}} accessories such as surge arresters or protective fuse links. A self-protected transformer includes an internal fuse and surge arrester; other transformers have these components mounted separately outside the tank. Pole-mounted transformers may have <b>lugs</b> allowing direct <b>mounting</b> to a pole, {{or may be}} mounted on crossarms bolted to the pole. Aerial transformers, larger than around 75 kVA, may be mounted on a platform supported {{by one or more}} poles. A three-phase service may use three identical transformers, one per phase.|$|R
40|$|The <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> of the MGB housing of a {{helicopter}} has failed by fatigue. With the available evidences, {{it was not possible}} to establish the exact cause of the failure. Analysis shows that the fatigue crack initiation was due to one or more of the following reasons: (a) ovality in the lug bore and/or bush, (b) excessive rotational torque on the MGB housing, and (c) improper fitment. No metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the failure. The microstructure and chemical composition of the housing material were found to conform to RZ- 5 specification...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{prototype of}} Haenels design, the MKb 42(H), fired {{from an open}} bolt and used a striker for firing. The receiver and trigger housing with pistol grip were made from steel stampings, which were attached to the barrel assembly on a hinge, allowing the weapon to be folded open for quick disassembly and cleaning. The Haenel design proved superior to Walthers MKb 42(W), and the army then asked Haenel for another version incorporating a list of minor changes designated MKb 42(H). One was to include <b>lugs</b> for <b>mounting</b> a standard bayonet, another to change the pitch of the rifling. A production run of these modified versions {{was sent to the}} field in November 1942, and the users appreciated it with a few reservations. Another set of modifications added a hinged cover over the ejection port to keep it clean in combat, and rails to mount a telescopic sight. A run of these modified MKb 42(H)s in late 1942 and early 1943 produced 11,833 guns.|$|R
5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the same length.|$|R

50|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} drilled and tapped. Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid handwheel instead of the larger heavier spoked handwheel used on machines sold as treadles. The spoked handwheel is better for treadles because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid handwheel is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|R

40|$|A sample {{pertaining}} to the <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> of ‘A’ frame at cluster 8 D of body structure of accident helicopter {{was sent to the}} laboratory for fractographic analysis. It was requested not to carry out any destructive tests on the sample. Fractographic analysis suggests that the lug in question has failed by sudden overload. There were no evidences of delayed failure like stress corrosion cracking or fatigue. The weld quality at the failed lug was found to be poor. Insufficient fusion and lack of weld penetration were observed. However, these imperfections do not appear to have any role to play in the present failure...|$|R
40|$|The TGB housing had a 14 mm long {{fatigue crack}} at the fillet of the lug fusing area {{of one of}} the <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs.</b> Examination {{revealed}} that the fatigue crack initiation was due to presence of a mechanical stress raiser at the fillet.

50|$|Mounting the {{indicator}} may be done several ways. Many indicators have a <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> {{with a hole}} for a bolt {{as part of the}} back plate. Alternately, the device can be held by the cylindrical stem that guides the plunger using a collet or special clamp, which is the method generally used by tools designed to integrate an indicator as a primary component, such as thickness gauges and comparators. Common outside diameters for the stem are 3/8 inch and 8 mm, though there are other diameters made. Another option that a few manufacturers include is dovetail mounts compatible with those on dial test indicators.|$|R
50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston floating caliper for the 35 mm forks. The brake caliper <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|R
