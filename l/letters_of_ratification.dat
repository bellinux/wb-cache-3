40|$|The paper {{examines}} the process <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in {{the member states}} of the European Union, from the date of its signature in Rome on 29 October 2004 to the European Council of June 2006 which decided to prolong the 'period of reflection' for two further years. It first analyses the constitutional constraints which have to be observed in the member states, distinguishing between ratification according to ordinary legislative procedure and according to a special procedure, the possibility to chose between a parliamentary authorisation or a referendum, the possibility of judicial review of the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and {{the powers of the}} Head of State. It then examines more deeply the different procedures followed for the authorisation <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> the referenda which took place or were foreseen and the delays in ratification, as well as the decisions of constitutional courts and the constitutional amendments adopted in view <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution for Europe. The paper concludes with an appraisal of the so-called 'period of reflection' and the reactions in member states...|$|R

40|$|The Pacific {{region has}} the lowest {{regional}} rate <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> international human rights treaties in the world. There is currently considerable pressure on Pacific Island states from various quarters to ratify the core human rights treaties. Intuitively, <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> human rights treaties should support more effective governance, and therefore contribute to security {{and stability in the}} Pacific. Will it? This paper explores whether ratifying human rights treaties is a useful way to advance the cause of human rights in the Pacific. Part I of the paper takes a current “snapshot” <b>of</b> the <b>ratification</b> project in the Pacific by setting out the current levels <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> looking at the reasons for low ratification, and noting the recent calls for greater ratification. Part II sets out the key consequences for states of ratifying international human rights treaties, and then looks at the benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> In light <b>of</b> this context, Part III considers strategies Pacific states might adopt in responding to the call for ratification...|$|R

50|$|In a state's legislature, the {{ratification}} method is procedurally simple - merely propose a resolution, memorial, or proclamation <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and vote {{it up or}} down in each chamber of that state legislature. But using the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> {{is a bit more}} complicated because it is, by necessity, separate and different from a state legislature. As early as the 1930s, state lawmakers enacted laws to prepare for the possibility of Congress specifying the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> Many laws refer to a one-off event, with an ad-hoc convention convened solely {{for the purposes of the}} 21st amendment. Other laws, however, provided guidelines for ratifying conventions in general.|$|R

Hungary was the first member state where the treaty was approved by a national parliament on 17 December 2007. Note that the assent {{of the head of}} state represents the approval of the parliamentary procedure, while the deposition of the instrument <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> refers to the last step <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> which might require a separate signature of the head of state on the instrument <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> for it to be deposited. For the discussion of the specific legal situation in countries which have encountered obstacles in the ratification process, see relevant section below the table.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of my work}} is to {{determine}} which factors {{were the most important}} in process <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> Treaty of Lisbon in Czech Republic and in Slovakia. The lenght and the complexity <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> were quite different in both countries. My work is based on concept saying that foreign policy of Czech Republic and Slovakia was given by domestic and foreign policy factors. 1 In Slovakia it was mainly the determination to change suverenistic foreign policy of former prime ministr Vladimír Mečiar. On the other hand in Czech Republic politics were convinced that Czech Republic belongs to Europe and so they can dare to criticize EU's decisions. After analysis of stances of all important political parties in both countries, I can conclude, that concept I am using, is applicable also to the process <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> and therefore it was also the main reasons of different lenght and complexity <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> 1 Petr Drulák, Michal Kořan a Jan Růžička, "Außenpolitik in Ostmitteleuropa", Osteuropa 58 (červenec 2008) : 139 - 152...|$|R
