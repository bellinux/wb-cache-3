Some of the most attractive characteristics of LiMnSiO are that it possesses the high theoretical capacity of 333 mA h g and {{is much easier to}} achieve the transformation of Mn/Mn and Mn/Mn within the voltage range of the electrolyte system currently used in Li-ion batteries compared with the other <b>lithium</b> transition metal <b>orthosilicates.</b> However, LiMnSiO suffers from the intrinsic drawbacks of low electronic/ionic conductivity and capacity fading upon cycling, limiting its application in next-generation lithium-ion batteries. In this review, the recent efforts to improve the electrochemical performances of LiMnSiO were introduced. In particular, we provided a critical overview of the effective modification methods related to the LiMnSiO cathode materials. The synthesis, structure, morphologies and physicochemical (especially electrochemical) performances of these promising cathode materials have been discussed in detail. We anticipate that this review will shed light on the sustainable development of high-performance and low cost Li-ion batteries...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of mechanical and thermal properties of ceramic pebble beds, {{such as the}} <b>lithium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> or lithium metatitanate, is a key issue {{in the framework of}} fusion power technology, for the reason that they are possible candidates in the design of breeder blankets. The paper deals with an experimental method for the evaluation of the thermal conductivity of ceramic pebble beds versus the temperature and compressive strain, based on a steady state heat flux through a material (alumina) of known conductivity. The alumina thermal conductivity is determined by means of the hot wire method. To assess the experimental method, a thermo-mechanical characterization of alumina pebble beds (a material largely available), having different diameters, considering a wide range of temperatures and compression forces has been carried out...|$|E
40|$|Solid sorbents {{based on}} <b>lithium</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> (Li 4 SiO 4) have shown promise for CO 2 capture at high temperature. Improved {{sorption}} properties {{can be obtained}} by appropriate doping. In this study, different promoted Li 4 SiO 4 -based sorbents were prepared by addition of potassium carbonate and binary/ternary alkali (Li, K and Na) carbonate eutectic mixtures. The CO 2 sorption properties of the sorbents were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) at different temperatures in the range between 500 and 600 °C and at low CO 2 partial pressure (0. 04 atm). The results showed that all the promoters used noticeably improved the CO 2 sorption capacity in comparison to no-promoted Li 4 SiO 4. At the optimum sorption temperature of 580 °C, Li 4 SiO 4 with addition of 30 wt...|$|E
40|$|Crushing {{strength}} of the breeder materials (<b>lithium</b> <b>orthosilicate,</b> Li 4 SiO 4 or OSi) {{in the form of}} peb-bles to be used for EU solid breeder concept is investigated. The pebbles are fabricated using a melt-spray method and hence a size variation in the pebbles produced is expected. The knowledge of the mechanical integrity (crush strength) of the pebbles is important for a successful design of breeder blanket. In this paper, we present the ex-perimental results of the crush (failure) loads for spherical OSi pebbles of different diameters rang-ing from 250 µm to 800 µm. The ultimate failure load for each size shows a Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the mean crush load increases with increase in pebble diameter. It is also observed that the level of opacity of the pebble influences the crush load significantly. The experimental data presented in this paper and the associated analysis could possibly help us to develop a framework for simulating a crushable polydisperse pebble assem-bly using discrete element method.

40|$|Polyoxyanion compounds, {{particularly}} the olivine phosphate LiFePO 4, are receiving considerable attention as cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries. Despite its numerous advantages, olivine phosphate severely suffers from poor rate performance {{due to its}} inherent conducting properties and limited capacity. More recently, an entirely new class of polyoxyanion cathodes based on the orthosilicates (Li 2 MSiO 4, M = Fe, Mn, and Co), has been attracting growing interest. Li 2 MSiO 4 has two lithium ions per formula unit, suggesting a higher theoretical capacity than phosphate. <b>Lithium</b> iron <b>orthosilicate,</b> Li 2 FeSiO 4, is very important member of orthosilicates family due to its electrochemical stability, cell safety, eco-friendliness, and cost effectiveness. It is proposed as another promising alternative cathode material for the same lattice stabilization effect as in LiFePO 4 through the presence of strong Si–O bond. The lower electronegativity of Si vs. P {{would result in a}} lowering of the Fe 2 +↔Fe 3 + couple and therefore Li 2 FeSiO 4 often possesses a lower electronic band gap and higher electronic conductivity in comparison with LiFePO 4. Although Li 2 FeSiO 4 is known for several years, it is still a challenge obtaining a phase pure material with desired particle size and good electrochemical characteristics. Here we report citric acid assisted sol-gel method for Li 2 FeSiO 4 /C composite synthesis. Starting compounds were LiNO 3, Fe(NO 3) 3 and Si(OC 2 H 5) 4 (tetraethyl orthosilicate, abbrev. TEOS). Citric acid was used as a chelating agent. Sol-gel preparation of Li 2 FeSiO 4 /C powder was conducted via two routes: (i) one starting from water solutions of above mentioned compounds and (ii) other starting from ethanol solutions of the same compounds. Synthesis in alcohol solution proved to be much faster due to fast hydrolysis of TEOS in presence of alcohol and rapid gel formation. Final product obtained from alcohol solution contains a higher percentage of carbon...|$|R
40|$|Vanadium {{substitution}} is {{an interesting}} approach to manipulate {{the properties of the}} poor electronic and ionic conducting <b>lithium</b> transition metal <b>orthosilicates.</b> Especially, if incorporated on the Si site, it could alter the highly insulating character of the SiO 4 framework. This study addresses the feasibility and limitations of V substitution in Li 2 MnSiO 4. Nominal compositions of Li 2 Mn 1 –xVxSiO 4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 2) and Li 2 MnSi 1 –xVxO 4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 3) were synthesized by a sol–gel method, and the structural evolution was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). While the solid solubility of V on tetrahedral Mn sites was shown to be limited, substantial amounts of V entered the structure when intended to substitute Si. Elemental mapping by TEM showed that V was highly inhomogeneously distributed, and high energy resolution EELS demonstrated that the majority of V was present in a tetravalent state. The nominal compositions Li 2 MnSi 1 –xVxO 4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 3) showed superior electrochemical performance, with reduced charge transfer resistance and an increased Li ion diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry revealed increased redox activity which can be attributed to V within the concentration series. The best performance was achieved with 25 mol % V substitution. V substitution beyond 25 mol % caused deterioration of the properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{aspiration}} of today’s {{society to}} become independent from crude oil {{and nuclear power}} led to a rapid growth of renewable energy production. Unfortunately, {{the majority of these}} energy sources are discontinuous and require energy storage. Alongside this, particularly in Norway, a trend towards electric transportation is observed. Even if details differ, both applications require advanced battery technologies to store energy and facilitate it with a high conversion rate when needed. Li-ion batteries outperform other battery concepts, but the technology has to be advanced {{in order to meet the}} demands of specific applications. In particular, the common positive Li-ion electrode (LiCoO 2) has safety and pricing issues to be overcome. Not to mention that it also limits the battery capacity. Both safety and moderate cost are of major importance for the large-scale batteries required in electric vehicles and in stationary energy storage. This study concerns an alternative positive electrode material class, namely the <b>lithium</b> transition metal <b>orthosilicates</b> (Li 2 MSiO 4). These materials consist of abundant elements Fe, Mn and Si and could hence considerably reduce the cost of Li-ion electrodes. In addition, these materials could theoretically double the capacity by a two-electron reaction. Unfortunately, the orthosilicates are poor conductors and require nanoarchitectures and conductive coatings to be applicable as an electrode. In this study, the impact of morphology, conductive coating and the incorporation of foreign elements into the structure are examined and discussed. Nanostructured orthosilicates were synthesised by wet chemical and flame assisted processes. A small particle size (< 50 nm) in combination with a conductive carbon coating and a high level of porosity was found to be crucial for the electrode performance. Furthermore, it was shown that replacing silicon with small amounts of vanadium had a huge, positive impact on the performance. Finally, a time-efficient flame method for high throughput synthesis of high quality nanosized orthosilicates was developed...|$|R
