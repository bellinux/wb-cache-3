5000|$|Fulvio {{arrives in}} a small town in Campania, after being fired from the company where he worked. In the country, Fulvio stays with his brother, Don Germano, the minister. Fulvio understands that the {{situation}} in the country is desperate. Don Germano reveals that the situations is dire because Upper Citadel does not come in tourism, so the amenities are ancient as the citizens. Fulvio notices a <b>loose</b> <b>panel</b> on the ceiling of the chapel that pours water on the face of the statue of St. Thomas. Fulvio as a management professional researches about miracles and makes plans. One day, while Fr. Don Germano is celebrating Mass, a devout old woman sees these drops, believes they are tears and declares to the others that it is a miracle. The news spreads, and so leads to pilgrimages from cities all over Italy to see the statue of the sad saint. Fulvio exploits this to the maximum with various branding and marketing strategies. This brings economic benefit for the town as well as the orphanage. However, members of the Lower Citadel are not happy with popularity and the Vatican wants to see clearly on the matter ...meanwhile Fulvio is lovestruck and is offered a job in the city. Does the town get a second-chance, will there be a divine intervention.|$|E

The technique goes back to Neolithic times.|$|R

50|$|The comic is high-contrast {{black and}} white with stylized and {{geometric}} cartoon characters. Graphical perspective is often very <b>loose.</b> The <b>panel</b> borders are jagged, and certain strips have messages hidden in the complex designs of the borders. Many of the characters are thin nearly {{to the point of}} being stick figures. Several of the characters, including Johnny, wear T-shirts with expressive messages that change from panel to panel. Vasquez often breaks the fourth wall with side comments to talk about the book, its audience, or himself. The speech balloons change with the moods of the characters. For example, Johnny's word balloons grow thorns when he becomes angry.|$|R

5000|$|In December 1992, Detective Pautz of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department was {{conducting}} drug interdiction {{when he noticed}} a 1981 two door Oldsmobile with California plates. [...] Pautz radioed his dispatcher to check the registration of the car, and he ran {{the name of the}} owner, Miguel Ledesma Ornelas, through the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS). NADDIS reported that Ornelas was a heroin dealer. Two more officers arrived on the scene. An officer asked Ornelas if he had any contraband in the car, and Ornelas responded negatively. Detective Hurrle requested permission to search the car, and Ornelas consented. Deputy Luedke searched the car and noticed a <b>loose</b> door <b>panel</b> with a rusty screw. Deputy Luedke removed the panel and found two kilograms of cocaine. Ornelas and his accomplice, Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma, were arrested.|$|R
50|$|Back at the {{internment}} camp, as Worf {{is fighting}} the Jem'Hadar commander, three Jem'Hadar enter the cell and question the prisoners about {{the whereabouts of}} Garak, {{who has not been}} seen in some time. They discover the <b>loose</b> wall <b>panels,</b> and come close to discovering Garak when the prisoners successfully overpower their guards. In the combat ring, Worf is clearly defeated, but refuses to yield. Ikat'ika, the Jem'Hadar commander, is impressed by Worf's determination to fight to what ultimately would be his death; Ikat'ika himself yields the fight, saying that he can't defeat Worf - only kill him - and Ikat'ika is uninterested in that. This enrages the Vorta, who orders Ikat'ika's immediate execution. As the troops turn their guns to Worf, Garak manages to engage the transmitter, and they are beamed away to the orbiting runabout at the last second along with a Romulan captive.|$|R
5000|$|Morgan {{appeared}} on ITV's <b>Loose</b> Women <b>panel</b> show in late January 2017, however, did {{object to the}} then recent Executive Order 13769 which bans visits to the US from citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, [...] "but let’s not just say that every time he speaks he’s a monster, because it’s not true". Nearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Morgan said [...] "There is no Muslim ban", as [...] "85% of the world's Muslims are allowed in the country". Another participant in the discussion, Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, immediately told him to [...] "f*** off", adding in part [...] "Hitler didn’t kill the Jews on the first day, he worked up to it". After the novelist J. K. Rowling tweeted [...] "Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to f*** off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined", the two began an exchange of words on the social media site.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 March 1941, Allard was {{scheduled}} to take the newly promoted Pilot Officer Francis [...] "Frank" [...] Walker-Smith to RAF Ford to collect {{a version of the}} twin-engined Douglas Boston (known to the RAF as the Douglas Havoc and used primarily for night-fighting duties). At the last moment New Zealand ace Pilot Officer William Henry [...] "Ace" [...] Hodgson (who was reputed to have a girlfriend at RAF Ford) hitched a lift. A <b>loose</b> gun inspection <b>panel</b> became dislodged and flew back jamming the rudder. This caused the aircraft to crash, killing all three occupants at Wimbish, close to RAF Debden.|$|R

50|$|The mirror behind Mary {{shows the}} scene in reverse, making it even more {{explicit}} that the two panels are placed {{in the same room}} and time, even though the actual configuration seen in the mirror does not match {{the scene in}} the main painting. Memling only included the mirror in a later stage of the composition. This unity of space was also emphasized by small details like the carpet to the left of Mary, which reappears beneath the hands of van Nieuwenhove. The work was probably intended to be displayed with the two panels at an angle, but it is uncertain how exactly they should be placed. One posibility is that it was intended to be hung from a wall or column, with the Virign panel fixed and the van Nieuwenhove <b>panel</b> <b>loose.</b>|$|R
