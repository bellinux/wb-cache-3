5|$|Ellis {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1974 season, pitching to a 3–8 win-loss record and 4.54 ERA through July 10. Subsequently he won eight consecutive games and nine out of ten, pitching seven completed games in that ten-game stretch. A <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> off of the bat of Willie Montañez fractured the fifth metacarpal bone in Ellis' pitching hand on September 10, prematurely ending his season. Ellis had the seventh best walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (1.155). The Pirates won the NL East, but they lost the 1974 NLCS three games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E

5|$|Ruffing turned {{forty years}} of age during the war, {{resulting}} in his discharge in June 1945. He rejoined the Yankees that month, signing for the same $20,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms) he earned in 1942. He made his first appearance with the Yankees since the 1942season in July 1945. Pitching for the Yankees as a spot starter in 1946, he had a 5–1 win-loss record and a 1.77 ERA when he suffered a broken kneecap from a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> hit by Hank Majeski, and missed {{the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Suffering from {{recurrent}} knee injuries, the Yankees released Ruffing {{after the}} 1946 season.

In May, the White Sox removed Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with another <b>line</b> <b>drive.</b> He rejoined the White Sox' active roster in July. He pitched to a 3–5 win–loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched on the season. Ruffing retired after the 1947 season.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth was the first-base umpire for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In the third inning, Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base umpire Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} be thrown by a Mets pitcher. Santana benefited from a close call on the third base line by umpire Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltrán <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E

5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was able to get up and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{he had an}} 11–9 win-loss {{record with}} a career low 3.12 earned run average in 25 games. His 3.12 earned run average was good for eighth in the league. However, Bickford broke a finger in 1951 after {{being hit by a}} <b>line</b> <b>drive,</b> missed most of the final three months of the season and never regained his prior form. In 1952, he was 7–12 with a 3.74 earned run average in 26 games, 22 of them starts. He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season; however, he {{suffered}} from bone spurs in his pitching arm. During the 1953 season, Bickford had a 2–5 win-loss record with a 5.28 earned run average.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2016, Hughes {{was struck}} in the left knee off a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> from J. T. Realmuto and left the game.

On June 11, it was revealed that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee. On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. On June 28th, Hughes' season was declared over as he was set to undergo season ending surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. He finished the 2016 season with a 1-7 record for the Twins.|$|E

5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the <b>line</b> <b>drive,</b> {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E

40|$|Clumps in {{hot star}} winds can {{originate}} from shock compression {{due to the}} <b>line</b> <b>driven</b> instability. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations reveal a radial wind structure consisting of highly compressed shells separated by voids, and colliding with fast clouds. Two-dimensional simulations are still largely missing, despite first attempts. Clumpiness dramatically affects the radiative transfer and thus all wind diagnostics in the UV, optical, and in X-rays. The microturbulence approximation applied hitherto is currently superseded by a more sophisticated radiative transfer in stochastic media. Besides clumps, i. e. jumps in the density stratification, so-called kinks in the velocity law, i. e. jumps in dv/dr, play an eminent role in hot star winds. Kinks are {{a new type of}} radiative-acoustic shock, and propagate at super-Abbottic speed. 1 <b>Line</b> <b>Driven</b> Instability in 1 -D Clumps in hot star winds can be created by shock compression, where the shocks occur as result of the <b>line</b> <b>driven</b> instability, as first suggested by Lucy & Solomon (1970).

5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> in the pitching arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Linde {{made his}} major league debut with the Indians on September 11, 1947, which {{ended up being}} his only {{appearance}} of the season. In that one appearance, he pitched ⅔ of an inning and allowed two earned run, finishing the game and season with an ERA of 27.00. During the off-season, Linde played basketball with the Olo Soaps, a team located in his native Beaver Dam. He took part in spring training {{with the rest of}} the Indians roster for the 1948 Cleveland Indians season. In late March, however, he was struck on the chin from a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> hit by Indians manager Lou Boudreau, causing him to be sidelined for several days. By the end of spring training, Linde remained a part of the Indians roster. He pitched three games for the Indians early on in 1948, pitching ten innings, allowing six earned runs and finishing the season with a 5.40 ERA. After three games, he was demoted to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He spent the rest of the 1948 season as a starting pitcher for Baltimore. His performances included a one-hit victory in his first appearance for the club. Linde finished the season with a 5–9 record and a 4.50 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have been wrong by video replays.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory.

The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild-card victory. However, Hoffman blew the save, allowing doubles to Matsui and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8–8. Hoffman then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and third base. Carroll then hit a <b>line</b> <b>drive</b> to right fielder Brian Giles.
