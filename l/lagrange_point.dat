5|$|Trojan moons are {{a unique}} feature only {{known from the}} Saturnian system. A trojan body orbits at either the leading L4 or {{trailing}} L5 <b>Lagrange</b> <b>point</b> {{of a much larger}} object, such as a large moon or planet. Tethys has two trojan moons, Telesto (leading) and Calypso (trailing), and Dione also has two, Helene (leading) and Polydeuces (trailing). Helene is by far the largest trojan moon, while Polydeuces is the smallest and has the most chaotic orbit. These moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothened out their surfaces.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{possible}} to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in {{the gravity of the}} planets and moons of the Solar System. For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth's Trojan points. Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>point</b> (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{ballistic}} trajectories to {{and from}} the vicinity of the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> L 1 and L 2 and the surfaces of the primaries in the circular restricted three-body problem. The study focuses on trajectories from the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> and their Lyapunov orbits that can access the entire surfaces of the primary bodies for the sun-Earth and Earth-moon systems. By a symmetry property, trajectories leaving the surface of the primary bodies and reaching the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> and their Lyapunov orbits can also be found. The lowest velocity increment providing such whole-surface coverage from the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> and the lowest-energy Lyapunov orbit providing whole-surface coverage are found.

2500|$|The reason {{these points}} are in balance is that, at [...] and , the {{distances}} {{to the two}} masses are equal. Accordingly, the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies {{are in the same}} ratio as the masses of the two bodies, and so the resultant force acts through the barycenter of the system; additionally, the geometry of the triangle ensures that the resultant acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same ratio as for the two massive bodies. The barycenter being both the center of mass and center of rotation of the three-body system, this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>point</b> in orbital equilibrium with the other two larger bodies of system. (Indeed, the third body need not have negligible mass.) The general triangular configuration was discovered by Lagrange in work on the three-body problem.|$|E
40|$|While the three-body {{problem has}} been without an exact {{analytical}} solution for some 400 odd years, we have {{learned a great deal}} about the dynamics of three-body systems in that time. There are five points relative to two massive bodies where a third body will remain in a stable orbit. These are called the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points.</b> Two of these points, located at the vertices of equilateral triangles, are stable equilibria. We find clear evidence for these stable points within our own solar system, most notably Jupiter 2 Ì† 7 s Trojan satellites. It may be possible to place a massive body at one of these triangular <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> for the Earth-Moon system. This third massive body might be used to occult bright objects for deep space astronomy or to mine for platinum and other useful materials. The question then arises: how massive an object can one place at one of these triangular <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points?</b> Here we present answers to this question. There is the possibility of placing an object at both of the triangular <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> simultaneously. We present an analysis of the relative motion of the Earth-Moon system when two massive bodies are added to the configuration. The system will remain stable if any two near Earth asteroids are placed at these <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

We revealed that this is caused by the forced oscillation term due to the third and other perturbing bodies since the net of gravity force of the primary and secondary bodies almost vanishes around the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points</b> in the corotational coordinate system. Taking into account the direct effects of the other perturbing bodies including the effects of their eccentricities up to the second order, we constructed an analytical theory of the motion of the test particle being linear with respect to the magnitude of departure from the <b>Lagrange</b> <b>points,</b> in the planar restricted N-body problem. We compared our analytical solution with a numerical integration and confirmed that the solution represents the linear part of the true solution so well that the residuals are only due to the non-linear effect of the primary and the secondary system mainly which we ignored. By using the solution, we discussed the global aspects of the orbit such as the existence region or the averaged position.
