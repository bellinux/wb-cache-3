Excessive focus on civil-political liberties {{during the early stages}} of national development would impair this. However, the Government appears to have loosened restrictions on political liberties like free speech over time to manage demands for a more participatory political culture. In fact, citizens were urged by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong not to be [...] "passive bystanders in their own fate" [...] but to debate issues [...] "with reason, passion and conviction". Wrestling with [...] "honest differences" [...] was to be preferred over being [...] "an apathetic society with no view".|$|E
40|$|This study uses {{a set of}} firm-level {{data from}} Worldscope to {{examine the impact of}} {{national}} <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> on audit markets across 39 countries. Our auditor choice and audit fee results support the legal cost hypothesis that Big Five auditors charge a higher risk premium {{and are more likely to}} turn away risky clients in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> than in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> We also find that the complementary effect outweighs the legal cost effect in that strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> do not reduce the market share of high quality auditors, but they enhance the development of capital markets, which in turn creates a higher demand for quality audit service. Our general sample results show that firms in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments,</b> ceteris paribus, are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than their counterparts operating in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments.</b> However, among the large firms in the sample, which are more likely to have international investors, we document evidence supporting the substitution effect hypothesis that firms in weak <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than firms in strong <b>legal</b> <b>environments</b> because external auditors may serve as a substitute for legal protection t...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how company-level corporate governance practices and country-level legal investor protection jointly affect company performance. We {{find that in}} any legal regime {{there are a few}} specific governance practices that improve performance.

2500|$|In the country, Ottokar's {{introduction}} of the Law of Emphyteusis into the Czech law is sometimes interpreted as [...] "Germanization". In fact it was progressive, for it freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent — and tax, if such was levied.

2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the new mejba and military service, on 23 April 1861 Sadok Bey promulgated the first written constitution in the Arab world, separating executive, legislative and judiciary powers, through a new Supreme Council, legislature and court system and thereby limiting his own powers. [...] This constitution reaffirmed the [...] equality of rights for Muslims, Christians (effectively, therefore, for Europeans) and for Jews; in particular, concerning the right to own property. This created a new <b>legal</b> <b>environment</b> which encouraged Europeans to set up businesses in Tunisia. The new constitution was not popular. The new Supreme Council was filled with placemen of the Grand Vizier Mustapha Khaznadar, mamluks, and others of Turkish and non-native descent, with few of the traditional Arab tribal leaders of the interior. [...] The customary links between ruler and ruled were displaced, and it became harder for the sheikhs outside Tunis to gain audience.
