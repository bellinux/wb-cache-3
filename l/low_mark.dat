2500|$|Upon {{digestion}} of carbohydrates, glucose {{levels in}} the blood will begin to rise. [...] As the blood and glucose flow into the pancreas, insulin and amylin are co-secreted by the pancreatic beta cells directly into the bloodstream in response to elevated blood glucose levels. In the presence of glucose these insulin responses are almost exclusively delivered in boluses every 4 to 6 minutes. Insulin causes blood glucose {{to be removed from}} the bloodstream and stored in the liver and muscle cells. As the blood sugar goes higher, additional insulin will bring the blood sugar back down in a classic negative feedback loop. [...] As insulin is released from the beta cells, amylin is also released into the bloodstream. [...] Amylin slows gastric emptying, and also inhibits the release of glucagon from the pancreatic alpha cells. [...] The effect of amylin is to spread out the blood glucose peak after eating, reducing the quantity of insulin needed. [...] As the blood sugar level comes back toward normal, the beta cells will stop spurting insulin and amylin. [...] As the glucose level approaches a <b>low</b> <b>mark,</b> the pancreatic alpha cells will release glucagon directly into the bloodstream. [...] Glucagon causes the liver to release stored glucose back into the bloodstream. [...] Increased glucagon will increase blood glucose levels to produce a positive error in the negative feedback loop. [...] Together, the three endocrine hormones work as a system to maintain the blood glucose level between high and low boundaries. By delivering the insulin in boluses as presented by a non-diabetic pancreas, the goal of an artificial pancreas can be achieved.|$|E

3000|$|Combining the {{analysis}} of Matérn type II model and the MHCP model, we propose the MMHCP model to estimate the retaining probability of initial deployed nodes. In this section, we firstly focus {{on the condition that}} fading is uniform, or fixed fading. In MMHCP model, we consider the simultaneously transmitting nodes (retained nodes) under CSMA protocol include those nodes with the <b>lowest</b> <b>mark</b> and the nodes that have the second <b>lowest</b> <b>mark</b> in the domain of itself while the node with the <b>lowest</b> <b>mark</b> has not been retained. It can be formally expressed as follows: ∼Φ_t={x_i:∀x_j∈ N(x_i),x_ix_j,m_i<m_j}∪{x_i:∃x_j∈ N(x_i),m_i>m_j,∀x_k∈ N(x_i){x_i,x_j},m_k>m_i,x_j is not retained}.

50|$|Rubrics {{are used}} for marking. Their purpose is for a more {{objective}} marking process when marking subjective items. i.e. an essay, piece of artwork, tech project, or any project with multiple components i.e. computer program. They also aim to avoid student/teacher confusion. Rubrics provide a breakdown of these four strands. These strands are not weighted evenly. For example If a student receives a <b>low</b> <b>mark</b> in {{only one of the}} rows, their overall grade could be drastically reduced if that strand is weighted heavier than the others. Similarly, if one receives a <b>low</b> <b>mark</b> in a strand that is not weighed heavily, it can have little effect on their mark.|$|E

In practice, scribes mostly employed the terminal dot; the others fell out of use and were later replaced by other symbols.
