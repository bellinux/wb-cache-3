5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to examine the}} peak {{entrance}} surface air kerma (peak ESAK) to the eyes during CT fluoroscopy lung biopsy, and the impact of <b>lead</b> <b>glasses,</b> exposure parameters, head rotation, and height on peak ESAK to the eyes. Two phantoms simulating the patient and radiologist were used, and 108 exposures were made using a 16 -slice Toshiba Alexion CT scanner (Toshiba Medical Systems, Nasu, Japan). ESAK to the phantom radiologist’s right eye was measured using an Unfors Xi dosimeter (RaySafe, Billdal, Sweden) with and without <b>lead</b> <b>glasses</b> at two kilovoltages (120 kVp and 135 kVp) and three milliampere settings (10 mA, 20 mA, and 30 mA.

50|$|Traditionally, flint <b>glasses</b> were <b>lead</b> <b>glasses</b> {{containing}} around 4-60% lead(II) oxide; {{however, the}} manufacture {{and disposal of}} these glasses were sources of pollution. In many modern flint <b>glasses,</b> <b>lead</b> oxides are replaced with other metal oxides such as titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide without significantly altering the optical properties of the glass.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. <b>Lead</b> <b>glass</b> is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>glass,</b> {{commonly}} called crystal, is {{a variety of}} glass in which lead replaces the calcium content of a typical potash glass. <b>Lead</b> <b>glass</b> contains typically 18–40% (by weight) lead(II) oxide (PbO), while modern lead crystal, historically also known as flint glass due to the original silica source, contains a minimum of 24% PbO. <b>Lead</b> <b>glass</b> is desirable owing to its decorative properties.|$|E

Despite the number of reports about lead tocicity, very little information has been obtained regarding its effects on erythrocytes. For this reason, the morphological effects of lead on human erythrociyte were investigated. Four lead and four no <b>lead</b> crystal <b>glasses</b> were bougth and divided two groups each other. After completing the decontamination process, 200 ml of blood, or water were poured into one of the four lead and no <b>lead</b> crystal <b>glasses.</b> We measured concentrations of lead that leached into water and blood that were stored in lead and no <b>lead</b> crystal <b>glasses</b> for 1 -, 2 -, …. and 10 - day periods at room temperature. Lead concentrations in the liquid matrix were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Significant amounts of lead leached into the liquid within one day; 724 µg/L in blood, 820 µg/L in water. Lead continued to leach into both blood and water with the passage of time; 1832 µg/L in blood, 1653 µg/L in water (10 th day results). Lead release was less in water than blood.

40|$|Background/Aims: During {{endoscopic}} retrograde cholan-giopancreatography (ERCP), {{all efforts}} {{should be made to}} be aware of radiation hazards and to reduce radiation exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the status of radia-tion protective equipment and the awareness of radiation ex-posure in health care providers performing ERCP in Korean hospitals. Methods: A survey with a total of 42 questions was sent to each respondent via mail or e-mail between October 2010 and March 2011. The survey targeted nurses and radiation technicians who participated in ERCP in sec-ondary or tertiary referral centers. Results: A total of 78 pro-viders from 38 hospitals responded to the surveys (response rate, 52 %). The preparation and actual utilization rates of protective equipment were 55. 3 % and 61. 9 % for lead shields, 100 % and 98. 7 % for lead aprons, 47. 4 % and 37. 8 % for <b>lead</b> <b>glasses,</b> 97. 4 % and 94. 7 % for thyroid shields, and 57. 7 % and 68. 9 % for radiation dosimeters, respectively.

25|$|Addition of lead(II) oxide lowers melting point, lowers {{viscosity}} of the melt, {{and increases}} refractive index. Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides {{and is used}} in colored glasses. The viscosity decrease of <b>lead</b> <b>glass</b> melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders.
