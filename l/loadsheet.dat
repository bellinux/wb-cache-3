5000|$|On 12 January 1999 a F-27 (registration: G-CHNL) {{operating}} a cargo flight for Channel Express arriving from Luton crashed short of runway 27 after deploying full flap on approach. As the flap deployed, the cargo moved aft and exited the aeroplane's {{mass and balance}} limits, the flight crew initiated a go-around which further exacerbated problem by raising the gear and applying power. The aeroplane pitched up uncontrollably and stalled {{which resulted in the}} aircraft impacting the conservatory of a house located under the flight path. Fortunately no one on the ground was injured, however both flight crew were killed by the resulting fire which engulfed the aircraft. The investigation concluded the aeroplane was not loaded in accordance with the <b>loadsheet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 {{concerns}} were raised {{as to the}} quality of work the Global Load Control center in Cape Town was able to deliver, with one client airline calling for Lufthansa's load control operations for Frankfurt airport to be moved back to Frankfurt. In response to this criticism, Lufthansa has stated that a move towards remote centralized load controlling and from manual <b>loadsheets</b> to electronic <b>loadsheets</b> was in the airlines best interest, and that steps have been taken to address the concerns about quality. Since then, Global Load Control has received its Dekra ISO 9001:2008 certification, and states on its corporate website that it is committed to ...producing a quality service by focusing on the principles of safety, punctuality and economy..., and that its quality management systems are continually reviewed and improved.|$|R

We {{become acquainted with}} centralised load control centres and the principles of their functioning. Centralised load control centres will be compared with conventional workplaces at the airports...|$|R
40|$|This final degree project {{analyses}} {{the implementation}} of the eLoadsheet tool, a novel software the objective of which is the auto generation and management of <b>loadsheets</b> in Vueling Airlines. This analysis is performed {{from the point of view}} of the Flight Operations Engineering Department. The implementation process took place within the first quarter of 2016, although by June of 2016, the implantation still has to be considered partial. The main purpose that is pursued is the homogenization and centralization of the system that manages <b>loadsheets,</b> by defining the new concept of Vueling Departure Control System (VDCS), with the progressive implantation of this system in the different airports being operated by the airline. The main aims of the work are fundamentally two. On the one hand, to study in depth the new system, by detailing its characteristics, precusors, interaction with other already existent systems and instructions and examples of use of administrator and user environments. On the other hand, to analyze the whole implantation of this tool, from the Flight Operations Engineering perspective, by studying the evolution of the tasks of this department with regard to weight and balance control, due to the introduction of eLoadsheet. This analysis will be performed qualitatively, by detailing the different workflows, as well as quantitatively, by defining some metrics or objective indicators. Likewise, to complete the two previous aims, a real practical case of utilization of eLoadsheet is included, which corresponds to the procedure carried out by Flight Operations Engineering, in relation to VDCS, for the inclusion of the new Airbus A 321 - 231 (EC-MLD) in the Vueling Airlines fleet. Regarding the conclusions of the work, it has been confirmed some aspects already expected, like the extreme importance that entails the weight and balance control tasks in the daily operation of an airline, and the complexity of implementing a new system which is able to centralize and homogenize the generation of the <b>loadsheets,</b> an essential document for all the flights. Moreover, during and once the development of this project is ended, by analyzing the defined metrics, it has been noted that the apparition of the concept VDCS entails a significant reduction of workload for Flight Operations Engineering Department. Nevertheless, it does not mean a reduction of its responsibilities, due to the new task of the management of the new system. Besides, it is observed the need of an extension of VDCS to a greater number of airports, in order to achieve a better evolution of the results in comparison to the existent previous situation...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor’s thesis “Aircraft {{load and}} balance procedures”, {{deals with the}} balance of the {{aircraft}} and center of gravity and with possible computational procedures. It introduces the individual masses andpre-flight documentation, which is important for proper loading and balancing of an aircraft. The thesis presents a brief summary of the requirements of Ryanair airline, in particular relating to documentation and balance. The conclusion contains a comparison of manual and electronic <b>Loadsheet</b> in terms of balancing the Boeing 737 - 800 aircraft...|$|E
