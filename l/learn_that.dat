They investigate and <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour.

5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} between implicit and explicit processes during skill learning, in terms of top-down <b>learning</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> goes from explicit to implicit knowledge) versus bottom-up <b>learning</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> goes from implicit to explicit knowledge). Instead of studying each type of knowledge (implicit or explicit) in isolation, we stress {{the interaction between}} the two types, especially in terms of one type giving rise to the other, and its e#ects on learning. The work presents an integrated model of skill <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> takes into account both implicit and explicit processes and both top-down and bottom-up learning. We examine and simulate human data in the Tower of Hanoi task. The paper shows how the quantitative data in this task may be captured using either top-down or bottom-up approaches, although top-down learning is a more apt explanation of the human data currently available. These results illustrate the two different directions of learning (top-down versus bottom-up), and thereby provide a new perspective on skill learning...|$|R

They <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages, and Vivi was a prototype. After stopping the Mist creation, the group meets Amarant, hired by Brahne to capture Garnet, who joins them instead. They also <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Garnet is originally from the same destroyed village as Eiko, and has the power to summon eidolons, which was the reason she was adopted by Brahne.
