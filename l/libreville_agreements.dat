25|$|On 25 August 2008 the CPJP finally acceded to the <b>Libreville</b> {{comprehensive}} <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, a loose rebel {{coalition}} {{named the}} Séléka initiated a military campaign {{to overthrow the}} government of the Central African Republic (CAR) and its then-president, Francois Bozizé. The Séléka, composed mostly of factions of armed groups in the northeast of the state, accused Bozizé's government of neglecting their region. They rapidly captured several strategic towns and were poised to take the capital city of Bangui. A hasty intervention by Chad and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) persuaded the Séléka to negotiate with Bozizé's government. The result, the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Agreement</b> of January 2013, installed a three-year power-sharing arrangement.|$|R
50|$|However, ECCAS {{failed to}} monitor the {{implementation}} of the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Agreement</b> and Bozizé did not undertake any of the reforms necessary under the transition agreement. Séléka resurged and took control of Bangui and fifteen of CAR's sixteen provinces on 24 March 2013. Séléka's leader, Michel Djotodia, proclaimed himself President, set up the National Transitional Council (NTC), and suspended CAR's constitution. A hurried ECCAS summit on 4 April 2013, which did not yet recognize Djotodia as President, called {{for the creation of a}} Transitional National Council (TNC), which would create a new constitution, conduct elections in eighteen months, and select an interim President. On 13 April, the TNC chose the sole candidate vying for interim president position, Michel Djotodia.|$|R
50|$|On 5 December 2013, the UNSC {{unanimously}} passed resolution 2127 {{which called}} for support of the <b>Libreville</b> <b>agreement</b> that initiated a temporary ceasefire in the country. It also called for Séléka and other armed groups {{to lay down their}} arms, called for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), or Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR), and looked forward to the immediate deployment of MISCA to be supported by the African Union (which will still lead the new integrated mission). This replaces the existing mission from the African Union and the FOMAC operation from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), as well as their Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in Central African Republic (MICOPAX), which are all working with the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA).|$|R
2500|$|On 9 May 2008 the APRD {{signed a}} cease fire and peace {{agreement}} with the government in <b>Libreville.</b> The <b>agreement</b> was completed {{under the auspices of}} an ad hoc committee of CEMAC led by President Omar Bongo of Gabon. Jean Jacques Demafouth signed on behalf of the APRD and DDR minister Cyriaque Gonda on behalf of the government. A six-person board was established to monitor the implementation of the agreement's terms.|$|R
25|$|The APRD {{agreement}} {{paved the}} way for further peace talks. On 21 June 2008 the FDPC joined the APRD and UFDR in signing the <b>Libreville</b> Comprehensive Peace <b>Agreement,</b> which reiterated and extended the provisions of the previous two agreements.|$|R
5000|$|In the beginning, the {{international}} {{response to the}} coup was purely diplomatic: members of the International Contact Group insisted that Michel Djotodia respect the principles {{set out in the}} <b>Libreville</b> <b>agreement.</b> The African Union was the first to react when it announced a new African-led International Support Mission for CAR (MISCA) in July 2013. However, MISCA has not been effective in reversing the deteriorating security situation. Although its mandate is well-defined, there is general agreement that it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. The UN General Assembly put CAR on {{the international}} agenda in September. Resolution 2121, adopted on 10 October 2013 and sponsored by France, strengthened and broadened the mandate of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). Aware that MISCA alone is unable to adequately tackle the growing insecurity, France has changed its initial position from disengagement to military contribution, as announced by François Hollande on 20 November 2013, who said that French forces would be reinforced by almost 1,000 troops for a six-month period. France began to deploy troops in CAR after receiving authorization from the Security Council on 5 December 2013 with Resolution 2127, which authorizes MISCA and French forces to take [...] "all necessary measures" [...] to protect civilians and restore security in CAR. French soldiers immediately began to patrol in Bangui.|$|R
