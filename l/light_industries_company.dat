50|$|The {{prototype}} SZ-1 {{was developed}} by a design group formed by engineers from many units. The project commenced in 1969 {{under the guidance of}} the Ministry of <b>Light</b> <b>Industry,</b> drawing upon the resources of Shanghai Clock & Watch <b>Industry</b> <b>Company,</b> Shanghai Watch Factory, Shanghai No. 2 Watch Factory, Tianjin Clock & Watch Factory, Beijing, Liaoning, Guangzhou & Xi'an Hongqi Watch Factories, Xi'an Fenglei Meters & Watch Company, together with the Clock & Watch Research Institute of the Ministry of <b>Light</b> <b>Industry</b> in Xi'an, and the technicians and scholars of timing instruments of Tianjin University. The group studied many foreign watch designs and combined merits of them for the prototype SZ-1. Blueprints were finalized in November 1971. The resultant design most closely resembles the Enicar AR1010, found in one of the limited range of Swiss watches sold in China at that time, however {{there is no evidence of}} Enicar involvement in the SZ-1 project. A substantially larger version of the same design, designated HJ1A, {{was developed by}} Jilin Watch Factory for use in pocket watches.|$|R

40|$|The extant {{management}} accounting literature {{shows that there}} is little consensus on why and how change in {{management accounting}} systems (MAS) evolves within organisations over time (Burns and Vaivio, 2001) and especially how the change process can be conceptualised into a theoretical model (Burns and Scapens, 2000). Although Amat et al. (1994) have provided a better understanding of MAS change over time and successfully conceptualised the process into a model using the notion of dualism, they noted that the evidence of a single case study is not enough. However, there has been no further study to extend Amat et al. 's (1994) findings. This thesis resembles Amat et al. 's (1994) study, analysing the progressive formalisation of MAS in a Chinese company: Shanghai <b>Light</b> <b>Industry</b> Machinery Stock <b>Company</b> Limited, during periods of change at both the social and organisational levels. It was found that three outer, social factors (socio-economic condition, competition and socio-culture) and three inner, organisational ones (autonomy, profitability and authority) have greatly impacted on the progressive formalisation of the MAS in the Chinese company during the period studied. Also, the internal effects on the MAS change differ from the external ones, mostly reflecting the increasingly specialised managers in the company having exercised a set of proactive or intentional changes in the MAS within the corporate boundary...|$|R
