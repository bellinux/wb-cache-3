500|$|Perowne's {{world view}} is rebutted by his daughter, Daisy, a young poet. In the book's climax in chapter four, while {{he struggles to}} remain calm {{offering}} medical solutions to Baxter's illness, she quotes Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach, which calls for civilised values in the world, temporarily placating the assailant's violent mood. McEwan described his intention as wanting to [...] "play with this idea, whether we need stories". Brian Bethune interpreted McEwan's approach to Perowne as [...] "mercilessly [...] his own protagonist...But Perowne's blind spot [...] is less an author's <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> than a plea for the saving grace of literature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{elements}} that he added to Klaatu's character, screenwriter Edmund North said, [...] "It was my private <b>little</b> <b>joke.</b> I never discussed this angle with Blaustein or Wise because I didn't want it expressed. I had originally hoped that the Christ comparison would be subliminal." ...|$|E
2500|$|The charity is {{sponsored}} both corporately and individually, and {{especially with the}} help of active and retired cricketers. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, Lord's Taverners, British Land plc, Sportsmatch and the MCC support in various ways. [...] Individuals are invited to join the , a <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> suggesting that they possess money and propel the heavy roller used to flatten the cricket wicket.

60|$|You {{drive me}} mad. It's so serious, it's so tremendously serious, {{and you have}} the heart to make <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "All his <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> and things," [...] said Esmeer {{regarding}} {{his feet on}} the fender, [...] "it's just a nervous sniggering--because he's afraid.... Oxford's no better." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Keller laughed--and, more {{extraordinary}} still, Mr. Keller made a <b>little</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dorriforth. My acharnement is your <b>little</b> <b>joke,</b> and my {{contention}} {{is a little}} lesson in philosophy.|$|E
60|$|They {{laughed at}} the Colonel's mild <b>little</b> <b>joke,</b> happy {{to break through the}} cloud of doubt which oppressed them.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had moved}} close behind Lane, and fancied I {{heard him say}} softly to himself: [...] "I'll fix you so you'll be sorry for your <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> by-and-by." ...|$|R
60|$|Quashy {{opened his}} huge mouth, shut his eyes, {{and went off}} in a high falsetto--his usual mode of laughing. He always laughed at Lawrence's <b>little</b> <b>jokes,</b> whether good or bad, insomuch that the youth finally abstained from jesting as much as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pinky Dinkys are chaps who've {{had their}} buds nipped," [...] said Hatherleigh. [...] "They're Plebs {{and they know}} it. They haven't the Guts {{to get hold of}} things. And so they worry up all those silly <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> of theirs to carry it off."...|$|R
60|$|He did not condescend {{to smile}} at his own mild <b>little</b> <b>joke,</b> as he applied the {{telescope}} to his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "’It {{was only}} a <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> o’ mine,’ ses Ned, who saw ’e’d put ’is foot in it. ’Bill ’ates ’em worse than—worse than—pison.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it was {{not safe}} in this instance," [...] {{retorted}} Tom, who, no matter how serious the situation, was bound to have his <b>little</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Fanny; I {{have told}} you that I thought better of sending it. But I am not ashamed. Even if I am wrong, I suppose you are at liberty to have your <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> too, and so is Percy Maudlen. It's a letter, torn up; that's all." ...|$|R
60|$|But, in the meanwhile, {{and for a}} brief holiday, let us {{laugh and}} be as {{pleasant}} as we can. And you elder folk--a <b>little</b> <b>joking,</b> and dancing, and fooling will do even you no harm. The author wishes you a merry Christmas, and welcomes you to the Fire-side Pantomime.|$|R
60|$|Mark listened resignedly, Annaple with an {{intelligence}} that made Mr. Dutton think her the more clearheaded of the two, though still {{she could not}} refrain from her <b>little</b> <b>jokes.</b> 'I'm sure I should not mind how liquid we became if we could only run off clear of Goodenough,' she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} of a <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> that {{happened}} in Sacramento last week. You remember Dick Stannard, who died a year ago--one of your friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, {{this time}} o' year, lad. But you might hunt a bear--if he cornered you!" [...] And Tom Dillon laughed at his <b>little</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, abominable! abominable!' assented my friend, effusively. 'And then, you know, {{he likes}} to have his <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> sometimes,' he added in a {{confidential}} tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! very frank." [...] He {{would not}} take her <b>little</b> <b>jokes,</b> nor {{understand}} her little prettinesses. That {{he was a man}} not prone to joking she knew well, but still it went against the grain with her to find that he was so very hard in his replies to her attempts.|$|R

6000|$|... "Married folks, Olly," [...] said Gabriel, {{with the}} lazy, easy manner of vast matrimonial experience, [...] "married folks hev <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> and ways o' thar own. Bein' onmarried yourself, ye don't know. 'With all my worldly goods I thee endow,' thet's all--thet's what she meant, Olly. 'With all my worldly goods I thee endow.'

6000|$|... "Or rather felt," [...] added Tom, {{who had to}} {{have his}} <b>little</b> <b>joke.</b> [...] "Maybe they'll plant some {{dynamite}} under the college and blow us up!" ...|$|E
60|$|Philip was {{somewhat}} overpowered {{by the young}} gentleman's condescension. At Blackstable they had always looked upon brewing with civil contempt, the Vicar made <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> about the beerage, {{and it was a}} surprising experience for Philip to discover that Watson was such an important and magnificent fellow. He had been to Winchester and to Oxford, and his conversation impressed the fact upon one with frequency. When he discovered the details of Philip's education his manner became more patronising still.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with The Los Angeles Times, Nipsey Russell remarked {{that he had}} been inspired to become a performer around the age of 10 while watching Wiggins on stage. [...] "He came out immaculately attired in a well-dressed street suit and he tap-danced," [...] Russell said. [...] "As he danced, he told <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> in between. He was so clean in his language and was lacking in any drawl, he just inspired me. I wanted to do that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Linz {{claims he}} did not hear exactly what his manager said, and asked Mickey Mantle, seated a few rows further forward, to repeat it. Mantle, who often played <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> on his teammates, told Linz that Berra {{had asked him to}} play it louder, which Linz did. This in turn led Berra to get out of his seat and go {{to the back of the}} bus, {{supposedly}} yelling at Linz to [...] "shove it up your ass! You'd think you just won four straight!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clearwater Hall! Say, {{that must}} be a fine place to get a drink!" [...] piped in Andy; and at this <b>little</b> <b>joke</b> all of the girls giggled.|$|E
60|$|She enjoyed my <b>little</b> <b>joke,</b> {{was pleased}} that I had been won over, but refused to accept my reasoning, though the topic itself was after her heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy a {{girl like}} Emily Wharton," [...] said he, not condescending to notice her <b>little</b> <b>joke,</b> [...] "throwing over a fellow like Arthur for a greasy, black foreigner." ...|$|E
60|$|At first Angela, {{not being}} {{accustomed}} to <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> of the sort, {{did not understand}} what his intentions were, {{but as soon as}} she did, being an extremely powerful young woman, she soon put a stop to them, shaking George away from her so sharply by a little swing of her lithe body, that, stumbling over a footstool in his rapid backward passage, he in a trice measured his length upon the floor. Seeing what she had done, Angela turned and fled after her father.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they all}} laughed {{again at the}} absurd idea of this great and good man preferring his food,--his food of this world,--to that other food which it was his special {{business}} to dispense. There is nothing which the Stumfoldian ladies of Littlebath liked so much as these <b>little</b> <b>jokes</b> which bordered on the profanity of the outer world, which made them feel themselves to be almost as funny as the sinners, and gave them a slight taste, as it were, of the pleasures of iniquity.|$|R
60|$|We had our supper in the priest's house, and a {{government}} official who had come down from Dublin, partly out {{of interest in this}} attempt 'to educate the people,' and partly because it was his holiday and it was necessary to go somewhere, entertained us with <b>little</b> <b>jokes.</b> Somebody, not I think a priest, talked of the spiritual destiny of our race and praised the night's work, for the play was refined and the people really very attentive, and he could not understand my discontent; but presently he was silenced by the patter of jokes.|$|R
