40|$|Theresearch {{focus on}} using the {{aeration}} process as means for water recarbonationafter <b>lime-soda</b> <b>softening.</b> The {{results indicated that}} aeration efficientfor  recarbonation of three water sampleswith different characteristics. The <b>lime-soda</b> <b>softening</b> increased the (pH) values of the three samples to  reach(10. 08, 10. 39, 10. 54) respectively. The aeration decreased these (pH) values to(8. 26, 8. 36, 8. 23) respectively within (60) minutes. The depression was related tothe convert of the hydroxide and carbonate of the sample to the bicarbonateform by CO 2 gas absorbed from the air bubbles. The absorptionefficiencies were (30. 9, 31. 0, 24. 7) % for the three samples respectively. Theresearch also determined the value of (pH) at which the softened sample issaturated with  calcium  carbonate. These values  for the  three  samples were (8. 30, 8. 39, 8. 44) respectively. Accordingly the Langer saturationindex for each sample have a positive value. The samples is at  supersaturation condition with calciumcarbonate for all samples. Therefore the aeration period needed to obtain thesaturation state at which the sample is stable was determined to be(58. 8, 59. 1, 55. 2) minutes for the three samples respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of silica scale {{is a problem}} for thermoelectric power generating facilities, and this study investigated the potential for removal of silica by means of chemical coagulation from source water before it is subjected to mineral concentration in cooling towers. In Phase I, a screening of many typical as well as novel coagulants was carried out using concentrated cooling tower water, with and without flocculation aids, at concentrations typical for water purification with limited results. In Phase II, it was decided that treatment of source or make up water was more appropriate, and that higher dosing with coagulants delivered promising results. In fact, the less exotic coagulants proved to be more efficacious for reasons not yet fully determined. Some analysis was made of the molecular nature of the precipitated floc, which may aid in process improvements. In Phase III, more detailed study of process conditions for aluminum chloride coagulation was undertaken. <b>Lime-soda</b> water <b>softening</b> and the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide were shown to be too limited in terms of effectiveness, speed, and energy consumption to be considered further for the present application. In Phase IV, sodium aluminate emerged as an effective coagulant for silica, and the most attractive of those tested to date because of its availability, ease of use, and low requirement for additional chemicals. Some process optimization was performed for coagulant concentration and operational pH. It is concluded that silica coagulation with simple aluminum-based agents is effective, simple, and compatible with other industrial processes...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the water {{requirements}} for cooling industrial manufacturing processes have changed dramatically. Once-through cooling {{has been largely}} replaced by open recirculating cooling water methods. This approach reduces water consumption by increasing the use of recycled water. Simplistically, the circulating cooling water flows through heat exchanger equipment and is cooled by passing through a cooling tower. The recycled water is cooled by evaporation {{of some of the}} circulating water as it passes through the tower. As a result of the evaporation process, the dissolved solids in the water become concentrated. The evaporated water is replaced by fresh makeup water. The dissolved solids content of the water is maintained by the rate of water discharge (blowdown). As the amount of dissolved solids increases, their solubility is exceeded and the solids tend to precipitate from the cooling water. The precipitated scale adheres to heat transfer surfaces and reduces heat transfer efficiency. In order to achieve zero discharge of water, it is paramount that the potential for scale formation and deposition be minimized. This can be accomplished through physical separation of scale-forming ions and particulate matter. Two widely used mechanical methods in this category are <b>lime-soda</b> side stream <b>softening</b> and vapor compression blowdown evaporation. Another approach is chemical treatment to promote scale inhibition and dispersion...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystallization}} kinetics for the precipitation {{of calcium}} carbonate and magnesium hydroxide {{in the presence of}} cadmium, lead, and zinc were studied. The kinetics for the precipitation have been studied in a continuous reactor operated under MSMPR (mixed suspension mixed product removal) conditions. Reactor residence times, effluent alkalinity conditions, and initial heavy metal concentrations (acting as impurity) were varied to determine these kinetics. The crystal size distribution was measured using the Coulter Counter Model TA II, allowing sizing of the crystals in the 6 to 75 micron size range. Steady state conditions in which the residual hardness, alkalinity distribution, and particle size distribution remains fairly constant after approximately 11 residence times, was observed. The MSMPR crystallizer analysis of the population balance provides an adequate description of the particle size distribution. ^ Residual calcium levels were varied in the presence of different types of heavy metals. Cadmium and zinc inhibit {{the precipitation of}} calcium carbonate resulting in a higher residual hardness level, about 50 - 85 mg/l as CaCO(, 3), while lead promotes the crystallization of calcium carbonate resulting in lower residual hardness level, about 25 - 50 mg/l as CaCO(, 3). The removal of magnesium hardness was not affected in the presence of cadmium, lead, or zinc. The predominant form of the calcium carbonate precipitated in this research was the calcite form, {{with a small amount of}} the aragonite formed. The percentage of aragonite crystals increased with the addition of magnesium hardness. ^ Heavy metals can be removed effectively in this operation. The removal efficiency exceeded 97. 0 % for cadmium and zinc for an initial concentration level of 5. 0 mg/l and removals exceeded 99. 0 % for lead with an initial concentration level of 1. 22 mg/l. The X-ray diffraction pattern data, the scanning electron microscope photographs, and the residual heavy metals concentration all suggest the major mechanisms involved for removal of heavy metals from solution in the <b>lime-soda</b> ash water <b>softening</b> process are: surface adsorption for cadmium and zinc removal, and isomorphic inclusion for lead removal. ^ A batch softening study was also performed which exhibited a different type of behavior as compared to those performed with the continuous MSMPR crystallization.
