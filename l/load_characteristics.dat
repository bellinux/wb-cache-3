Regardless of the ultimate destination of the solar power, though, the central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on both the amount of sunlight falling on the solar panels and the electrical <b>characteristics</b> of the <b>load.</b> As the amount of sunlight varies, the <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes, so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency.

50|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to a filter, and essential if the DC load requires very low ripple voltage, is to follow the reservoir capacitor with an active voltage regulator circuit. The reservoir capacitor must {{be large enough to}} prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and <b>load</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It would be possible to use a smaller reservoir capacitor (these can be large on high-current power supplies) and then apply some filtering as well as the regulator, {{but this is not a}} common strategy. The extreme of this approach is to dispense with the reservoir capacitor altogether and put the rectified waveform straight into a choke-input filter. The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother and consequently the rectifier no longer has to deal with the current as a large current pulse, but instead the current delivery is spread over the entire cycle. The disadvantage, apart from extra size and weight, is that the voltage output is much lower - approximately the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak.|$|E

The relation between matched structure and filter’s output characteristic is demonstrated and the design principle is introduced. The work above proved that even if the filters are designed for the same transfer function, so long as filter’s load resistance is different, their designed parameters are also different. Traditional power system filter seldom consider its both ends <b>load</b> matching <b>characteristic.</b> When the difference between filter's <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> and practical system equivalent impedance are large, the actual filtering effect becomes worse, current loss arises and even there may be the possibility of resonance.
