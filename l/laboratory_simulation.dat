[...] She spent four years combining <b>laboratory</b> <b>simulation</b> and astronomical observation to study the chemistry and dynamics of interstellar ice. This research led to a thesis, titled “Complex processes in simple ices: Laboratory and observational studies of gas-grain interactions during star formation.” Öberg presented the different chapters at conferences worldwide and several institutions in the United States. The doctoral thesis was defended on September 16, 2009. Besides conducting this research, Öberg supervised two M.Sc. projects and served as a teaching assistant for courses on Pulsars and research for undergraduate students. She graduated cum laude with a Ph.D. in Astronomy from Leiden University in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Carson {{described}} the Nexus energy ribbon {{as the true}} villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural analog. [...] "When creating something from scratch, it's always important to rough out the whole thing [...] {{because there are so}} many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down," [...] recalled effects co-superviosr Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the [...] from The Undiscovered Country. Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion <b>Laboratory</b> <b>simulation.</b> The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils. To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon.|$|E
