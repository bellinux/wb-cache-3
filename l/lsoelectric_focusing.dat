40|$|Six {{clinical}} isolates of Enterobacter cloacae {{isolated in}} a Portuguese hospital, between April 1999 and November 2000, demonstrated resistance to almost all broad-spectrum cephalosporins, except to cefepime. These isolates were susceptible to quinolones and to aminoglycosides. <b>lsoelectric</b> <b>focusing</b> demonstrated production of beta-lactamases with pIs 8. 0 {{and by all}} six isolates, exhibiting a cephalosporinase phenotype. The results of pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that these isolates were genetically unrelated. The amino acid sequence of six AmpC beta-lactamases (EclolFF, Eclo 6 FF, Eclo 9 FF, Eclo 1 OFF, Eclo 11 FF and Eclol 5 FF) shared 97 - 99 % homology with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase from E. cloacae P 99 and 86 - 87 % homology with those of two plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases, MIR- 1 and ACT- 1. This is the first report of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase production by E cloacae isolates in a Portuguese hospital. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Fruit removal for 5 {{weeks after}} {{flowering}} increased acid phosphatase activity 10 -fold in soybean (Glycine max 1. Merr. vai Hobbit) leaves compared with normal seed-pod-bearing plants. The major acid phosphatase activity in leaves was purified over 2700 -fold, yielding a single polypeptide of 51 kD {{with a specific}} activity of 1353 units/mg protein using p-nitrophenylphosphate as the substrate. <b>lsoelectric</b> <b>focusing</b> demonstrated that the purified protein co-migrated with {{a majority of the}} activity that increased in leaves following seed-pod removal. lmmunoblot analysis demonstrated that {{at least part of the}} increased activity was dueto an increased abundance of the phosphatase protein. In situ enzyme activity staining localized most of the total phosphatase activity to vascular tissues, the leaf paraveinal mesophyll cell layer, and the lower epidermis. This distribution and the response to seed-pod removal paralleled previous results for soybean vegetative storage protein (VSP) α and β. However, in a native polyacrylamide gel the VSP detected by immunological staining of electrophoretically transferred protein did not migrate with the majority of the phosphatase activity. Fractionation of crude leaf protein on concanavalin A-Sepharose yielded a fraction containing 97 % of the total VSP but only 0. 1 % of the total acid phosphatase activity...|$|E
