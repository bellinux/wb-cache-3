5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
