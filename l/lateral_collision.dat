The data from a real world experiment is used, where the adaptive real-time strategy CRONOS (ContRol Of Networks by Optimization of Switchovers) and a time-plan strategy with vehicle-actuated ranges alternately controlled an isolated intersection near Paris.

40|$|Derailments due to <b>lateral</b> <b>collisions</b> between heavy road {{vehicles}} and passenger trains at level crossings (LCs) are serious safety issues. A variety of countermeasures {{in terms of}} traffic laws, communication technology and warning devices are used for minimising LC accidents; however, innovative civil infrastructure solution is rare.

This model is capable of predicting the lateral collision-induced derailments with and without GRS. Based on dynamic simulations, derailment prevention mechanism of the GRS is illustrated.

Individual non-minor {{injuries}} (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) > or = 2) {{to the head}} that occurred to belted and unbelted drivers and front seat passengers on the stuck side of impacted vehicles were examined. Injury type, injury combination, collision severity in relation to type of injury as well as contact sources were assessed. Forty-eight percent of injuries were moderate in severity (AIS 2). The {{most common type of}} injury was the diffuse brain injury, typically marked by a short period of unconsciousness, which occurred in collisions of lower severity than focal brain and skull fracture injuries. One-hundred and five out of 216 (48. 6 %) of contact sources for all injury types originated from outside the vehicle and such exterior sources were more likely to result in high severity injuries. Thirty percent of injuries resulted from head contacts with other vehicles. The most frequent vehicle interior contact source was the side window glass. Diffuse injuries tended to occur independently of other injury types and were more likely to originate from an interior rather than exterior contact. Preventative measures for head injury reduction in <b>lateral</b> <b>collisions</b> are discussed. Overall, the data show that proposed and present European and U.

This report {{presents the results}} of an in-depth study of run-off-road crashes in the Dutch Province of Zeeland. In an in-depth study of road crashes all possible information is collected about all aspects of the crash: the traffic conditions, the immediate environment, the road users who are involved, their vehicles, and the injuries that have been sustained by the vehicle occupants. The purpose of the present research is to gain insight in the factors and circumstances that have an influence on the occurrence and the outcome of run-off-road crashes. This will provide a basis for the selection of measures that can prevent similar crashes in future or reduce the injury severity of these crashes. Run-off-road crashes are defined as crashes in which one of the motor vehicles that are involved runs off the road in the initial phase of the crash. The end position of the vehicle is not important; the vehicle may have come to a stop on the verge, in a ditch, against an obstacle or tree, but it may also have crashed into an approaching vehicle. Therefore, run-off-road crashes are not only single-vehicle crashes or obstacle crashes; they can also be frontal or <b>lateral</b> <b>collisions</b> provided that one of the involved vehicles ran off the road in the initial phase of the crash...|$|R

The relevant injury with associated mechanical parameter is to be considered for definition of the models. This will lead to detailed model specifications which will integrate the prescript mechanical parameters into each segment models with high bio-fidelity.

This research focuses on feasible trajectory generation and development of an automatic obstacle avoidance controller that integrates steering and braking action. A controller is developed to cause a specially modified car (a Mercedes `S' class with steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire capability) to perform an ISO 3888 - 2 emergency obstacle avoidance manoeuvre. A nonlinear two-track vehicle model is developed and used to derive optimal controller parameters using a series of simulations. Feedforward and feedback control is used to track a feasible reference trajectory. The feedforward control loops use inverse models of the vehicle dynamics. The feedback control loops are implemented as linear proportional controllers with a force allocation matrix used to apportion braking effort between redundant actuators. Two trajectory generation routines are developed: a geometric method, for steering a vehicle at its physical limits; and an optimal method, which integrates steering and braking action to make full use of available traction. The optimal trajectory is obtained using a multi-stage convex optimisation procedure. The overall controller performance is validated by simulation using a complex proprietary model of the vehicle that is reported to have been validated and calibrated against experimental data over several years of use in an industrial environment...|$|E

Regarding the first problem, a novel application of reachability analysis allowed controller synthesis in a single step to achieve (a) safety, (b) stability, and (c) prevent input saturation. By extending the state to include the input parameters, constraints for stability, saturation, and envelope protection are incorporated into a single reachability analysis. Regarding the second problem, a new approach to the problem of recovery provides (a) states from which recovery is possible, and (b) controllers to guide the system during a recovery maneuver from an error state to a safe state in minimal time.

This paper shows {{the results of}} user needs assessment and traffic safety modelling of VisionSense. User needs were determined by means of a Web-based survey. The results show, that VisionSense is most appreciated when it uses a light signal to warn the driver in a possibly hazardous situation on a highway. The willingness to pay is estimated at 300 Euros. Another conclusion based on the survey is that frequent car users want less assistance than less frequent drivers. Besides the user needs the impact on traffic safety is modelled. The results are indicative and more research has to be done. Traffic safety effects of VisionSense on a highway were modelled by means of a microscopic car following and lane change algorithm. Twelve different traffic scenarios were modelled with and without VisionSense. With VisionSense no traffic conflicts occur due to lane changing and less lane changes are performed.

40|$|The {{relation}} between Road Protection Scores (RPS) and the casualty rate at road sections {{in the province}} of Utrecht. The European cooperative EuroRAP has developed a method to systematically estimate {{the extent to which the}} road design and layout offer protection to vehicle occupants. The protection level is expressed in the Road Protection Score (RPS) : a number of stars with a maximum of four. This study has investigated whether this is a valid method for the provincial roads {{in the province of}} Utrecht. In other words: whether a relation can be established between the number of stars that road sections have been given according to the RPS method and the casualty rates at those road sections for occupants of motorized vehicles. The RPS method which has been evaluated in this study only assesses those road features that reduce the severity of the consequences of car crashes; this is RPS method 1. 0. The latest version of the RPS method (version 2. 0) also assesses the road features that prevent the occurrence of crashes. The RPS method version 1. 0 has been used to award stars to provincial roads in the province of Utrecht for the roadside of each road section, for the separation of driving directions of each road section, and for the intersection that was possibly present on a road section. These individual assessments have been used to calculate an overall assessment to each road section. This task, commissioned by the Royal Dutch Touring Club ANWB, was carried out by the consultancy firm Mobycon who used a EuroRAP software programme. First, a small literature review was carried out on the {{relation between}} the RPS and the casualty rate in other countries. Next, SWOV calculated the casualty rate per road section of provincial roads in the province of Utrecht. The casualty rate was defined as: the number of fatalities and inpatients per million motor vehicle kilometres among the occupants of motorized vehicles. The casualty rate could be calculated using numbers of casualties, length of the road sections, and estimates of the traffic volume per road section. These last estimates were supplied by the road authority. To calculate the casualty rate data from the period 2005 - 2007 was used of roadside crashes, head-on <b>collisions</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>collisions</b> at intersections in which occupants of motorized vehicles were killed or sustained such severe injury that they had to be admitted to hospital. Not only for road sections, but also for entire roads, provincial roads with a certain N-number, a possible relation between the number of stars and the casualty rate was investigated. Finally, it was investigated whether crashes on road sections with a high number of stars had less serious consequences for occupants of motorize vehicles than crashes on road sections with fewer stars...|$|R

Friend & Nutman 2005). Popular jargon de-scribes these as terranes, bounded by faults or mylonite zones and characterised by rocks of contrasting origin {{on either side of}} their tectonic boundaries (Coney et al. 1980). The Isukasia and Færingehavn terranes (Figs 1, 2) are the oldest terranes at ≥ 3. 75 Ga, and extend from the outer part of Godthåbsfjord in the south-west to the margin of the Inland Ice in th...|$|R
40|$|The Ivisârtoq greenstone belt is {{situated}} 40 km {{south of the}} Isua greenstone belt within the Godthåbsfjord region of southwest Greenland. This region {{is part of the}} Archean gneiss complex of Greenland, a major component of the 3800 - 2500 Ma North Atlantic Craton. Compared to the Isua greenstone belt, which {{has been the focus of}} intense study because it contains some of the oldest known (3. 8 - 3. 7 Ga) rocks on Earth, little work has been carried out on the Ivisârtoq greenstone belt. The Ivisârtoq greenstone belt is exceptionally well-exposed in three dimensions with relief of 1200 m, and primary features are better preserved here than in any other Archean greenstone belt in Greenland. Consequently, this belt provides an exceptionally good opportunity to characterise early to middle Archean magmatism, deformational processes, and tectonic environments. [...] The Ivisârtoq greenstone belt was multiply deformed and metamorphosed at amphibolite facies. The belt forms an upright southwest-closing, V-shaped synform. This study concentrated on the 3 km thick southern limb of the synform, where the most complete section of the supracrustal rocks is preserved, and where there are pillow lava structures with way-up indicators. The southern limb was found to comprise a tectonostratigraphy made up of two main components, termed the northern and southern parts. These composite rock units differ in composition and intensity of deformation and are separated by a major high strain zone. [...] The northern part of the belt is generally less deformed than the southern part and is characterized by heterogeneously deformed amphibolite, derived from variolitic and homogeneous basaltic pillow lavas, interlayered with boudins of olivine-bearing ultramafic rocks and quartz-feldspar-mica gneiss and schist. The southern part consists predominantly of strongly deformed rocks including banded amphibolite, homogeneous granitoid, gabbroic rocks, and a thick layer of predominantly quartz-feldspar-biotite- schist. [...] New major and trace element geochemical data, LAM ICP-MS U-Pb zircon geochronology, and field mapping have shed new light on the origin and evolution of the Ivisârtoq greenstone belt. This new work indicates that the northern and southern parts of the belt represent discrete packages of rocks that formed in different environments and were juxtaposed after - 2895 Ma, after the main volcanism associated with each part had ceased. Each package of rocks suffered separate deformational events before juxtaposition: two discrete deformational phases were recognized in the less deformed northern part, whereas the southern part was much more intensely deformed and individual events could not be differentiated. [...] Crustal contamination signatures of the amphibolites in the northern part of the belt suggest formation in a back-arc basin environment, in which the basaltic magma ascended through thin, patchy or immature crust. A U-Pb zircon age of an intrusive tonalite sheet demonstrates that the northern basaltic pillow lavas were deposited before - 3165 Ma. [...] In contrast, the southern part of the belt appears to have formed on a thick continental crust. This interpretation is based on several lines of evidence: crustal contamination signatures of the banded amphibolite, the presence of a thick sequence of quartzofeldspathic metasedimentary rocks, an A-type granitoid, and a horizon of metamorphosed meymechite, which is indicative of deep melting of subcontinental mantle. A maximum age of- 2895 Ma was determined for the deposition of the southern metasedimentary rocks. [...] The interpreted juxtaposition of the northern and southern packages of the Ivisârtoq belt is consistent with <b>lateral</b> <b>collisions</b> of terranes perhaps by plate tectonic processes. ...|$|R
