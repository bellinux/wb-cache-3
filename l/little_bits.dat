He'd made some token appearances in the past—most notably in season one's 'Call of the Simpsons'—but 'Dead Putting Society' much more clearly defined the Ned we'd come to know and love. It also featured scads of good <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> and gags and seemed like a solid program." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that apart from [...] "the memorable lawn mowing sequence at the end, this episode is notable for our first viewing of the gaudy, gadget-filled, God-fearing splendour that is the Flanderses' home." ...|$|E

[...] In this way, one of the ideas they connected was the universality of long-distance relationships, the pain and heartache of which they were able to incorporate in [...] "Miles Away".

Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads of these <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue.

500|$|On November 10, 2003, Beyoncé {{performed}} at the Wembley Arena in London; this was later put on a DVD, titled Live at Wembley, which was released in April 2004. It {{was accompanied by a}} CD comprising three previously-unreleased studio recorded songs and one remix each of [...] "Crazy in Love", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl". Behind-the-scenes footage can be also seen on the DVD. The album debuted at number seventeen on the Billboard 200, selling 45,000 copies in its first week. The DVD has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping 200,000 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it had sold 264,000 copies in the US by October 2007, while as at October 6, 2010, it had sold 197,000 digital downloads.

500|$|Website AllMusic graded {{the album}} with three-and-a-half stars out of five.

500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over.

[...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Cooper reprised {{his role}} as Phil Wenneck {{in the third and}} final {{installment}} of The Hangover trilogy, The Hangover Part III, which was poorly reviewed by critics. A reviewer for The Independent argued that Cooper is [...] "reduced to mugging for the camera, offering reaction shots to nothing." [...] Nevertheless, like its preceding entries, the film was a commercial success, grossing $362 million worldwide, and remains one of Cooper's highest-grossing releases. Later that year, he took on the supporting role of an unhinged FBI agent in David O. Russell's crime comedy-drama American Hustle. Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. It also starred Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. American Hustle was a critical and commercial success with global revenues of $251.1 million. Kim Newman of Empire wrote: [...] "Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of business to hold the attention", praising his [...] "spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss." [...] Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, but did not win any.|$|E

500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{location}} {{shooting was}} mostly completed at Zaccariello's Sabaudia beach {{house and its}} outlying property.

Betti recalled, [...] "All of this had to occur in a forest. But where was it? Bava said, 'Don't worry. I will do the forest.' And he found a florist who was selling these little stupid branches with <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of foliage on them, and he began to make them dance in front of the camera!

2500|$|Epicurus's teachings {{represented}} {{a departure from}} the other major Greek thinkers of his period, and before, but was nevertheless founded on many of the same principles as Democritus. Like Democritus, he was an atomist, believing that the fundamental constituents of the world were indivisible <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of matter (atoms; Greek: ἄτομος atom os, [...] "indivisible") flying through empty space (Greek: κενόν kenon). Everything that occurs {{is the result of the}} atoms colliding, rebounding, and becoming entangled with one another.

This allowed him to avoid the determinism implicit in the earlier atomism and to affirm free will.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{proteins}} have {{folded and}} {{are ready to}} be transported out of the ER {{it is thought that}} they assemble at specific site within the ER called [...] "ER exit sites". These sites can be transient but are most likely situated in the ER where the ER is close to the next transport compartment, the vesicular-tubular cluster (VTC) (also referred to as the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC)). The details of how proteins are concentrated or localized to the exit site is unclear (some aspects are emerging!) but the actual process of budding a vesicle containing these proteins start with a protein called Sec12. This protein recruits a small GTPase called Sar1 (think of Sar1 as a switch, it is active when bound to GTP and inactive when it hydrolyses the GTP to GDP). This in turn leads to the recruitment of a protein complex, the Sec23/Sec24 and the Sec13/Sec31 complex (also known as the COPII coat). In a nutshell what these proteins do is form a mesh at the ER exit site and the mesh through mechanical curvature forms a little [...] "blob" [...] that pinches off from the ER with proteins inside (think, playdough as the ER and your hand as the Sec complex pinching off <b>little</b> <b>bits).</b> The mesh disassembles off the budded vesicle when Sar1 hydrolyses the GTP to GDP. Interestingly, this activity of Sar1 is enhanced by Sec23/24.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the annual}} Saturday Book {{recorded}} in 1956 {{a view that}} [...] "London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of girls in jeans", the [...] "Edwardian" [...] ("teddy boy") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, {{the legacy of the}} [...] "New Look" [...] was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, [...] "photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late". The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and espresso bars of Soho and Fitzrovia. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; {{in the words of one}} social historian, “thousands of pale, duffel-coat-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”. Various public houses and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the Colony Room Club in Soho, opened in 1948 by Muriel Belcher, a lesbian from Birmingham. As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called [...] "Angry Young Men" [...] from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer Alma Cogan wished to mark her success by buying mink coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and [...] "a sort of a beatnik". In 1960 the future author Jacqueline Wilson, who, as a teenager, lived in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a record shop [...] "in turquoise duffle coats, extremely tight jeans and cha-cha shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys".|$|E
