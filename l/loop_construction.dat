This proposal was considered at the time of <b>Loop</b> <b>construction,</b> but was ruled out for cost reasons. With the increase in passenger numbers since then, the trams currently servicing this area suffer severe overcrowding at peak times and the call for a Loop expansion has been raised again. The Victorian State Government announced in December 2008, as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, that it would commence planning for a new underground rail tunnel linking suburban lines from the north western suburbs to the south east, with new stations at Melbourne University and the Kings Domain (St Kilda Road), and interchanges with the existing city loop and other suburban routes at Melbourne Central and Flinders Street.|$|E

A 2012 proposal for the reorganization of surface traffic after the completion of the [...] "Pisara" [...] connection included an extension of line 1 to the Käpylä station, but for a different reason. The Helsinki City Rail Loop is an underground loop of the commuter railway network that would distribute passengers to three new underground stations in central Helsinki. The proposal for after the city rail <b>loop</b> <b>construction</b> for surface traffic includes a new bus terminal at Käpylä. Bus lines that currently continue to the city centre would terminate at the Käpylä station, where the passengers could make a connection to commuter trains or an extended tram line 1.|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{analogous}} construction for topological spaces without basepoint.

In this paper, we consider its bigraph version. A bigraph is a graph equipped with its 2 -coloring. We introduce the <b>loop</b> space <b>construction</b> Ω_/K_ 2 (X,x) of a based bigraph (X,x). This is a graph such that C(Ω_/K_ 2 (X,x)) is homotopy equivalent to the loop space of the box complex B_/K_ 2 (X) of the bigraph.

The "momenta" and "velocity" from the earlier paper, which were proven to be cobordant loops in 6 D; are used as the new loop variables. In the process, the Hamiltonian, Diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints are written in polynomials of these loop variables. Other constraints such as the "Q" constraint and simplicity constraints arise due to greater degrees of freedom. We then undergo the Master Constraint treatment to resolve the constraints. Then, a pre-quantum version of the theory is examined; and the properties of the Grassmannian of the Hilbert Space are explored. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
40|$|A {{discipline}} for <b>loop</b> <b>construction</b> {{is presented}} {{which is based}} on the concept of a well-formed postcondition. A well-formed postcondition is seen to have an implicit logical structure which is made explicit by appropriate. variable binding. This variable binding identifies the loop invariant and a determinate. Loops are then constructed by first identifying the weakest iterative mechanism capable of establishing the postcondition. Subsequent development proceeds by way of inducive stepwise refinement. This discipline for <b>loop</b> <b>construction</b> leads naturally to a scheme for classifying loop mechanisms. It also leads to a proposal for a weak loop grammar (not in principle unlike Chomsky 2 ̆ 7 s phrase structure grammar) which helps to make explicit semantically important components of a loop structure.
