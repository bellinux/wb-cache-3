5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately {{compromised by}} <b>loosening</b> suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the number}} of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters {{in the western part of}} the state ended up voting against it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{marked the}} last {{deployment}} of the Yugoslav Navy {{into one of the}} Dalmatian channels, the <b>loosening</b> of the naval blockade of the Croatian coast imposed in September and the largest Croatian Navy operation in the war. The Croatian Navy later towed the grounded Mukos to Šibenik, repaired the vessel and put her into service as OB-62 Šolta. During the battle, 22 Yugoslav Navy crewmen, two Croatian gunners and two civilian sailors in Split were killed. Thirty-three Yugoslav officers were charged in relation to the naval bombardment by Croatian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of <b>loosening</b> his grip.|$|E

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by <b>loosening</b> the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and <b>loosening</b> of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E
5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began <b>loosening</b> up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{blasting}} is an {{abrasive blasting}} method, {{also referred to}} as dustless blasting or closed loop abrasive blasting. The method is characterized by a blast tool that does abrasive blasting and collects both used blast media, and <b>loosened</b> particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. The blast tool is equipped with a blast hose and a suction hose, that both run from the blast tool to a control unit. The control unit supplies the blast tool with pressurized air mixed with blast media, and sucks back dust, <b>loosened</b> particles and used blast media. The control unit continuously separates dust and <b>loosened</b> particles from the used blast media, and sends used blast media back into the pressurized air flow. The dust and <b>loosened</b> particles are collected in a waste bin.|$|R

5|$|In {{seeking the}} 51st House {{district}} state house seat, representing Loveland, Marostica first faced a challenge from Kevan McNaught in the Republican primary. McNaught {{was endorsed by}} the Colorado Club for Growth, who criticized Marostica for his support of higher taxes and his use of eminent domain {{when he was a}} member the Loveland city council. Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both {{the left and the right}} to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a <b>loosening</b> of state spending restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), <b>loosening</b> and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a <b>loosening</b> of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 2014, {{there was}} {{increasing}} {{speculation that the}} Sōryū class (or a derivative) was the most likely candidate for the replacement. Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the <b>loosening</b> of Japanese defence export restrictions, were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by <b>loosening</b> it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the <b>loosening</b> of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E

5000|$|CR-3 went offline in September 2009 for RFO-16. While {{the reactor}} was down, the old steam {{generators}} {{were to be}} replaced. There are 426 steel tendons within the concrete walls of the reactor containment dome which reinforce the dome. Plan developer Sargent & Lundy specified that 97 tendons be <b>loosened.</b> Progress rejected that number as excessive. The next proposal was to <b>loosen</b> 74 tendons, which was typical of other nuclear plants doing the procedure. According to a Progress employee, [...] "de-tensioning the tendons is a very expensive and time-consuming effort", so the number was further reduced to 65. Progress engaged Bechtel to provide a 3rd party review, which agreed that 65 was appropriate. However, when the work was performed, only 27 tendons were <b>loosened,</b> and a foreman and supervisor sent emails questioning the way the tendons were <b>loosened.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the <b>loosening</b> of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the <b>loosening</b> of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E
5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual <b>loosening</b> of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E
