25|$|Because the ENIAC was a {{classified}} project, the programmers {{were not at}} first allowed into the room to see the machine, but they were given access to blueprints from which to work out programs in an adjacent room. Programming the ENIAC involved discretising the differential equations involved in a trajectory problem to the precision allowed by the ENIAC and calculating the route to the appropriate bank of electronics in parallel progression, with each instruction having to reach the correct <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to within 1/5,000th of a second. Having devised a program on paper, the women were allowed into the ENIAC room to physically program the machine.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

500|$|The Military Landing Officer, Major J. R. Broadbent {{landed with}} the first wave in the same LCP(R) as Pike. With him was an Amphibian Scout {{carrying}} the red signal light that was to mark {{the centre of the}} beach for later waves. They were unable to reach the correct <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> for the second wave, but were able to place it and switch it on in time for the third, so it was the first to land on Scarlet Beach. Although the first wave had landed seven minutes late, the second was fifteen, and the third was half an hour behind schedule. In the confusion, two LCIs collided, killing two soldiers and injuring eight. [...] Some of the LCI captains were reluctant to drive their ships in hard enough, and many troops disembarked into water that was over their heads. Sergeant Iaking Iwagu, of the Royal Papuan Constabulary, landing with 9 Platoon of the Papuan Infantry Battalion, was awarded the George Medal for attempting to save Captain A. B. Luetchford, who was hit in deep water. The third wave found the Japanese bunkers still manned, and assaulted them. Most of the Japanese defenders withdrew rather than fight to the finish.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century {{archaeology}} {{was often}} a supplement to history, and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their typology and stratigraphy, thus marking their <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space. Franz Boas established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist V. Gordon Childe and American archaeologist W. C. McKern independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking {{about the people who}} produced it— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods. [...] Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model: ...|$|E

2500|$|That is, {{material}} artifacts {{were the}} material residue of culture, but not culture itself. [...] Taylor's {{point was that}} the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people. [...] Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented. [...] One reason was that his three-tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical. [...] Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the time}} of Colnett's first voyage two other British ships, owned by John Meares and his partners, were trading on the North West coast. Meares had chosen not to pay for {{licenses}} from the East India Company and South Sea Company, instead striving to conceal the ship's illegal conduct by using the Portuguese flag. During the winter of 1788-89 the owners of all four vessels decided to form a joint venture {{under the protection of}} the licenses, although the South Sea Company license applied only to the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal. The joint venture had no firm name; Meares called it variously [...] "The Associated Merchants of London and India" [...] or [...] "The United Company of British Merchants Trading to the North West Coast of America". Colnett called it [...] "The South Sea Company of London". It was loosely referred to as [...] "this united Company". In early 1789 Colnett was given command of the joint undertaking as a whole. He was made captain of the Argonaut and given command over its tender, the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson. The goal of the joint venture was not just to send vessels to the North West coast but also to set up a permanent trading post at Nootka Sound, to be named Fort Pitt. Meares claimed he had purchased land there from Chief Maquinna of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people. The post could be built on Meares's land. Later, the question of whether Meares had actually acquired land from Maquinna become an issue of contention. Even if he had there were unresolvable questions about the amount of land purchased and its <b>location.</b> <b>In</b> <b>time</b> Chief Maquinna denied that any such purchase had been made, saying instead that the Spanish had the only rightful claim to land at Nootka Sound. Meares, one of the primary forces behind the venture, hoped that a permanent post at Nootka Sound would establish his own dominance in the lucrative marine fur trade. However, before the British ships arrived Spanish forces had already occupied the harbour and established their own fort. By the time Colnett's Argonaut arrived at Nootka Sound, {{the first phase of the}} crisis had already begun. The Spanish had taken control of the port and seized Captain Douglas and his ship.|$|E
6000|$|Martin began, that morning, a story {{which he}} had sketched {{out a number of}} weeks before and which ever since had been {{worrying}} him with its insistent clamor to be created. Apparently {{it was to be a}} rattling sea story, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real characters, in a real world, under real conditions. But beneath the swing and go of the story was to be something else--something that the superficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand, would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a reader. It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to write it. For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif that suggested plots to him. After having found such a motif, he cast about for the particular persons and particular <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing. [...] "Overdue" [...] was the title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not be more than sixty thousand words--a bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of production. On this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools. He no longer worried for fear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work. The long months of intense application and study had brought their reward. He could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life. [...] "Overdue" [...] would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events; but it would tell, too, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of all time, and all sea, and all life--thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought, leaning back for a moment from the table. Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in his hands.|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} of the {{development}} of temporal concepts is described that assumes that there are substantial changes in how children think about <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the early years. It is argued that there is a shift from understanding <b>time</b> <b>in</b> an event-dependent way to an event-independent understanding of <b>time.</b> Early <b>in</b> development, very young children are unable to think about <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> independently of the events that occur at those locations. It is only with development that children begin to have a proper grasp of the distinction between past, present, and future, and represent time as linear and unidirectional. The model assumes that although children aged 2 to 3 years may categorize events differently depending on whether they lie in the past or the future, {{they may not be able}} to understand that whether an event is in the past or future is something that changes as time passes and varies with temporal perspective. Around 4 to 5 years, children understand how causality operates <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> and can grasp the systematic relations that obtain between different <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> which provides the basis for acquiring the conventional clock and calendar system...|$|R
