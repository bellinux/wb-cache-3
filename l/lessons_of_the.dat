Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end.

5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that {{is a combination of}} various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough.

After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E

5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904.

Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Japanese War. For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive strategy would leave all British forces tied down defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them tied down at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on a tightrope. His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had to apply a certain level of destructive power to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was {{stepped up and}} innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in {{the introduction of the}} Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the lessons the U. S Army drew {{from the war}} in Vietnam and how these lessons influence current Army attitudes toward peace operations. The thesis finds that the Army's failure in Vietnam contributes not only to the Army's aversion toward peace operations, but also to its reluctance to participate in any limited war. It posits that culture has explanatory power in describing the Army's attitudes and policies toward peace operations. The thesis examines <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam, especially <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'never-again' school by surveying the articles written in Army, Military Review and Parameters about Vietnam and peace operations between 1972 and 1995. The thesis describes the Army's confusion over <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> Vietnam in <b>the</b> 197 Os, shows the Army's building a consensus around certain <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam in <b>the</b> l 98 Os and examines application <b>of</b> these <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> to peace operations in the 199 Os. Two events were influential in shaping <b>the</b> Army's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam: <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, On Strategy, in 1982 and a speech given in 1984 by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Harry Summers's book on America's failure in Vietnam and Secretary Weinberger's speech on pre-conditions for U. S. military intervention codified <b>the</b> Army's accepted <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam. These two events codified <b>the</b> many <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam into <b>The</b> <b>Lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam. <b>The</b> thesis concludes by focusing on how <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam influence <b>the</b> Army's attitude toward peace operations attitudes and influenced its policy. It first describes how Operation Desert Storm curtailed <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competing LIC subculture. Second, the thesis illustrates <b>the</b> hesitant attitudes <b>of</b> authors writing in the periodicals and the Army's reluctance to embrace peace operations.
