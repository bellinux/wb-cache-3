5|$|The name Anita was retired {{following}} this storm, {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic hurricane again. Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact. Additionally, officials permitted full use of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid. Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm. In Texas, the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> led to a mosquito outbreak near Galveston following the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area {{to the west of}} the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland.</b> In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
25|$|Heligoland's rock is {{significantly}} {{harder than the}} postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines {{to the east of}} the island. This is why the core of the island, which a thousand years ago was still surrounded by a large, <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> and sand dunes separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North Sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Heligoland's sand dunes remains—the sand isle just across the harbour called Düne (Dune). A referendum in June 2011 dismissed a proposal to reconnect the main island to the Düne islet with a landfill.|$|E

50|$|The {{management}} of this development company {{was assigned to}} Edgeworth Smith, a New York realtor. The Island Park-Long Beach Corporation started work by dredging the Island Park Canal and the Island Park Bay to provide soil {{to fill in the}} <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshlands.</b> A giant dredge pumped in mud five feet deep. After the mud dried, the island resembled a large, desolate desert.|$|R
50|$|By May, the Soviet {{offensive}} {{to break into}} Romanian territory towards the cities of Jassy and Kishinev had bogged down along the Dniestr River. Units of 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts had seized bridgeheads at several points in April, but they were shallow, marshy, and, in some cases, untenable against serious attack. While in 5th Shock Army, the 320th had crossed the river at Chebruchi, southeast of Tiraspol. Due to several reorganizations, the division was now in 37th Rifle Corps of 46th Army on May 12, holding a bridgehead between 1 - 2km deep and 3km wide in <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshlands,</b> with the Germans in possession of the high ground. Major General Ilia Shvygin had been {{in command of the}} 320th since July 30, 1943.|$|R
2500|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{consists}} mainly of London Clay (which covers most of North Kent). [...] Much of the centre {{of the town}} is built on <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland.</b> Sea walls are in place to prevent coastal flooding. The land in the east is higher, with slopes down to the coast at Tankerton. The whole of the north-east Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

50|$|The area {{rises from}} <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> along the Lea to over 90 feet at Whipps Cross on the {{southern}} edge of Epping Forest. Leyton is partially bisected by the A12 (M11 link road), with most of the district lying on the north-west side of this busy traffic artery through east London.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to casurinas, numerous {{other species of}} tree, bush, shrub, cacti, palm, and other grasses have been introduced, with many of them proving to be invasive species. Despite the decimation of the cedar, {{those parts of the}} island not covered in buildings and tarmac are now densely covered in trees and shrubbery, including allspice (Pimenta dioica [...] ), fiddlewood, Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla), bay grape (Coccoloba uvifera), Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora), poinciana (Delonix regia), fan palms, coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), royal palm (Roystonea), pittusporum, Natal plum, loquat (Eriobotrya japonica), oleander (Nerium oleander), and hibiscus. Most of the introduced species have proved to be unequal to Bermuda's frequently fierce weather. A succession of winter storms and a few powerful hurricanes that have struck {{over the last two decades}} have reduced woodlands, and available nest sites for small birds. The number of large trees, particularly, has been reduced. Although cedars are adapted to the local climate, and not so affected by stormy weather, rising sea levels are beginning to inundate the roots of old-growth cedars near <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshlands,</b> causing many to die.|$|R
40|$|This study details {{occurrences of}} Teredolites ichnocoenoses from modern bay-margin {{settings}} in Willapa Bay, Wash-ington. In particular, the paper scrutinizes in situ log-grounds from two intertidal zones situated immediately seaward of <b>low-lying,</b> supratidal, forested <b>marshlands</b> that are fed by small streams. Vestiges of remnant marshes and streams are preserved on intertidal flats as in-situ roots, broken stumps, strewn logs, abundant organic detritus, and organic sandy mud. Xylic material and organic sedi-ment were {{deposited in the}} supratidal marshes: tide and wave processes truncated the swamps, exposing in situ tree-root networks and the lowermost supratidal sediments. Stream and swamp deposits overlie and incise older Pleis-tocene strata. Both units are overlain by discontinuous, modern intertidal deposits. The intertidally exposed stumps and logs support a di-verse community of animal and plant life. Boring organ-isms, encrusters, and refugium seekers are found on and within the xylic substrates. Some encrusting animals {{and all of the}} boring fauna produce traces that are comparable to ichnofossils reported by palichnologists. Wood-boring traces reported in this study are similar morphologically to the ichnogenera Caulostrepsis, Entobia, Meandropolydo-ra, Psilonichnus, Rogerella, Teredolites, Thalassinoides, and Trypanites. Most of these ichnogenera have not been re-ported from rock-record examples of the Teredolites ichno-facies. The stratigraphic and environmental significance of the reported (modern) locales is consistent with previous stud-ies that associate Teredolites ichnofacies with base-level rise in marginal-marine environments. At Willapa Bay, bored xylic media form a coeval surface with adjacent, bur-rowed firmgrounds as well as softgrounds...|$|R
5000|$|The street {{had been}} planned as an {{experiment}} in sanitary and moral engineering. In deciding {{the route of the}} street, the planner James Pennethorne's objective [...] "has only been to ascertain how best to improve the condition of the inhabitants of Westminster by improving the buildings, the levels, and the sewers, and by opening communications through the most crowded parts." [...] The street was several feet above the <b>low-lying,</b> badly drained <b>marshland</b> between Westminster and the western part: what became Belgravia. In medieval times it was known as Thorney Island and thus some of its edges were not drained being in the Tyburn marsh itself. In 1850 considerable parts of Westminster were under the high-water mark of the Thames, and Victoria Street was designed to drain the area and clear the slums. Such developments were termed [...] "town swamps and social bridges" [...] by George Godwin. Pennethorne designed the street with a slight angle so that it would route through the Devil's Acre. The slum inhabitants were displaced by the Victoria Street developments, as the quantity of low-rent houses in the area declined and they were unable to afford the rents of the newly constructed flats. John Hollingshead reported at the time that Victoria Street had divided [...] "the diseased heart" [...] in half, pushing inhabitants into the surrounding areas. The Bishop of London informed the House of Lords that Victoria Street had displaced 5,000 people, 75 per cent of whom moved into already overcrowded areas south of the Thames, with the remaining people staying in declining low-rent accommodation in Westminster. New blocks of flats were constructed along Victoria Street and, according to Hollingshead, [...] "While the nighmare street of unlet places was waiting for more capital to fill its yawning gulf, and a few more residents to warm its hollow chambers into life, the landlords of the slums were raising their rents: and thieves, prostitutes, labourers, and working women were packing in a smaller compas." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{airfield}} {{consisted of}} a grass landing field, slightly below sea level, criss-crossed by ditches covered with boards. 121 acre site, 1200 x 1000 yards of <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> below mean tide level, bordered by the River Darent to the west, the Thames to the north, the taverns access road [...] "Joyce Green Lane" [...] (running north to south) to the east, and {{the grounds of the}} Joyce Green Hospitals to the south.|$|E
50|$|The Wold Newton turnpike, {{the only}} turnpike out of Grimsby, {{provided}} a route across the <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> surrounding Grimsby up {{on to the}} dry lands of the Wolds, ending at Wold Newton church. From Wold Newton, the traveller {{had to resort to}} the existing unimproved roads. There were toll gates at Brigsley Beck, where the toll house still stands {{on the north side of}} the road on the west side of the beck. An iron milestone still stands on the side of the road, two furlongs from the end of the road in Wold Newton.|$|E

50|$|Bashundhara Residential Area (বাড্ডা) is a Private {{residential}} area of Badda Thana in Dhaka District in the Division of Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is {{owned and operated}} by Bashundhara Group. The Project was started in the 1980s. In 2011 portions of the housing project was declared illegal as they were considerable flood flow zones of Dhaka. In 2014 a cabinet committee changed the Dhaka detailed plan to make the project legal. The project was built on area made by filling <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> and flood flow zones. The project has sold over 10,000 residential plots as of 2005.|$|E
50|$|Newtown Bay is a bay on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Isle of Wight, England in the western arm of the Solent. It is a subtle bay located around the exit of the Newtown River. It {{stretches}} about 4 km from Hamstead Point {{in the west to}} Salt Mead Ledge to the east. It is a remote place as there are few properties along this part of the coast, it being <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> and home to countless sea birds. The shore is a narrow band of gravel, while the sea bottom is mostly mud or sand.|$|E

50|$|Crowle is {{situated}} {{on one of}} a series of hills which form the Isle of Axholme, left exposed when the area emerged from the Glacial Lake Humber after the last Ice Age, and is separated from the main raised area to the south by a low-lying strip of land. The Isle of Axholme was formerly surrounded by several rivers, and much of the <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> was regularly inundated by water. The River Don flowed in a north-easterly direction just to the west of Crowle, to join the River Trent at Adlingfleet, but the hydrology of the area was radically altered in the seventeenth century, when Cornelius Vermuyden was appointed by Charles I to drain Hatfield Chase. Major rivers were diverted, and the numerous canals and drainage ditches that cross the fields give the whole area a Dutch character.|$|E
50|$|Forest Highway 35 (FFH-35) is a Federal Forest Highway located entirely within Chugach National Forest. The {{highway is}} {{approximately}} 6.6 mi long, and is mostly designated along the Portage Glacier Highway. The road serves the Portage Glacier {{branch of the}} park. FFH-35 begins at an intersection with the Seward Highway (AK-1) in Portage. The route follows the Portage Glacier Highway for approximately 5 mi, passing several park campgrounds and scenic turnouts. FFH 35 turns off the Portage Glacier Highway onto Portage Lake Loop Road, passing west of the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center Complex. The designation then shifts from Portage Lake Loop Road to Byron Glacier Road, which proceeds southward past <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> along Portage Lake. It continues past a small turnout area and travels over a small creek before proceeding eastward to its eastern terminus, a building and parking lot that make up part of the visitor center.|$|E

5000|$|The {{centre of}} the island is flat with a height of 41 m, and there are hummocks on its north, south and west ends. The island is covered mainly with stunted trees, but also has open scrub land and some <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland.</b> The island's major {{geographic}} features include three large bays, the largest of which is Henrietta Bay, in the southwest, named for the brig [...] "Elizabeth Henrietta" [...] which ran aground there in February 1824. The other bays are Lagoon Bay (in the west) and Caroline Bay (in the north west). The small Waitokariro Lagoon lies immediately inland from Henrietta Bay. The three bays are separated by two large peninsulas, and two more peninsulas extend at {{the northern and southern}} ends of the island, culminating in North Head and South Head respectively. One of these peninsulas, that between Lagoon and Caroline Bays, is a tombolo. North Head is a cliffy promontory rising to a hummock, 62 m high. Close to the westernmost point, on the peninsula separating Lagoon Bay and Henrietta Bay, the island reaches its highest point, 64 m above sea level. It is these two hummocks which give the island its name.|$|E
5000|$|The {{major new}} {{addition}} to the island has been the Tangier Island History Museum, which created the historical markers that line Tangier’s streets and provide a “historical tour” of the island. Tour guides are also available to offer visitors a narrated ride around the island. The museum’s artifacts are donated or loaned by local residents. The museum also operates a small community library, [...] "Muddy Toes." [...] Visitors often rent kayaks to follow local “water trails." [...] These trails guide visitors around the watermen’s crabbing shacks built on stilts in Tangier Harbor, to navigate the saltwater “guts” that separate the island, or to visit “the Uppards”, a marshy island just {{to the north of}} Tangier that used to have a sizable community until it was abandoned in 1928. Immediately to the east of Tangier, also a kayak paddle away, is Port Isobel, a small island owned by the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which operates an environmental study and retreat center there. Port Isobel’s hiking trails {{are open to the public}} but the <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> is ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes and biting flies, so bug repellent is strongly recommended for anyone visiting.|$|E
40|$|Using {{environmental}} parameters {{we studied}} {{the distribution of}} two endangered species, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L. and Rumex hydrolapathum Huds., in a <b>low-lying</b> <b>marshland</b> of the Swiss Plateau, a region in which aquatic vegetation is particularly threatened. A {{large part of the}} study site is regularly mown by a machine for site management purposes. The caterpillar mower digs ruts, which are especially pronounced along the tracks used to reach the mown compartment. To assess the effects of site management on these species, we have tested six environmental parameters (vegetation unit, water conductivity, water supply indicated by altitude, time elapsed since the last cut, distance from major ruts and disturbance of major ruts) that can potentially influence plant distribution. All the plots of these two species have been found in mowed compartment, which seems to indicate a correlation between site management operations and occurrences. The other factors driving the distribution of these plants are vegetation unit, distance from major ruts and water supply...|$|E
