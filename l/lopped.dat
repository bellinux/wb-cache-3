5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be <b>lopped</b> off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily <b>lopped</b> {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is <b>lopped</b> and 20kg when the lower one third crown is <b>lopped.</b> The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

50|$|German <b>lops</b> {{were about}} 8 lb, slender and large with thick ears. Herschbach, a Mini <b>Lop</b> promoter, {{achieved}} the first procreation of Mini <b>Lops</b> in the United States, mainly through breeding an agouti <b>lop</b> pair {{and a white}} female <b>lop</b> in 1972. Their first baby <b>lops</b> were solid colors. A second generation came with broken colors.

25|$|The Captain John Smith Monument {{currently}} lies in disrepair off {{the coast}} of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a tall pillar set on a triangular base atop a series of steps surrounded by granite supports and a sturdy iron railing. At the top of the original obelisk were three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith <b>lopped</b> off while in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|Neural crest cells (NCC) are {{vertebrate}} {{embryonic stem}} cells that function directly and indirectly during early embryogenesis to produce many tissue types. Because the traits commonly affected by domestication syndrome are all derived from NCC in development, the neural crest hypothesis suggests that deficits in these cells cause the domain of phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome. These deficits could cause changes we see to many domestic mammals, such as <b>lopped</b> ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and donkeys) as well as curly tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although they do not affect {{the development of the}} adrenal cortex directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions. Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Frank Dikötter {{writes that}} beatings with sticks {{was the most}} common method used by local cadres and roughly half of all cadres {{regularly}} pummeled or caned people. Other cadres devised harsher means to humiliate and torture those who failed to keep up. As mass starvation set in, ever greater violence had to be inflicted in order to coerce malnourished people to labor in the fields. Victims were buried alive, thrown bound into ponds, stripped naked and forced to labor in the middle of winter, doused in boiling water, forced to ingest excrement and urine, and subjected to mutilation (hair ripped out, noses and ears <b>lopped</b> off). In Guangdong, some cadres injected salt water into their victims with needles normally reserved for cattle. Around 6 to 8 percent of those who died during the Great Leap Forward were tortured to death or summarily killed.|$|E
50|$|A Dutch rabbit breeder, Adriann de Cock, is {{generally}} credited with developing the dwarf <b>Lop</b> Breeds by crossing together {{the largest of}} the <b>Lop</b> Breeds, French <b>Lop,</b> with the Netherland Dwarf during the winter of year 1949-1950. Years of hard work paid off to produce the smallest of the <b>Lop</b> Breed, and Holland <b>Lops</b> of around 2 kg - 2.5 kg were first shown in 1964.|$|R

50|$|A fix {{is called}} a running fix when {{one or more of}} the <b>LOPs</b> used to obtain it is an <b>LOP</b> {{advanced}} or retrieved over time. In order to get a fix the <b>LOP</b> must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an <b>LOP</b> from the observation but not a fix as another <b>LOP</b> is needed. What may be done is take a first sight which yields one <b>LOP</b> and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second <b>LOP.</b> Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first <b>LOP</b> can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second <b>LOP</b> yields a running fix.|$|R
25|$|Over her career, {{she broke}} {{a number of}} French record ranging from the mile run to the 10,000 metres. Her first {{national}} record mark came in 1985, when she ran a time of 8:52.32 minutes for the 3000 metres. She improved this to 8:50.56 the following month and broke Patricia Deneuville's French mile record a month after that (registering a time of 4:39.35 mins). In July 1986 she <b>lopped</b> {{three and a half}} seconds off her 3000m mark, set a time of 5:39.00 mins for the 2000m, then bettered Joëlle de Brouwer's 5000 metres record by almost twenty seconds, setting a new standard of 15:32.92 mins. Two further improvements over 3000m and 5000m came in 1988, with runs of 8:44.19 and 15:18.24 mins respectively. She also beat Christine Loiseau's record over 10,000m that year. In 1990 she ran 15:16.44 mins for the 5000m, which was to be her last national mark over that distance. Her run of 31:51.68 minutes at that year's European Championships made her the first Frenchwoman to complete the event in under 32 minutes. Although her 2000m time is still the best set by a French athlete, all her records in other events were not long-standing: her 3000m was beaten by Marie-Pierre Duros after a year, her 10,000m mark was beaten by Rosario Murcia after two years, while her 5000m was broken after four years by Farida Fatès.|$|E

50|$|As {{the first}} breed of <b>lop</b> rabbit, the English <b>Lop</b> {{was one of}} the first fancy breeds of rabbit {{developed}} in England, in the 19th century for the purposes of exhibition as a response to rise of animal fancy and consequently the rabbit's emergence as a mainstream household pet during the Victorian era, marking a departure from the earlier role of domesticated rabbit breeding for meat, fur and wool production. Later, the English <b>Lop</b> was bred with other Continental giant breeds of rabbit gave rise to a number of new breeds of <b>lop</b> rabbit, including the French <b>Lop,</b> which developed from breeding between the English <b>Lop</b> and Flemish Giant, and the Holland <b>Lop,</b> which was in turn developed from the French <b>Lop</b> and the Netherlands Dwarf. it is thought that the English <b>lop</b> got the large ears because in the Algeirs it was hot and with the big ears they kept cool.|$|R

500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are <b>lopped</b> off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{strategic}} situation after Lepanto was graphically {{summed up}} {{later by the}} Ottoman Grand Vizier to the Venetian bailo: [...] "The Christians have singed my beard , but I have <b>lopped</b> off an arm. My beard will grow back. The arm , will not". Despite the Grand Vizier's bold statement, however, the damage suffered by the Ottoman fleet was crippling—not {{so much in the}} number of ships lost, but in the almost total loss of the fleet's experienced officers, sailors, technicians and marines. Well aware of how hard it would be to replace such men, in the next year the Venetians and the Spanish executed those experts they had taken captive. In addition, despite the limited strategic impact of the allied victory, an Ottoman victory at Lepanto would have had far more important repercussions: it would have meant the effective disappearance of the Christian naval cadres and allowed the Ottoman fleet to roam the Mediterranean at will, with dire consequences for Malta, Crete and possibly even the Balearics or Venice itself. In the event Lepanto, along with the Ottoman failure at Malta six years earlier, confirmed the de facto division of the Mediterranean, with the eastern half under firm Ottoman control and the western under the Habsburgs and their Italian allies.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans, {{and more}} {{recently}} the Italians, used to plant elms in vineyards as supports for vines. <b>Lopped</b> at three metres, the elms' quick growth, twiggy lateral branches, light shade and root-suckering made them ideal trees for this purpose.

50|$|Once a DTO calculated, {{it can be}} {{combined}} with the known position of the satellites and the receiving station. This combination provides a locus of positions on the Earth’s surface {{for the source of}} the signal; from this result a line of position (<b>LOP)</b> can be derived. A similar line can be derived for the frequency differences. Where the two <b>LOPs</b> intersect is the signal transmission location. In addition to geolocation with a time <b>LOP</b> and a frequency <b>LOP,</b> a location can also be determined by finding the crossing point of two time <b>LOPs.</b> The second time <b>LOP</b> is an identical measurement using a different secondary satellite, or using the same secondary satellite, but later in time. Similarly, two frequency <b>LOPs</b> can be used to determine a location. It can be shown that, in general, it is expected that the two <b>LOPs</b> intersect in two places. In many circumstances it is possible to discount one of the intersections e.g. due to it not being in the coverage area of one or both satellites. In some circumstances, {{it is not possible to}} distinguish intersections from a pair of <b>LOPs,</b> in which case, additional <b>LOPs</b> need to be determined.|$|R
