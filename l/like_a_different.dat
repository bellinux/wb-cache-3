However, after being [...] "taken aback by the uproar of fan support for the original Cole," [...] Sucker Punch combined elements of the original with the new design. Some of Cole's clothing was changed to suit the new setting of the game. Eric Ladin was also brought in to replace Jason Cottle as the voice of Cole because Sucker Punch felt that they needed someone who could perform Cole's physical reactions as well as his voice with the use of their new motion capture technology.|$|E
500|$|Reception to Revelation was positive, {{with some}} critics {{regarding}} the album {{as one of}} Third Day's best albums to date. Andree Farias of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and commented that [...] "Revelation finds Third Day trying new things, but not {{to the extent that they}} sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> band". He felt that the change of environment [...] "intimidated [...] for the better", making them not settle for [...] "middle of the road" [...] songs. He described the album's sound as [...] "muscular" [...] and [...] "anthemic... unquestionably populist, yet the closest Third Day has come to replicating the Southern-fried goodness of Time". He regarded Revelation as [...] "the best album Third Day has released this decade" [...] and considered the album a return to the [...] "unbridled fervor" [...] Third Day was characterized by early in their career.|$|E

[...] McGurk writes that [...] "It's as though she put on her psychoanalytically oriented, professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective."

[...] Even so, the review notes that Fenwick [...] "scores heavily" [...] in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and Erhard's background; it recommends that Getting It be read alongside Luke Rhinehart's The Book of est.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, while Soulfly was on tour, Max {{received}} a call from his brother, {{and by the end of}} the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D-Low, an annual memorial show for Dana. At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, [...] "Roots Bloody Roots" [...] and [...] "Attitude," [...] for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there. What I like about the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> project than anything I've done." ...|$|E

She remarked, [...] "It was a first time experiment for me, but I was able to convey how happiness and sadness are {{two sides of the same}} coin."

Fickett commented that [...] "Basketball" [...] was stylistically different {{from most of}} the other episodes in the fledgling series, pointing to its lack of a sub-plot and its characterization of Michael Scott. Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, [...] "The moment is played mostly straight–and it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a great moment, but feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> show." [...] Overall, he wrote that, [...] "There is still quite a bit of funny stuff , but in many ways, this episode suggests what the show would have been like had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style."

500|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) is returned home {{by her mother}} Marilyn (Amy Madigan) after undergoing a pre-natal test {{to see if she}} has viral propagated eclampsia, a virus that killed her sister and sister's baby during childbirth. She believes she is being followed, and contacts Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) at the Fringe division, who sends over a security detail. By the time they arrive, Fauxlivia has been kidnapped; though they try to follow a secret tracker each agent carries, her abductors have extracted it to throw Fringe off their tracks. Walternate (John Noble) and Lincoln believe the abduction to be an inside job due to this. Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) identifies a vehicle that has passed by Fauxlivia's home at a high frequency, that being the taxi that belongs to Henry (Andre Royo). Lincoln and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) track down Henry, who explains he has been keeping an eye on Fauxlivia, surprised to have seen her return and seeming <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person than his previous encounters with her; Henry is unaware that he had actually helped the prime universe's Olivia to escape ("Olivia" [...] and [...] "The Abducted"). Lincoln, suspicious of these events, forces Walternate to admit that Fauxlivia was switched with Olivia, and that the child Fauxlivia carries is his grandchild. Meanwhile, Marilyn learns that Fauxlivia's test for the virus is positive and warns Charlie that Fauxlivia will die if she has the child.|$|E
500|$|... "Chillin" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Steve Roberts from MTV praised Gaga's verse and for employing a similar singing style to M.I.A.. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the [...] "club-ready single" [...] for its [...] "bouncy hook and slick verses" [...] {{and called the}} song [...] "the perfect precursor to Wale's long-awaited debut". Mehan Jayasuriya from PopMatters commended the song for being a [...] "token party jam" [...] on the album track list. She added that [...] "for all the flack that the [...] has caught, it's still an indisputably catchy song, even if the 9th Wonder and Nick Catchdubs reworking from [...] Back to the Feature stands as the definitive version." [...] Andres Tardio from HipHopDX believed {{the composition of the}} song as [...] "Pop-friendly". A reviewer for XXL compared and described [...] "Chillin" [...] as [...] "distinctly D.C.-sounding anthem". David Jeffries from AllMusic praised Wale's [...] "natural delivery and quirky sense of humor" [...] in the song, likening his vocals to that of Jay-Z and Gaga's vocals to that of singer Rihanna. Describing [...] "Chillin" [...] as a [...] "club-friendly hopper", Chris Richards from The Washington Post believed that using Rihanna or M.I.A. on the track would have made it successful, rather than Gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer. Richards recalled a similar situation when Washington D.C. based go-go band Experience Unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer Grace Jones on a track.

500|$|The Way I See It was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that The Way I See It [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E
