50|$|With an ethnological, historical, {{geographical}} {{and theological}} point of view, Baldaeus recorded {{everything that he}} himself or from the knowledge of high caste learned people (pundits). in addition he gathered material brought by interpreters from the holdings of the Jesuit libraries in Ceylon and southern India and also later in the Netherlands from all the accessible literature about this part of South Asia. Thus, his knowledge of Sanskrit, {{as well as of}} the Portuguese as a lingua franca was widely used by him; In addition, he cited in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, French and Italian. His portrayal of Tamil language was groundbreaking although he admitted that he had only basic skills ("he knew probably not much more than the alphabet”). He was quite different from the Jesuits who learned Tamil so well that they confound even the Tamil pundits in <b>language</b> <b>competitions</b> with their <b>language</b> proficiency. He was not comparable to the Jesuit priests in his knowledge of Tamil as they were better scholars of Tamil. Jesuits even shamed the Tamil pundits in <b>language</b> <b>competitions</b> with their <b>language</b> skills.

50|$|The Sixian dialect of Taiwan is {{slightly}} {{different from the}} Meixian dialect of mainland China since the majority of immigrants from Jiaying Prefecture are from Zhenping County, which is present-day Jiaoling County, so the Sixian dialect {{is closer to the}} Jiaoling dialect of mainland China. There are also differences in vocabulary and phonology between the Sixian dialect spoken in northern Taiwan (called Northern Sixian or Miaoli dialect) and in Liudui of southern Taiwan (called Southern Sixian). Because {{of the differences between the}} two varieties of Sixian, the recitation contests in the National <b>Language</b> <b>Competition</b> separate the contest into the two accents of (Northern) Sixian and Southern Sixian. Alternatively, Sixian may include Xingning and Changle, but because these two counties were formerly a part of Huizhou fu, they may be closer to the Hailu dialect.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{difficult to define}} reasonable parameters and interpret their values in mathematical models of social phenomena. Rather than directly fitting abstract parameters against empirical data, we should define some concrete parameters to denote the sociocultural factors relevant for particular phenomena, and compute the values of these parameters based upon the corresponding empirical data. Taking the example of modeling studies of <b>language</b> <b>competition,</b> we propose a language diffusion principle and two language inheritance principles to compute two critical parameters, namely the impacts and inheritance rates of competing languages, in our <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> model derived from the Lotka-Volterra competition model in evolutionary biology. These principles assign explicit sociolinguistic meanings to those parameters and calculate their values from the relevant data of population censuses and language surveys. Using four examples of <b>language</b> <b>competition,</b> we illustrate that our <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> model with thus-estimated parameter values can reliably replicate and predict the dynamics of <b>language</b> <b>competition,</b> and it is especially useful in cases lacking direct competition data. postprin...|$|E

30|$|Research on {{language}} evolution {{can be divided}} into two categories: language origin and change, and <b>language</b> <b>competition.</b> The former is usually carried out in an interdisciplinary manner, with relatively obvious cross characterizations of linguistics, evolutionary biology, nerve and brain function science, informetrics, and computer science. Research regarding <b>language</b> <b>competition,</b> on the other hand, is typically considered to be more practical, as various models produced in <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> research can provide a quantitative evaluation and estimation for the tendency of the two languages in competition.|$|E
30|$|Language is {{characterized}} by both ecological properties and social properties, and competition is the basic form of language evolution. The rise and decline of one language {{is a result of}} competition between languages. Moreover, this rise and decline directly influences the diversity of human culture. Mathematics and computer modeling for <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> has been a popular topic in the fields of linguistics, mathematics, computer science, ecology, and other disciplines. Currently, there are several problems in the research on <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> modeling. First, comprehensive mathematical analysis is absent in most studies of <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> models. Next, most <b>language</b> <b>competition</b> models are {{based on the assumption that}} one language in the model is stronger than the other. These studies tend to ignore cases where there is a balance of power in the competition. The competition between two well-matched languages is more practical, because it can facilitate the co-development of two languages. A third issue with current studies is that many studies have an evolution result where the weaker language inevitably goes extinct. From the integrated point of view of ecology and sociology, this paper improves the Lotka–Volterra model and basic reaction–diffusion model to propose an “ecology–society” computational model for describing <b>language</b> <b>competition.</b> Furthermore, a strict and comprehensive mathematical analysis was made for the stability of the equilibria. Two languages in competition may be either well-matched or greatly different in strength, which was reflected in the experimental design. The results revealed that language coexistence, and even co-development, are likely to occur during <b>language</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E

That is, {{there is only one}} unidirectional attractive force c of the stronger language to the weaker language. However, in the present model, the attractive forces of both c [...]...|$|E
