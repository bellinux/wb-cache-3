40|$|The recent advancements in the {{communication}} area have enabled the Internet of Things, a paradigm which extends the Internet to everyday objects. The Internet of Things enables many new applications, but {{also comes with}} great challenges; effective communication under limited power supply being the perhaps most important one. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an energy-efficient handover algorithm for the main building block {{in the creation of}} the Internet of Things: wireless sensor networks. Our low-power handover design is based on a careful breakdown and analysis of the potential power consumption of different components of the handover process. With the scanning part of the process being identified as the main drain of energy, the algorithm is designed to place the majority of the scanning responsibility on the mains powered access points, rather than on the low-power mobile nodes. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and its functionality and low power consumption have been empirically evaluated. We show that the design can reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude compared to existing handover algorithms for wireless sensor networks. In addition, interesting fading effects were discovered in a sparsely deployed network scenario with <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> coverage; most likely due to multipath propagation. For this case the handover performance was greatly reduced, relative our more normal coverage scenario. While these results illustrate that the absolute energy savings will differ from scenario to scenario, the potential energy savings made possible by the proposed algorithm significantly reduce the battery requirements of the devices in the emerging landscape of the Internet of Things; potentially even opening the door for new devices to connect...|$|E
50|$|Lost Turkey Trail was {{constructed}} on existing trails {{with the addition}} of some new connectors. It is marked with 2-by-6-inch orange blazes. In the state forest section, part of the trail shares a pathway with an existing snowmobile trail, and in this area the red blazes share space with orange diamond-shaped blazes. Another part of the trail passes through private land; permission has been secured, but the landowners have requested the prohibition of fires, motorized vehicles, and littering. This creates another challenge for the planning of backpacking trips. Day hikes on Lost Turkey Trail are certainly possible, but the <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> usually necessitate car shuttling.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} sensor networks with two special characteristics. First, the nodes periodically generate data for transfer to a distinguished node called the <b>access</b> <b>point.</b> Second, the nodes are (transmit) power and energy <b>limited,</b> but the <b>access</b> <b>point,</b> which communicates with the 'outside world', is not so limited. Such networks might be used for instance when a geographically distributed physical process, such as traffic on a freeway or at an urban street intersection, is periodically sensed for purposes of process control. We propose a medium access control scheme, called PEDAMACS, for this special class of networks. PEDAMACS uses the high-powered <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to synchronize the nodes and to schedule their transmissions and receptions in a TDMA manner. The protocol first enables the <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to gather topology (connectivity) information. A scheduling algorithm then determines when each node should transmit its data, and the <b>access</b> <b>point</b> announces the transmission schedule to the other nodes. The scheduling algorithm ideally should minimize the delay-the time needed for data from all nodes to reach the <b>access</b> <b>point.</b> However, this optimization problem is NP-complete. PEDAMACS instead uses a polynomial-time scheduling algorithm which guarantees a delay proportional {{to the number of}} nodes in the sensor network.

40|$|This paper explores {{efficient}} 3 G budget utilization {{in mobile}} participatory sensing applications. 1 Distinct from previous research work that either rely on <b>limited</b> WiFi <b>access</b> <b>points</b> or assume {{the availability of}} unlimited 3 G communication capability, we offer a more practical participatory sensing system that leverages potential 3 G budgets that participants contribute at will, and uses it efficiently customized {{for the needs of}} multiple participatory sensing applications with heterogeneous sensitivity to environmental changes. We address the challenge that the information of data generation and WiFi encounters is not a priori knowledge, and propose an online decision making algorithm that takes advantage of participants' historical data. We also develop a heuristic algorithm to consume less energy and reduce the storage overhead while maintaining efficient 3 G budget utilization.

40|$|Presently, IEEE 802. 11 based {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLAN) {{have been widely}} deployed for business and personal applications. The main issue regarding wireless network technology is handoff or hand over management, especially in urban areas, due to the <b>limited</b> coverage of <b>access</b> <b>points</b> (APs) or base stations (BS).

Here we propose a method to minimize the handoff failure probability by effectively placing a wireless local area network (WLAN) AP in the handoff region between two neighboring cells. The WLAN coverage, on one hand, provides an additional coverage in the low signal strength region, and on the other hand, relieves the congestion in the cellular network. Moreover, we perform the channel scanning (required for horizontal handover between the two base stations) within the WLAN coverage area, thus minimizing the handoff failure due to scanning delay...|$|R

30|$|It {{used to be}} a {{fundamental}} belief that radio units cannot transmit and receive concurrently {{at the same time and}} frequency resources due to the self-interference (SI) [4], i.e., the duplexing of transmission and reception must be done by either frequency division duplex (FDD) or time division duplex (TDD). Both FDD and TDD have the disadvantage of wasting time and frequency resources [5]. However, recent advances in signal processing have made it possible to reduce the effect of SI, allowing IBFD wireless communications [6, 7]. The authors of [6] demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the SI using analog and digital interference cancellation techniques by more than 78 dB with antenna separations of 20 and 40 cm. In [7], a 110 dB of SI cancellation was achieved in a dense indoor office environment with 80 MHz bandwidth. The analog cancellation circuit in [7] has the dimensions of (10 cm × 10 cm).
