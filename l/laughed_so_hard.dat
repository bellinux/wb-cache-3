500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras <b>laughed</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{called the}} episode a potential classic and a [...] "phenomenal follow up showing" [...] {{to the season}} premiere [...] "Sexual Healing", {{which he did not}} enjoy. Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art.

2500|$|He said Norton's {{experience}} as a theatre actor combined with his self-confidence meant that [...] "in a way {{there was some kind}} of mental reality to Edward", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on.

[...] Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the [...] "embodiment" [...] of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone [...] "who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world." [...] Iñárritu agreed.|$|E

Weller remembers that during the scene where his character is tortured by Dr. Lizardo, [...] "I never <b>laughed</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> in my life!

50|$|The {{recording}} {{had to be}} restarted {{several times}} because the trombone players were <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> at the jokes that {{they were unable to}} play their instruments.

2500|$|The {{same year}} the fledgling film writer and {{director}} Mel Brooks pitched his project, Springtime for Hitler to Glazier, having previously made numerous unsuccessful attempts to interest movie producers.

[...] "He spit out his coffee and tuna sandwich and couldn't stop laughing," [...] recalled Brooks. [...] "He said [...] "I vow to get this movie made. The world must see this picture."" [...] Glazier struggled at first to interest movie studios in the show business satire, but with perseverance Joseph E. Levine at Avco Embassy accepted the project and agreed to let Brooks direct the movie. [...] Filming was not without its challenges. Brooks was an anxious, perfectionist and difficult novice director, who had problems communicating with the actors.

Altogether it was a very nice world, a very nice world indeed to live in. Somehow {{he felt as if he}} never wanted to cry again.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} sundown {{when they came}} {{to the edge of the}} forest and saw spread out before them a {{delightful}} landscape. There were broad blue fields stretching for miles over the valley, which was dotted everywhere with pretty, blue domed houses, none of which, however, was very near to the place where they stood. Just at the point where the path left the forest stood a tiny house covered with leaves from the trees, and before this stood a Munchkin man with an axe in his hand.

6000|$|After the gymnastics, Demi and Tommy {{spoke the}} old school dialogue, [...] "Money makes the mare go."
