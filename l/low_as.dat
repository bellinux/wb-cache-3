In {{an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly, Sánchez revealed that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine reported a $35,000 estimated budget. Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000. By September 2016, The Blair Witch Project has been officially budgeted at $60,000.|$|E

Fares start as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> $1, {{with the lowest}} fares depending on how far in advance a trip is booked and demand for the trip, with fares increasing for trips booked closer to departure. BoltBus uses newer model coaches that are equipped with Wi-Fi, power outlets, and leather seats with extra legroom.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were <b>low,</b> <b>as</b> {{in much of}} the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|Centers {{of surface}} high- and {{low-pressure}} {{areas that are}} found within closed isobars on a surface weather analysis are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general weather is in their vicinity.

After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90percent, maintaining 80 to 90percent approval {{for four months}} after the attacks.

5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reproducing}} readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction and hunting for bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, {{the population in the}} wild is believed to have crashed as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting, making them far more critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be <b>low,</b> <b>as</b> is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Royal Opera House {{received}} a government subsidy {{of just over}} £27m, compared with a subsidy of £15m in 1998. This sum was divided between the opera and ballet companies {{and the cost of}} running the building. Compared with opera houses in mainland Europe, Covent Garden's public subsidy has remained <b>low</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of its income – typically 43%, compared with 60% for its counterpart in Munich.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E

5|$|In September 2008, Intel {{announced}} the X25-M SATA SSD with a reported WA as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> 1.1. In April 2009, SandForce {{announced the}} SF-1000 SSD Processor {{family with a}} reported WA of 0.5 which appears to come from some form of data compression. Before this announcement, a write amplification of 1.0 was considered the lowest that could be attained with an SSD. Currently, only SandForce employs compression in its SSD controller.|$|E
5|$|Intel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) {{used the}} term write {{amplification}} in their papers and publications as early as 2008. Write amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system. Without compression, write amplification cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write amplification of 0.5, with best-case values as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{difference}} {{concerns the}} movement of the centre of mass of the body. In walking the body [...] "vaults" [...] over the leg on the ground, raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical, and dropping it to the <b>lowest</b> <b>as</b> the legs are spread apart. Essentially kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in potential energy. This is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its <b>lowest</b> <b>as</b> the leg is vertical. This is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in muscles and tendons. In running there is a conversion between kinetic, potential, and elastic energy.|$|R

Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as <b>low</b> <b>as</b> 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey has {{assessed}} the extinct Kohala as a low-risk area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), while {{the border of}} the volcano with Mauna Kea is zone 8 (second <b>lowest),</b> <b>as</b> Mauna Kea has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years.|$|R
