2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigated}} the crash {{and determined that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} structural failure that occurred at the wing-to-fuselage attach point, with the right wing failing just before the left one. The investigation disclosed [...] "evidence of fatigue cracks in the right wing's lower surface skin panel, with origins beneath the forward doubler.... The origin points were determined to be in rivet holes which join the external doubler and the internal stringers to the <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> These cracks, which grew together to about a [...] length, were found to have propagated past the area where they would have been covered by the doubler and into the stringers beneath the doubler and across the lap joint between the middle skin panel and the forward skin panel." ...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle orbiter <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> were {{analyzed}} under pressure loads simulating hydrodynamic loads {{to determine their}} capability to sustain a potential ditching and to determine pressures that typically would produce failures. Two Dynamic Crash Analysis of Structures (DYCAST) finite element models were used.

From {{an assessment of the}} DYCAST nonlinear computer results, it is concluded that the probability is extremely high that most, if not all, of the <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> would rupture under ditching conditions. Extremely high pressure loads which are produced under hydrodynamic planning conditions far exceed the very low predicted failure pressures for the <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> Consequently, a ditching of the orbiter is not considered to have a high probability of success and should not be considered a means of emergency landing unless no other option exists...|$|R
40|$|In this study, flutter {{analyses}} are performed for generic adaptive camber wings with hingeless trailing edge control surfaces. These control surfaces {{operate based on}} a concept that exploits the controlled flexibility of the semi-open secondary wing structure. By introducing structural modifications that allow for chordwise sliding between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels,</b> positive or negative camber changes may be realized for the wing. Using MSC ® PATRAN package, wing finite element models are created. In these models, components of the adaptive camber wing, i. e. front and rear spars, spar caps, skins, ribs, stringers and control bars are defined as separate property regions. In order to model the hingeless control surfaces, multi-point-constraints (MPC) are used to represent the sliding action, {{as well as the}} interactions between several components. In aeroelastic models created using MSC® FLDS, structural and aerodynamic degrees-of-freedom (dof) are coupled to each other using infinite plate spline functions. The unsteady aerodynamic loads are represented using the Doublet-Lattice Method (DLM). In numerical analyses performed, two different wing configurations are considered, namely Wings A and B. In Wing A, a single hingeless control surface extends throughout the full wing span. Wing B has the same structural properties as Wing A, except for the hingeless control surface, which is split into two equal sized parts. The results of the free vibration analyses show that for both wing configurations, the control surface motion is highly coupled to the bending and torsion type global modes. Furthermore, in the second configuration, additional local modes are observed for the control surface. As a final study, p-k method is employed to calculate flutter speeds for Wings A and B and to identify the modes of instability...|$|R

Because {{of the importance of}} <b>skin</b> <b>panels,</b> considerable care is taken in minimizing defects such as the 'hollow' defect that occur around door-handle depressions.

In this inspection process, the geometry of a panel is captured using a structured lighting system. The geometry data is subsequently analyzed by a purpose-built wavelet-based algorithm to identify the location of any defects that may be present and to estimate the perceived severity of the defects without user intervention. This paper describes and critically evaluates the behavior of this physically-based algorithm on an ideal and real geometry and compares its result to an actual audit. The results show that the algorithm is capable of objectively locating and classifying 'hollow' defects in actual panels...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of general European rules {{for the design of}} aluminium structures, specific rules for the design of aluminum stressed <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> are available.

The optimized extrusions fulfill Class 3 section properties, leading to weight reductions up to 25 % of regularly-used shear panel sections. When the design is based on Class 4 section properties, even more weight reduction may be reached. The typical failure mode of the optimized stressed <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> depends on the applied height of the hat stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners, failure is introduced by yielding of the heat-affected zone.
