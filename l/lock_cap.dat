50|$|The buttstock, lower {{handguard}} {{and upper}} heatguard are manufactured from birch plywood laminates like the later model AK-47 furniture. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping {{better than the}} conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper.The wooden buttstock used in the AKM is further hollowed {{in order to reduce}} weight and is longer and straighter than that of the AK-47, which assists accuracy for subsequent shots during rapid and automatic fire. The wooden stock also houses the issued cleaning kit, which is a small diameter metal tube with a twist <b>lock</b> <b>cap.</b> The kit normally contains the cleaning jag to which a piece of cloth material is wrapped around and dipped into cleaning solution. It also contains a pin punch, an assembly pin to hold the trigger, disconnector and rate reducer together while putting these back into the receiver after cleaning the weapon, and a barrel brush. The kit is secured inside the butt stock via a spring-loaded trap door in the stock's pressed sheet metal butt cap.|$|E
40|$|Background Many cancer {{patients}} receive a {{central venous catheter}} or port system prior to therapy to assure correct drug administration. Even appropriate hygienic intervention maintenance carries the risk of contaminating the middle port (C-port) of a three-way cock (TWC), a risk that increases {{with the number of}} medical interventions. Because of the complexity of the cleaning procedure with disconnection and reconnection of the standard luer <b>lock</b> <b>cap</b> (referred as “intervention”), we compared luer lock caps with a “closed access system” consisting of a luer access split septum system with regard to process optimization (work simplification, process time), efficiency (costs) and hygiene (patient safety). Methods For determination of process optimization the workflow of an intervention according to the usual practice and risks was depicted in a process diagram. For determining the actual process costs, we analyzed use of material and time parameters per intervention and used the process parameters for programming the process into a simulation run (n = 1000) to determine the process costs as well as their differences (ACTUAL vs. NOMINAL) within the framework of a discrete event simulation. Additionally cultures were carried out at the TWC C-ports to evaluate possible contamination. Results With the closed access system, the mean working time of 5. 5 minutes could be reduced to 2. 97 minutes. The results for average process costs (labour and material costs per use) were 3. 92 € for luer lock caps and 2. 55 € for the closed access system. The hypothesis test (2 -sample t-test, CI 0. 95, p-value< 0. 05) confirmed the significance of the result. In 50 reviewed samples (TWC’s), the contamination rate for the luer <b>lock</b> <b>cap</b> was 8...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards in Poland {{are laid out}} according to the standard US visual and functional layout.

50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being shifted by <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> shifts all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> only shifts alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if <b>Caps</b> <b>Lock</b> is currently active or not.

25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a <b>locking</b> gas <b>cap</b> to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of <b>locking</b> gas <b>caps</b> was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with <b>locking</b> gas <b>caps).</b> The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|R
