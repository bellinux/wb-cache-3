40|$|Background: Robotic {{vehicles}} such as {{straddle carriers}} represent a popular form of cargo handling amongst container terminal operators. Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} industry-driven study is to model preventative maintenance (PM) influences on the operational effectiveness of straddle carriers. Method: The study employs historical data consisting of 21 273 work orders covering a 27 -month period. Two models are developed, both of which forecast influences of PM regimes for different types of carrier. Results: The findings of the study suggest that {{the reliability of the}} straddle fleet decreases with increased intervals of PM services. The study also finds that three factors – namely resources, number of new straddles, and the number of new <b>lifting</b> work <b>centres</b> – influence the performances of straddles. Conclusion: The authors argue that this collaborative research exercise makes a significant contribution to existing supply chain management literature, particularly in the area of operations efficiency. The study also serves as an avenue to enhance relevant management practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to obtain the exact {{solution}} for the profile and characteristics of a two-dimensional sail, immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid. An experimental investigation was also performed and results are compared with theoretical predictions. The sail {{was assumed to be}} an infinitely flexible, non-porous membrane of zero thickness, fixed at the leading and trailing edges, and stretched under a constant tension T in the sail surface. An aerofoil model was considered where the airflow remains smoothly attached over the entire profile. All known previous studies have also used the inviscid fluid approximation, but made the further assumptions of small angle of attack and negligible profile slopes. These assumptions enable the use of thin aerofoil theory predictions for pressure distribution and linearisation of the sail equation. In contrast this investigation obtains the exact solution. An iterative numerical method is devised whereby an initial estimate is made for the profile using thin aerofoil theory. The pressure distribution is then determined using Theodorsen's method and the profile recalculated using the full sail equation, so that tension and pressure forces are balanced. The cycle of redetermining the pressure distribution and profile is repeated until a convergent solution is obtained. Results are shown for the profile, <b>lift</b> coefficient and <b>centre</b> of pressure, for various angles of attack and states of tension. For sails with non-negligible camber, values of <b>lift</b> coefficient and <b>centre</b> of pressure are found to differ significantly from those predicted by the linear approximations. Previous researchers have established the existence of a critical tension state where the tension force is unable to contain the pressure forces acting on the sail, and predicted that the value of this state (KTc) was independent of angle of attack. However this study indicates that KTc increases with increasing angle of attack. Centre of pressure calculations, for various angles of attack and states of tension, indicate that two-dimensional sails may possess either static longitudinal stability or instability, depending on the tension state. Experimental results for the profile, KTc, <b>lift</b> coefficient and <b>centre</b> of pressure are compared with theory, and areas of agreement and disagreement discussed. Experimental values for the drag coefficient and the lift to drag ratio were obtained and are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Year] doi: 10. 1136 / bjophthalmol- 2014 - 305101 Aims To {{establish}} the novel {{concept of a}} functional eyelid centre to determine the optimal point for eyelid lifting in ptosis surgery. Methods This was a prospective study of 112 patients with congenital ptosis. The functional eyelid centre {{was defined as the}} point where the eyelid contour showed the best appearance when the upper eyelid was lifted manually. In patients who underwent frontalis suspension surgery using silicone rods, the postoperative outcome was assessed according to the fixation point of the rod. Results The average horizontal fissure width and the distance from the medial canthus to the mid-pupillary line were 21. 9 and 10. 1 mm, respectively. The functional eyelid centre was located 4. 28 ± 0. 98 mm temporal to the mid-pupillary line. The outcomes of silicone rod surgeries were excellent when the rod was fixated 4. 4 mm nasal and 3. 9 mm temporal from the functional eyelid centre. These positions corresponded to 0. 1 mm nasal and 8. 2 mm temporal from the mid-pupillary line. Conclusions The functional eyelid centre was located slightly temporal to the mid-pupillary line. A better eyelid contour in ptosis surgery is produced when eyelid <b>lifting</b> is <b>centred</b> around the functional eyelid centre...|$|R
5000|$|Not {{more than}} five and not less than two loaders/spotters shall be in attendance. The lifter may enlist the help {{of one or more}} of the {{designated}} spotters or enlist a personal spotter in removing the bar from the racks. Only designated spotters may remain on the platform during the lift. The lift off must be to arms length and not down to the chest. A designated spotter, having provided a <b>centre</b> <b>lift</b> off, must immediately clear the area in front of the head referee and move to either side of the bar. If the personal spotter does not immediately leave the platform area and/or in any way distracts or impedes the head referees' responsibilities, the referees may determine that the lift is unacceptable, and be declared [...] "no lift" [...] by the referees and given three red lights.|$|R
40|$|Independent {{numerical}} {{methods for}} obtaining the subsonic load distribution on a thin wing of arbitrary twist and camber {{have been developed}} at NPL, NLR (Netherlands) and BAC (Warton). The three methods have been studied jointly and their novel features have been reviewed critically. The best solutions by each method show excellent agreement for wings, at uniform incidence, having smooth leading and trailing edges. Spanwise loading, local aerodynamic <b>centres,</b> <b>lift,</b> pitching moment, vortex drag and chordwise loadings are tabulated for circular and rectangular planforms, for a wing of constant chord with hyperbolic leading and trailing edges, and for a tapered sweptback wing. The convergence of the solutions is examined in detail with respect to separate parameters representing the numbers of spanwise integration points and spanwise and chordwise collocation points. The tapered sweptback planform is considered with different amounts and types of artificial central rounding, but the crucial problem of a central kink under lifting conditions remains a subject for research...|$|R
40|$|The {{work done}} at each step, during level walking at a {{constant}} average speed, to <b>lift</b> the <b>centre</b> of mass of the body, to accelerate it forward, and to increase the sum of both gravitational potential and kinetic energies, has been measured at various speeds on children of 2 - 12 years of age, with the same technique used previously for adults (Cavagna, 1975; Cavagna, Thys & Zamboni, 1976). The pendulum-like transfer between potential and kinetic energies (Cavagna et al. 1976) reaches a maximum at {{the speed at which}} the weight-specific work to move the centre of mass a given distance is at a minimum ('optimal' speed). This speed is about 2 X 8 km/hr at 2 years of age and increases progressively with age up to 5 km/hr at 12 years of age and in adults. The speed freely chosen during steady walking at the different ages is similar to this 'optimal' speed. At the 'optimal' speed, the time of single contact (time of swing) is in good agreement with that predicted, for the same stature, by a ballistic walking model assuming a minimum of muscular work (Mochon & McMahon, 1980). Above the 'optimal' speed, the recovery of mechanical energy through the potential-kinetic energy transfer decreases. This decrease is greater the younger the subject. A reduction of this recovery implies a greater amount of work to be supplied by muscles: at 4 X 5 km/hr the weight-specific muscular power necessary to move the centre of mass is 2 X 3 times greater in a 2 -year-old child than in an adult...|$|R
50|$|Another timber wharf {{was located}} on the south bank about 600 m {{upstream}} from the current bridges across the Hunter River. This was near the Wheatsheaf Hotel, once operated by John Hannell, whose tomb is nearby. When it was constructed, the first Hexham bridge was built with a <b>centre</b> <b>lifting</b> span so small ships could travel to this wharf, even in the 1960s. (Similarly, the Stockton Bridge further downstream was built with a high arch so ships could travel upstream to Hexham by the north channel of the Hunter River to load coal at Hexham.) This wharf was eventually used by the Bellbird-Hetton Colliery to load coal. (It has a depot to the west, across the Pacific Highway and Great North Railway, {{at the end of}} what is now Woodlands Road.) This loader was later taken over by Peko-Wallsend in the 1960s, which also built six 600 LT coal silos (painted green) on the river bank and conveyors across the railway and highway to expedite loading. These facilities were demolished in the 1980-90s.|$|R
40|$|The {{work done}} {{at each step}} during level walking and running to <b>lift</b> the <b>centre</b> of mass of the body, Wv, and to {{increase}} its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2 - 32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext) /(/Wv/ + /Wf/) : it attains a maximum (about 65 %) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot {{in contact with the}} ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0 - 4 % independent of speed), i. e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h. p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf 2 /(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step...|$|R
