5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{said there}} were many cases on record of Home levitating, but skeptics assert the alleged <b>levitations</b> {{occurred}} in darkened conditions susceptible to trickery.|$|R
50|$|Despite Joseph's {{incapacity}} for {{the necessary}} scholarly studies, and preference for just managing the sheep {{and other animals}} in the friary's stable, Joseph does become a priest. Although he learns little from the tutoring by the friars, Joseph passes the necessary examinations for the priesthood {{through a series of}} unlikely or possibly miraculous events. Soon after, when Joseph is seen levitating {{at the time of his}} ecstatic prayers to the Virgin Mary, one of the superiors in the community, (Ricardo Montalban), claims that Joseph suffers from demonic possession. Joseph is therefore exorcised, but his <b>levitations</b> continue, persuading everyone—including his former critic—of the divine origins of his <b>levitations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The in-game {{exploration}} is chiefly {{based on}} walking and running; however, there are instances when swimming and sometimes <b>levitation</b> is involved. Transportation of other kinds, such as teleportation, and traveling by boat {{or on the}} back of giant flea-like creatures called silt striders, is available for a fee when moving between the various settlements on Vvardenfell.|$|E
5|$|Trevor H. Hall who {{researched}} {{the case in}} detail established that the <b>levitation</b> took place at Ashley Place in Westminster at a height of 35 feet and suggested rather than levitating Home had stepped across a gap of four feet between two iron balconies. Gordon Stein {{also noted that the}} gap between the two balconies was only four feet making passing between them entirely feasible.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on {{a mystical}} {{floating}} landmass called Angel Island after Sonic and Tails defeat {{him at the}} end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. As Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient echidna civilization that once inhabited the island, as well as the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its <b>levitation</b> powers. Realizing Sonic and Tails will try to track him down, Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Master Emerald, turning the two against each other while Robotnik tries to repair his space station.|$|E
5000|$|Skeptics are not {{convinced}} that Saint Joseph possessed magical or paranormal powers. They have suggested that alleged eyewitness reports of his <b>levitations</b> are unreliable as {{they are subject to}} gross exaggeration, or written years after his death.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{strange and}} bizarre {{accidents}} claim {{the lives of}} Ruby's employees, then Leslie begins to show strange behaviour, and then begins to speak... in her dead father's voice.

5000|$|Jones' table installation, [...] "Elevations <b>Levitations</b> and the Twist," [...] {{which was}} shown at Toronto's A Space in 1974 {{and is now}} in the {{permanent}} collection of The Art Gallery of Ontario, was presented in the reopening exhibitions of the new Frank Gehry-designed AGO in November 2008.|$|R
5|$|Sai Baba's disciples and devotees {{claim that}} he {{performed}} many miracles such as bilocation, <b>levitation,</b> mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) {{to people in the}} form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, <b>levitation,</b> etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic <b>levitation</b> of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E
50|$|Habitual <b>Levitations</b> (Instilling Words with Tones) is {{the fourth}} {{full-length}} album from American progressive metal band Intronaut. It was released 18 March 2013 in Europe and 19 March 2013 in North America on Century Media Records, which also released their previous two albums Prehistoricisms and Valley of Smoke.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{investigators}} caught Palladino cheating, {{they were convinced}} Palladino produced genuine supernatural phenomena such as <b>levitations</b> of the table, movement of the curtains, movement of objects from behind the curtain and touches from hands.

5000|$|Robert D. Smith in {{his book}} Comparative Miracles (1965) {{suggested}} that Saint Joseph performed feats similar to a gymnast. Smith noted {{that some of his}} alleged <b>levitations</b> [...] "originate from a leap, and not from a prone or simple standing or kneeling position, the witnesses mistook a leap of a very agile man for levitation." ...|$|R
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a group of Magnemite—magnet-like Pokémon with <b>levitation</b> abilities—delivering a {{television}} to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a beta tester. He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian Treecko and the avian Torchic. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second beta tester.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{immediately}} after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's <b>levitation</b> powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic <b>levitation</b> never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
50|$|In early 2012, Intronaut {{supported}} Tool on {{the first}} leg of their North American tour. After the tour, they commenced writing for their fourth studio album, Habitual <b>Levitations</b> (Instilling Words with Tones), which was released on March 19, 2013. In April 2014 they supported TesseracT in their North American tour, as well as serving as the live backing band for one man progressive outfit Cloudkicker's live debut.|$|R
5000|$|Human {{poisoning}} due to {{the consumption}} of rye bread made from ergot-infected grain was common in Europe in the Middle Ages. It was known to cause convulsion symptoms and hallucinations. British academic John Cornwell has suggested that Saint Joseph had consumed rye bread (see ergot poisoning) [...] According to Cornwell [...] "Here, perhaps, lay {{the key to his}} <b>levitations.</b> After sampling his own loaves he evidently believed he was taking off." ...|$|R
5000|$|Science writer Martin Gardner {{dismissed}} Beloff as credulous {{and willing}} to believe. Beloff had endorsed some fraudulent mediums such as Helen Duncan. Gardner quoted Beloff as admitting [...] "my own ignorance of conjuring techniques may have misled me", but Gardner noted despite this, he still went on believing. Beloff had endorsed <b>levitations,</b> psychic surgery, the [...] "thoughtographs" [...] of Ted Serios and various spiritualist mediums as genuine evidence for the paranormal.|$|R
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of <b>Levitation</b> until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} Aérotrain {{was similar}} to that of the {{magnetic}} <b>levitation</b> train: to suspend the train above the tracks so the only resistance is that of air resistance. Consequently, the Aérotrain could travel at very high speeds without the technical complexity and expensive tracks of magnetic <b>levitation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to Rolling Stone {{columnist}} David Fricke [...] "...tripsters the Black Angels {{bring the}} aura of mid-1966 - the drilling guitars of early Velvet Underground shows, the raga inflections of late-show Fillmore jams, the acid-prayer stomp of Austin avatars the 13th Floor Elevators - everywhere they go, including the <b>levitations</b> on their second album, Directions to See a Ghost (Light in the Attic). Mid-Eighties echoes of Spacemen 3 and the Jesus and Mary Chain also roll through the scoured-guitar sustain and Alex Maas' rocker-monk incantations." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1908, the SPR {{appointed}} {{a committee of}} three to examine the medium Eusapia Palladino in Naples. The committee consisted of Baggally, Hereward Carrington and Everard Feilding. Although the investigators caught Palladino cheating during the séances, they were convinced Palladino had produced genuine paranormal phenomena such as <b>levitations</b> of the table, movement of the curtains, movement of objects from behind the curtain and touches from hands. In 1909, all three investigators wrote {{a report on the}} medium in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.|$|R
60|$|So far as {{any effect}} from these {{exposures}} was concerned, {{they were as}} harmless as those exposures of fraudulent spiritistic mediums which {{from time to time}} are supposed to shake the spiritistic superstition to its foundations. They really do nothing of the kind; the table-tippings, rappings, materializations, and <b>levitations</b> keep on as before; and I {{do not believe that the}} exposure of the novelist who has been the latest victim of the parallel column will injure him a jot in the hearts or heads of his readers.|$|R
25|$|Each {{implementation}} of the magnetic <b>levitation</b> principle for train-type travel involves advantages and disadvantages.|$|E

50|$|According to his 1936 {{obituary}} in The Truth, Harrie {{went on to}} run various sideshows, {{becoming a}} manager for the great Harrie Rickards, who practically controlled the variety stage in Australia until 1911. Harrie Skinner piloted such celebrities as the US Minstrels, Ada Ward and Millie Walton and the Fakir of Oolu (actually an English magician called Sylvester, who performed Indian-style <b>levitations).</b> It is likely that Harrie introduced the gramophone to Sydney with a stage performance in mind - the first gramophones were pitted against live musicians in theatre.|$|R
50|$|Mirabelli {{was born}} in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, of Italian parents. He studied Spiritism {{at an early age}} and was {{introduced}} to the writings of Allan Kardec. As a teenager he worked in a shoe shop and claimed to have experienced poltergeist activity where shoe boxes would literally fly off the shelves. He was placed in an lunatic asylum for observation and psychologists said {{there was something wrong with}} him, but he was not physically sick. Mirabelli later became a medium and it was alleged he could produce automatic handwriting, materializations of objects and people (ectoplasm), <b>levitations</b> and movement of objects.|$|R
5000|$|After {{two years}} {{investigation}} into automatic writing {{he wrote that}} the subconscious mind is the explanation {{and there is no}} evidence for the spirit hypothesis. Flammarion believed in the survival of the soul after death but wrote that mediumship had not been scientifically proven. Even though Flammarion believed in the survival of the soul after death he did not believe in the spirit hypothesis of Spiritism, instead he believed that Spiritist activities such as ectoplasm and <b>levitations</b> of objects could be explained by an unknown [...] "psychic force" [...] from the medium. He also believed that telepathy could explain some paranormal phenomena.|$|R
