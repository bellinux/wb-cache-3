50|$|This walk can be {{illustrated}} as follows. A marker is placed at zero {{on the number}} line and a fair coin is flipped. If it <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> heads, the marker is moved one unit to the right. If it <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> tails, the marker is moved one unit to the left. After five flips, the marker could now be on 1, −1, 3, −3, 5, or −5. With five flips, three heads and two tails, in any order, will <b>land</b> <b>on</b> 1. There are 10 ways of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 1 (by flipping three heads and two tails), 10 ways of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −1 (by flipping three tails and two heads), 5 ways of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 3 (by flipping four heads and one tail), 5 ways of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −3 (by flipping four tails and one head), 1 way of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 5 (by flipping five heads), and 1 way of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −5 (by flipping five tails). See the figure below for an illustration of the possible outcomes of 5 flips.|$|R
5|$|On 19August 1942, while British {{commando}} units attacked bunker {{positions on}} the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated {{at the foot of a}} sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders.

50|$|This {{relation}} with Pascal's triangle is demonstrated for small values of n. At zero turns, the only possibility {{will be to}} remain at zero. However, at one turn, there is one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −1 or one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 1. At two turns, a marker at 1 could move to 2 or back to zero. A marker at −1, could move to −2 or back to zero. Therefore, there is one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −2, two chances of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> zero, and one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 2.|$|R

50|$|The Huygens probe, {{carried to}} Saturn's moon Titan by the Cassini, was {{specifically}} designed to survive <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and <b>on</b> liquid. It was thoroughly drop-tested {{to make sure it}} could withstand impact and continue functioning for at least three minutes. However, due to the low speed impact, it continued providing data {{for more than two hours}} after it <b>landed.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> Titan in 2005 was the first <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> planet's satellites outside the Moon.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> Electric Company, Income Tax, Jail/Just Visiting, Go to Jail, Water Works, or Luxury Tax {{does not}} count towards any prize.

When all properties of a colored set are collected, the user wins a prize, with prize values {{similar to those of}} the sticker game. In addition to collecting property sets, users can also win by <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> certain [...] "instant win" [...] spaces, including Go, Chance, Community Chest, and Free Parking. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> Go (but not simply passing it) gives the player a code worth one free hour of WiFi access at participating McDonald's restaurants. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> Chance is worth money to spend at Foot Locker. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> Community Chest allows the user to be given a code worth 25 My Coke Rewards points. <b>Landing</b> <b>on</b> Free Parking is a prize of a $50 refillable gas card from Shell, or alternatively 25 complimentary apple pies.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even {{on a flat surface}} it {{is possible}} for a coin to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|R

5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
