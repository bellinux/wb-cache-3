This of course captures those that pay and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by {{the large number of}} government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this {{is to be able to}} attract the right skills though the cost of living is high so it balances this out.

In an interview, Hensleigh also stated the film pays homage to Mad Max and William Shakespeare's Othello, though while he was inspired by Othello, the characters were reversed for the film, making the Punisher the instigator of the jealousy which leads to Howard Saint murdering his best friend and wife.|$|R

Following one such defeat on the April 29 episode of SmackDown!, Gunn became angry at X-Pac. The following week on Sunday Night Heat, he apologized to X-Pac, but attacked him when X-Pac's back was turned, citing his frustration at being [...] "held back" [...] and departing from D-Generation X, therefore reducing the members to just Road Dogg and X-Pac. Over the following weeks, Gunn would continue to attack X-Pac and Road Dogg, often being chased away by Kane. In July, Triple H and Chyna told Billy Gunn that Road Dogg and X-Pac were making a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> from D-Generation X's royalties than the other three (due to them still using the name as a tag team).

[...] For Pierre, the album came at {{the brink of a}} transitional period for him, in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about new energy for the group, according to Pierre. Commit This to Memory would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band had more time and funds to spend time working on the album.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{rationales}} behind having P3s in Canada {{as an alternative}} form of service delivery. Overall, Having P3s are meant to produce more gain rather than loss, whether economic or societal. The idea of having the private sector involved in infrastructure {{could result in a}} higher level of production quality without incurring further immediate debt directly to the government. In most projects, financial responsibility is put more on the private sector side of P3s, but in some instances, investment {{at the beginning of a}} project can be shared. Some P3 projects (ex. 407 highway in Ontario) have potential for user fee charges or other revenue related options, which could be used to pay back initial investment by the private sector. Another rational the private sector aspect of P3s would bring the core value of decentralization to the decision making and project planning process. This could result in a method that is more efficient due to less immediate control from public sector factors. Having the involvement of the private sector also brings new innovation and risk management tactics that are used in the private sector, as a result of private market forces involved. Having the private sector involved can create a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> value for <b>money</b> in the public interest by blending public sector values with private sector values such as lifecycle asset management, private operation management, and private sector strategy. These were some of the original rationales for having P3 projects in Canada.|$|R

He preserved his serene, gentle, expression, I am told (for I have not witnessed those scenes myself), and {{looked around at the}} people with an air of placid sufficiency which was the first hint {{to the world of the}} man's overweening, immeasurable conceit, hidden hitherto under a diffident manner. It could be seen too in his dogged assertion that if he had been given enough time and a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> everything would have come right. And there were some people (yes, amongst his very victims) who more than half believed him, even after the criminal prosecution which soon followed. When placed in the dock he lost his steadiness as if some sustaining illusion had gone to pieces within him suddenly. He ceased to be himself in manner completely, and even in disposition, in so far that his faded neutral eyes matching his discoloured hair so well, were discovered then to be capable of expressing a sort of underhand hate. He was at first defiant, then insolent, then broke down and burst into tears; but it might have been from rage. Then he calmed down, returned to his soft manner of speech and to that unassuming quiet bearing which had been usual with him even in his greatest days. But it seemed as though in this moment of change he had at last perceived what a power he had been; for he remarked to one of the prosecuting counsel who had assumed a lofty moral tone in questioning him, that--yes, he had gambled--he liked cards. But that only a year ago a host of smart people would have been only too pleased to take a hand at cards with him. Yes--he went on--some of the very people who were there accommodated with seats on the bench; and turning upon the counsel, [...] "You yourself as well," [...] he cried.

6000|$|Soames {{passed into}} the corner where, side by side, hung his real Goya and the copy of the fresco [...] "La Vendimia." [...] His {{acquisition}} of the real Goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested interests and passions which mesh the bright-winged fly of human life. The real Goya's noble owner's ancestor had come into possession of it during some Spanish war--it was in a word loot. The noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a Spanish painter named Goya was a genius. It was only a fair Goya, but almost unique in England, and the noble owner became a marked man. Having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which, independent of mere sensuous enjoyment, is founded on the sounder principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested in life, he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed to his reputation while he was alive, and to {{leave it to the}} nation after he was dead. Fortunately for Soames, the House of Lords was violently attacked in 1909, and the noble owner became alarmed and angry. 'If,' he said to himself, 'they think they can have it both ways they are very much mistaken. So long as they leave me in quiet enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death. But if the nation is going to bait me, and rob me like this, I'm damned if I won't sell the lot. They can't have my private property and my public spirit-both.' He brooded in this fashion for several months till one morning, after reading the speech of a certain statesman, he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring Bodkin. On going over the collection Bodkin, than whose opinion on market values none was more sought, pronounced that with a free hand to sell to America, Germany, and other places where there was an interest in art, a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> could be made than by selling in England. The noble owner's public spirit--he said--was well known but the pictures were unique. The noble owner put this opinion in his pipe and smoked it for a year. At the end of that time he read another speech by the same statesman, and telegraphed to his agents: [...] "Give Bodkin a free hand." [...] It was at this juncture that Bodkin conceived the idea which saved the Goya and two other unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner. With one hand Bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market, with the other he formed a list of private British collectors. Having obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across the seas, he submitted pictures and bids to the private British collectors, and invited them, of their public spirit, to outbid. In three instances (including the Goya) out of twenty-one he was successful. And why? One of the private collectors made buttons--he had made so many that he desired that his wife should be called Lady [...] "Buttons." [...] He therefore bought a unique picture at great cost, and gave it to the nation. It was [...] "part," [...] his friends said, [...] "of his general game." [...] The second of the private collectors was an Americophobe, and bought an unique picture to [...] "spite the damned Yanks." [...] The third of the private collectors was Soames, who--more sober than either of the, others--bought after a visit to Madrid, because he was certain that Goya was still on the up grade. Goya was not booming at the moment, but he would come again; and, looking at that portrait, Hogarthian, Manetesque in its directness, but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint, he was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error, heavy though the price had been--heaviest he had ever paid. And next to it was hanging the copy of [...] "La Vendimia." [...] There she was--the little wretch--looking back at him in her dreamy mood, the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she looked like that.|$|E
