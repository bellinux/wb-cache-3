5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, a <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, for both men and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E

5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel <b>Labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> Evil.|$|E

Progression is largely nonlinear and the game allows for emergent gameplay.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and <b>Labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

5|$|Belgicas voyage {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of {{what became known as the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly followed by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gjøa, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers.|$|E
5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
