25|$|In modern radio systems, {{modulated}} {{signals are}} generated via {{digital signal processing}} (DSP). With DSP many types of AM are possible with software control (including DSB with carrier, SSB suppressed-carrier and independent sideband, or ISB). Calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a digital-to-analog converter, typically at a frequency less than the desired RF-output frequency. The analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and linearly amplified to the desired frequency and power level (<b>linear</b> <b>amplification</b> must be used to prevent modulation distortion).|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep sampling of the transcriptome with many short fragments from a transcriptome to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (nanogram quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with <b>linear</b> <b>amplification</b> of cDNA. Theoretically, there is no upper limit of quantification in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E

30|$|TTAS is {{independent}} of the content or complexity of template sequences. DNA fragments are tailed nonspecifically by TdT to form poly-A tails for binding future primers. In the PCR step, the primers bind to the universal sequences that were introduced during two rounds of <b>linear</b> <b>amplifications.</b> This design guarantees uniform amplification across the whole genome and also endows TTAS a versatile method to amplify different types of DNA material. The tailing strategy also preserves the sequence information of the ends of DNA fragments. These regions are particularly desired for some short DNA sequencing applications, such as the identification of DNA damage hotspots and DNA replication stalling sites (Zhou et al., 2013).|$|R

In particular, the stability of nonlinear structures which develop in rotating plane Couette flow is analyzed using Floquet theory, which allows the global stability of an important secondary nonlinear structure called a Taylor vortex to be determined. From this the distinct tertiary states which emerge as Taylor vortices break down are characterized and their bifurcation behaviour is studied. Also, non-modal stability analyses are conducted in rotating plane Couette flow and annular Poiseuille-Couette flow.

Digital information can be transmitted by AM and FM modulation, but often digital modulation consists of complex forms of modulation using aspects of both AM and FM. COFDM is used for DRM broadcasts.

In this study, to properly evaluate this issue, we performed 1 round of <b>linear</b> RNA <b>amplification</b> in 2 breast cell lines (C 5. 2 and HB 4 a) and assessed the relative expression of 34 genes using cDNA converted from both nonamplified (NA) and A RNA. Relative gene expression was obtained from beta actin or glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase normalized data using different dilutions of cDNA, wherein the variability and fold-change differences in the expression of the 2 methods were compared. Our data showed that 1 round of <b>linear</b> RNA <b>amplification,</b> even with suboptimal-quality RNA, is appropriate to generate reproducible and high-fidelity qRT-PCR relative expression data that have similar confidence levels as those from NA samples.
