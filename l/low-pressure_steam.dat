5|$|Steam engines {{appeared}} in the United States {{as a source of}} power in the late 18th century, and living in Delaware and Philadelphia meant Evans was exposed to early examples of their application there. John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two <b>low-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E
5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using <b>low-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, the Solar Energy Research Institute (now {{known as}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) {{developed}} a vertical-spout evaporator to convert warm seawater into <b>low-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> for open-cycle plants. Conversion efficiencies were as high as 97% for seawater-to-steam conversion (overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water). In May 1993, an open-cycle OTEC plant at Keahole Point, Hawaii, produced close to 80 kW of electricity during a net power-producing experiment. This broke the record of 40kW set by a Japanese system in 1982.|$|E

2500|$|A {{fundamental}} change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt. With financial support from his business partner Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, thereby making the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber. [...] The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam. [...] Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency. [...] These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20â25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of the potential benefits arising from the integration of Ultra Super Critical (USC) steam power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and concentrating solar systems. In particular, it reports on a comparative performance analysis of different integrating approaches, based on the design of the solar field to produce <b>low-pressure</b> saturated <b>steam</b> for the CCS solvent regeneration process and intermediate-pressure saturated and superheated steam for the introduction in the steam cycle. For the two different technical solutions, the comparative study calculates the increase in the annual energy production and net efficiency due to the solar energy contribution as a function of solar field size and for two different CO 2 removal efficiencies. The study demonstrates that the integration of concentrating solar collectors can partially offset the efficiency penalties due to CO 2 removal in USC power plants and that the most efficient approach is based on the production of superheated steam while lesser benefits can be achieved by producing <b>low-pressure</b> saturated <b>steam</b> for the solvent regeneration process. It also demonstrates that the introduction of the steam produced by the solar field greatly affects the performance of the power plant that operates in an "off design" mode. For this reason, to avoid an excessive increase in the turbine steam mass flow, the solar energy contribution to the annual electricity production cannot exceed 2 - 3 %. Overall, integration with the solar section can improve the efficiency of the USC-CCS power plant by about 1 percentage point. Finally, the results of a preliminary economic analysis show that the solar assisted USC-CCS configuration may be able to operate with competitive solar energy production costs, especially with reduced solar field costs. In particular, the marginal levelized energy production cost of the most efficient solar assisted USC-CCS configuration is lower than that of the reference USC-CCS power plant for solar field costs lower than 110 - 115 â¬/m 2...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{study the effects of}} drying methods and {{conditions}} (i. e., ambient drying, hot air drying at 40 degrees C, vacuum drying and <b>low-pressure</b> superheated <b>steam</b> drying within the temperature range of 70 - 90 degrees C at an absolute pressure of 10 kPa) as well as the concentration of galangal extract on the antimicrobial activity of edible chitosan films against Staphylococcus aureus. Galangal extract was added to the film forming solution as a natural antimicrobial agent in the concentration range of 0. 3 - 0. 9 g/ 100 g. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and swelling of the films were also evaluated to investigate interaction between chitosan and the galangal extract. The antimicrobial activity of the films was evaluated by the disc diffusion and viable cell count method, while the morphology of bacteria treated with the antimicrobial films was observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antimicrobial activity, swelling and functional group interaction of the antimicrobial films were found to be affected by the drying methods and conditions as well as the concentration of the galangal extract. The electron microscopic observations revealed that cell wall and cell membrane of S. aureus treated by the antimicrobial films were significantly damaged. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
