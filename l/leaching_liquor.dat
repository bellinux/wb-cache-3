2500|$|Solvent {{extraction}} – electrowinning (often {{referred to}} as [...] "SX–EW") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore.

The copper ions in the <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> transfer to the organic extractant, moving from a relatively low concentration to a higher concentration.

Vanadium (V) extraction from the simulated high-acidity <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor</b> with numerous impurities using a mixed extractant consisting of tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336) and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) was studied while obvious synergism was found. According to synergistic enhancement coefficient and physical property of organic phase, the suitable extractant composition was the volume ratio of Aliquat 336 to TBP 1 : 4. The vanadium (V) extraction increased sharply as HCL concentration increased from 1. 01 mol/L to 4. 13 mol/L. Under the optimum extraction conditions (extractant concentration of 50 vol%, 1 min, 25 - 30 degrees C, and phase ratio (O/A) of 1 : 1), the vanadium extraction with three stages was above 90. 0 %. Almost no other impurity ions, such as Ca, Al, Mg, Cr, Ti, Mn, and Si, were co-extracted. Under the optimum stripping conditions, the vanadium stripping was above 92. 0 % {{in a single}} stage using water as the effective stripping reagent. High quality V 2 O 5 product was obtained after precipitation and calcination. The mechanism of vanadium (V) extraction by Aliquat 336 -TBP mixed extractant was discussed based on the analysis of Ft-IR and UV-vis spectra. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this study, a novel isopentyl sulfide (S 201) -impregnated α-MnO 2 nanorod adsorbent (BISIN) was prepared, characterized, and applied for the selective adsorption and separation of palladium from the <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor</b> of ores. Batch studies were carried out, and the main adsorption parameters were systematically investigated, {{in addition to the}} relevant thermodynamic parameters, isotherms, and kinetic models. The thermodynamic parameters reflected the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the adsorption. Moreover, the experimental results indicated that the Langmuir isotherm model fits the palladium adsorption data well and the adsorption was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The main adsorption mechanisms of palladium were elucidated at the molecular level by X-ray crystal structure analysis. Thiourea was found to be an excellent desorption agent, and the palladium-thiourea complex was also confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. The results indicated that almost all of the Pd(II) (> 99. 0 %) is adsorbed on BISIN, whereas less than 2 % of the adsorbed Pt(IV), Fe 3 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 +, and Co 2 + is observed under the optimum conditions.

In the alkali decomposition step, the effects of reaction time, NH 4 OH concentration, liquid/solid mass ratio and reaction temperature on the decomposition process are investigated to remove Al, Cu, Mn, Ni, Co, and Li. After alkaline treatment, the alkali paste is treated to leach the remaining metals using H 2 SO 4 +H 2 O 2. The significant effects of reaction time, acid concentration, H 2 O 2 concentration, liquid/solid mass ratios and reaction temperature on the leaching rate are studied. More than 97 % of Al, Mn, Ni, Co, and Li and about 65 % Cu are leached in two stages. Kinetic analysis shows that, the data fit with chemical reaction control mechanism and the activation energies for the investigated metals using the Arrhenius equation ranged from 30. 1 to 41. 4 kJ/mol. Recovered metals are precipitated from the <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor</b> at varying pH values using NaOH solution and Na 2 CO 3. Firstly, Mn is precipitated as MnCO 3 at pH= 7. 5.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to present the {{possibilities}} of copper(II) recovery from the synthetic sulphate <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> containing cobalt(II), nickel(II) and manganese(II). Design/methodology/approach: The investigations have been undertaken in order to determine the influence of major parameters on the extraction process of copper(II) from the <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> of polymetallic manganese nodules. Copper(II) ions were extracted with Kelex 100 and LIX 70 in kerosene. The effect of different parameters such as pH of aqueous phase, extractants concentration in the organic phase, concentration of sulphuric acid as the stripping reagent were investigated. Findings: The optimal conditions of metal ions selectivity extraction have been determined. Over 99 % of Cu(II) can be effectively extracted with 5 % Kelex 100 and 10 % LIX 70 at pH of 2. 0 from model <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> in the presence of Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II), while less than 10 % of the other metals is transported to the organic phase. The selectivity of Cu(II) extraction over Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II) with Kelex 100 depended upon the acidity of aqueous solution and the selectivity increased with decreasing of pH in the feed solution. Separation of Cu(II) from these metal ions is very effective. Cu(II) can be recovered successfully from the loaded organic phase with Kelex 100 through stripping with 2. 0 M H 2 SO 4. Practical implications: The results can be used during the hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from nodules on the industrial scale. Originality/value: The study on the solvent extraction of Cu(II) using LIX 70 and Kelex 100 from <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> of polymetallic manganese nodules has not been reported yet.

Introdutory experiments were carried out to get <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> solution: oxidation/roasting, acid leaching, and precipitation methods implemented for PMSs dissolution. The obtained PMSs <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> was diluted ten times and used for present study. Di- 2 -ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) was used as an extractant for recovery of the REs and kerosene as diluent system. The present study optimized the various experimental parameters such as the time influence on extraction process, influence of pH, extractant concentration, separation factors calculated, scrubbing, stripping, maximum loading capacity of the extractant, and various phase ratios as well as phase ratios influence on present metals separations. Loading capacity of D 2 EHPA and selective stripping process were developed for targeted metal ions by using various mineral acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids. The metal content analysis in the aqueous samples was determined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP OES) for sensitive and accurate data...|$|R

40|$|Municipal Solid Waste combustion, {{as one of}} {{the waste}} {{management}} tools, starts {{to play an important role}} nowadays in heat and energy generation. However, MSW combustion leads to generation of other wastes - combustion residues, including ashes, which require a proper management. Thus, a lot of efforts have been directed towards minimization or elimination of negative impact on the environment when ash is land filled or utilized and thus different treatment options for fly ashes are presently being tested. This study is focused on testing a treatment method for cyclone ash from MSW combustion in Bubbling Fluidised Bed Boiler. The proposed method is based on effective leaching of the ash with water to release easily soluble salts, mainly NaCl and KCl, from the ash. The leaching step is followed by filtration and washing. The study was carried out in two stages: laboratory scale experiments and pilot plant scale experiments. The washing process tested under laboratory conditions consisted of the following steps: the cyclone ash and de-ionized water was mixed in a leaching reactor and after a specified residence time, the slurry was filtered and finally washed with de-ionized water in a filtration unit. The laboratory tests provided necessary data for continuation of the research in the pilot plant scale. The pilot plant consisted of a leaching unit, a filtration/washing unit, a storage tank and an ash bin. The whole washing process, except for the filtration step, was working in continuous mode. The findings from the research show that the proposed treatment process works very well for this type of ash. The leaching with water results in a relatively quick release of soluble salts from the ash. The ash/water slurry seemed to be a suitable material for mechanical separation in the filter unit, independently of the L/S slurry ratio applied. The mother liquor (<b>leaching</b> <b>liquor)</b> trapped in the filter cake can be washed out by displacement washing using a water volume twice is the volume of the mother liquor. Thus, an overall liquid to solid ratio at 1 seems to be reasonable low and still sufficient to reduce the leaching of soluble components from the washed ash. At this liquid to solid ratio the <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor</b> is still far from being saturated in respect to NaCl and KCl. The cyclone ash washed in the pilot plant passed two leaching tests (batch leaching test and the column test) that are proposed as European standard methods for the evaluation of particulate waste...|$|E
40|$|Cobalt {{is a very}} {{important}} metal which is widely applied in various critical areas, however, it is difficult to recover cobalt from minerals since {{there is a lack of}} independent cobalt deposits in nature. This work is to provide a complete process to recover cobalt from cobalt tailings using the moderately thermophilic bioleaching technology and selective sequential extraction. It is found that 96. 51 % Co and 26. 32 % Cu were extracted after bioleaching for four days at 10 % pulp density. The mean compositions of the leach solutions contain 0. 98 g·L− 1 of Co, 6. 52 g·L− 1 of Cu, and 24. 57 g·L− 1 of Fe (III). The copper ion was then recovered by a solvent extraction process and the ferric ions were selectively removed by applying a goethite deironization process. The technological conditions of the above purification procedures were deliberately discussed. Over 98. 6 % of copper and 99. 9 % of ferric ions were eliminated from the <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor.</b> Cobalt was finally produced as cobalt oxalate and its overall recovery during the whole process was greater than 95 %. The present bioleaching process of cobalt is worth using for reference to deal with low-grade cobalt ores...|$|E
40|$|Bioleaching liquors usually contain low {{concentration}} valuable {{metals and}} a major impurity (magnesium or calcium), and therefore it is a heavy burden and involves a complicated process to separate and enrich valuable metals from these liquors. An alternative process of selective precipitation of metals using H 2 S produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) is put forward. In this paper, sealed flasks were used to study the influence of Mg 2 + {{in the form of}} MgCl 2 center dot 6 H(2) O and MgSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O on the growth and activity of SRB, and the sulfide precipitation of bioleaching liquors was also studied. The experimental results show that Mg 2 + ion concentration from MgCl 2 center dot 6 H(2) O or MgSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O is a significant and favorable factor for SRB growth and activity. It is also demonstrated that enhanced activation of SRB by adding NaCl in liquor and the SRB have a high tolerance to salinity from NaCl. Adding MgSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O provides a predominant condition for SRB growth, due to providing higher concentration of sulfate. The sulfide precipitation and separation of magnesium with H 2 S produced by SRB is found to be mainly dependent on the pH value and the H 2 S concentration. SRB culture solution can effectively precipitate Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + and Fe 3 + from synthetic <b>leaching</b> <b>liquor</b> in 2 min, while Mg 2 + ions remain in the liquid phase. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

Adsorption onto activated carbon {{was used to}} separate molybdenum from other metals contained in these <b>leach</b> <b>liquors,</b> namely nickel, cobalt and vanadium. Kinetic tests using Mo-bearing solutions denoted {{that the rate of}} adsorption depends on the amount of Mo in solution with an estimated order of reaction of 0. 9 +/- 0. 3. Equilibrium sorption tests showed that metal accumulation presents a bell-shaped behaviour as pH changes with a maximum sorption capacity around pH 5. Preliminary test in column reactor fed with Mo-bearing solution confirmed the sorption capacity estimated in batch tests (0. 230 g/g). Sorption tests in batch reactors using <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> ([Mo] = 3. 06 g/L, [V] = 5. 84 g/L, [Ni] = 4. 48 g/L, [Al] = 1. 77 g/L) denoted that Mo can be quantitatively and selectively removed from solution (99 % removal for Mo, 24 +/- 2 % for Al, 19 % for V and 0 % for Ni) with no significant reduction of sorption capacity towards Mo (0. 250 g/g). Preliminary sorption-desorption cycles denoted that Mo removal was larger than 90 % in each cycle, whilst the other metals were minimally removed (Al and V) or completely rejected (Ni).
