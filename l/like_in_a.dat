5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, <b>like</b> , <b>in</b> <b>a</b> science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (<b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E

25|$|When tuning {{instruments}} {{that can produce}} sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible.|$|E

25|$|The RLI {{carried out}} {{external}} assaults on guerrilla bases in Zambia (against ZIPRA) and Mozambique (against ZANLA); {{there were many}} of these, and also one in Botswana. The larger raids combined Fireforce teams and were similarly executed, save for the greater scale of planning and logistics. There were also several raids by individual Commandos where the presence of FRELIMO units led to greater resistance. Just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular Fireforce operation, {{the element of surprise}} was most important.|$|E
25|$|Kojima's love of film is {{noticeable}} in his games {{where he}} pays homage through his stories and characters, sometimes {{to the point}} of pastiche, as in Snatcher. He cited a contrast between films and games as while in his games he intends to portray violence <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie, in the game {{it is up to the}} player to decide. He wants people to understand the effects of violence. As he considers the games too stressful, he also wants comic relief to contrast it.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the right}} side of the {{instrument}} panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing RS-232 serial communication, into which a computer can be plugged into to download engine monitoring information. The software to run this is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> digital camera, and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E

5000|$|A {{secondary}} {{element of}} the game is FPS-style sniping, when the player's helicopter enters [...] "stealth mode" [...] the autocannon is used as a precision sniper weapon {{that can be used to}} accurately target individual soldiers, allowing the player to snipe enemy infantry much <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> FPS.|$|R
25|$|In the {{circumflex}} {{cases the}} second element is emphasized and lengthened. But for the mixed diphthongs, the circumflex variant {{can also be}} pronounced without an emphasis and be understood only as shortness of a first element of a diphthong (in contrast to the acute, where the first element lengthens) in a standard language. In some cases, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> word oppositional to várna 'crow': var̃nas 'raven', the r would occur more likely emphasized, than not. But in some, for example, var̃das 'name', it can occur either emphasized, or not (so {{that it would be}} understood by some as vàrdas in the latter case). Such pronunciation and understanding of a circumflex diphthong being more some like without emphasis of any of its two elements, but some like a shortness of a first element, could also fit for aũ, aĩ, eĩ diphthongs, but an emphasis of the second element (similarly to the acute case, where the first element is emphasized) is characteristic for them too. The first element of circumflex cases is similar to a short unstressed vowel – not tensed, more closed. In an aũ case a vowel a receives a slight o shade (becomes narrower).|$|E
25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{movements of}} the dolphin kick and flutter kick are {{in contrast to the}} breaststroke whip kick, which really deserves the name kick. Scissor kick and frog kick are intermediate. Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, {{at the end of the}} kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on knee at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and feeling for the beginner and to wear for the senior.|$|E
25|$|In {{selective}} schools, various languages may {{be offered}} as electives <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> SPFL program, {{as well as}} other subjects such as computer programming and literary writing like in STEM schools or Laboratory High Schools. Chinese schools have language and cultural electives. International Schools offers electives or subjects like writing, culture, history, language, art, or a special subject unique to the school. Preparatory schools like technical vocational schools or schools with TVL Program usually add some business, entrepreneurship, and accountancy courses. Special science high schools like those of PSHS System (administered by DOST) and RSHS System (administered by DepEd) have biology, chemistry, and physics at every level and or exclusive and advanced science and math subjects as well as subjects in technology, pre-engineering, and research. These science schools are more exclusive and with higher standards compared to general high school's STEM Program. PSHS or RSHS students may transfer to a STEM program school but not the way around. PSHS students may also transfer to a RSHS and vice versa only for incoming sophomore year. Both PSHS and RSHS students must maintain an average grade especially in their advanced sciences and math subjects on a quarterly basis or else will lose the chance of continuing education in these schools, therefore, will make students transfer to a STEM Program school or a general high school. This systems makes sure the quality and exclusiveness of science high schools. In special government-run art school such as Philippine High School for the Arts, which is administered by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in coordination with Department of Education, and as well as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts offers a much specialized and exclusive curricular program than general high school's SPA Program. Like the PSHS and RSHS to STEM schools system, students from PHSA should maintain grades in their art field of specialization or will transfer to an SPA school or a general high school. But SPA students can enroll in PHSA only for incoming sophomores passing exclusive test, auditions, and interviews, and not from general high schools but from SPA school only. Both schools of Philippine Science High School System and the Philippine High School for the Arts are administered by government agencies apart from DepEd but still is in coordination with it. These schools offers scholarship for students with high aptitude and talents in science fields or the art fields granting those who passes rigorous and exclusive tests with many special benefits like free board and lodging, free books, a monthly stipend, and classes taught by experts, masters, and active practitioners of their respective fields among others.|$|E

500|$|A single [...] {{diameter}} subwoofer {{driver was}} designed by Richard Clark and David Navone {{with the help of}} Dr. Eugene Patronis of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The driver was intended to break sound pressure level records when mounted in a road vehicle, calculated to be able to achieve more than 180dBSPL. It was built in 1997, driven by DC motors connected to a rotary crankshaft somewhat <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> piston engine.

MTX's Loyd Ivey helped underwrite the project and the driver was then called the MTX [...] "Thunder 1000000" [...] (one million).|$|E

During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly.

500|$|The creature's corpse was {{recovered}} {{four days after}} the encounter, and a biopsy was performed by the National Environmental Authority of Panama (ANAM). The biopsy concluded that the corpse was in fact a male brown-throated sloth, a species common in the area. André Sena Maia, a veterinarian who works at Niterói Zoo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, explained that [...] "most people know how a dead animal looks <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dry environment", and claimed that [...] "the body must have got stuck under the water, and the movement of the currents gave the false impression that it was alive." [...] A necropsy revealed that severe trauma had been inflicted on the body of the sloth, and Melquiades Ramos, a specialist from the ANAM Department of Protected Areas, estimated that the body had been in the water for [...] "about two days" [...] prior to discovery. The hairlessness was probably caused by the fact it was submerged in water, which can lead to acceleration of fur loss, resulting in smooth skin. A post-mortem bloating further contributed to the unusual appearance of the corpse. After the sloth was identified, its body was buried by ANAM staff.|$|E
