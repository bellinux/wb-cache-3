40|$|Abstract. A new PCD {{material}} named EC-PCD (Electrically conductive polycrystalline composite diamond), {{which consists}} of electrically conductive diamond grits, has recently been developed. This paper deals with an investigation of a complex grinding assisted with electrical discharge machining (EDM) to realize high efficiency, low and stable grinding force and low wheel wear for the new EC-PCD. The effect of complex grinding assisted with EDM is compared experimentally with the standard PCD (S-PCD). The result shows that, in the complex grinding, lower and more stable grinding force is realized thanks to the material removal action in EDM and that <b>lower</b> <b>wheel</b> wear and better surface finish are attained, just when the EC-PCD is selected as a workpiece...|$|E

Only after block brakes have been either removed or optimized will the rail require any attention. An exception to this rule is rail corrugation, which was found to occur locally.

The essence of the measurement was gradual shortening of the upper linkage of the three-point hitch, whereas simultaneously with shortening of the linkage, the force on the linkage was rising. The force was measured by means of strain gauge Hotinger U 2 A. In case of the mounted plough it has been proved that shortening of the upper linkage causes rising of the force.

40|$|The work {{describes}} the {{programme of activities}} relating to a mechanical study of the Conform extrusion process. The main objective {{was to provide a}} basic understanding of the mechanics of the Conform process with particular emphasis placed on modelling using experimental and theoretical considerations. The experimental equipment used includes a state of the art computer-aided data-logging system and high temperature loadcells (up to 260 oC) manufactured from tungsten carbide. Full details of the experimental equipment is presented in sections 3 and 4. A theoretical model is given in Section 5. The model presented is based on the upper bound theorem using a variation of the existing extrusion theories combined with temperature changes in the feed metal across the deformation zone. In addition, constitutive equations used in the model have been generated from existing experimental data. Theoretical and experimental data are presented in tabular form in Section 6. The discussion of results includes a comprehensive graphical presentation of the experimental and theoretical data. The main findings are: (i) the establishment of stress/strain relationships and an energy balance in order to study the factors affecting redundant work, and hence a model suitable for design purposes; (ii) optimisation of the process, by determination of the extrusion pressure for the range of reduction and changes in the extrusion chamber geometry at <b>lower</b> <b>wheel</b> speeds; and (iii) an understanding of the control of the peak temperature reach during extrusion...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{and discusses}} results of subsoil stress, strain and strength measurements during field traffic with several load intensities on five sites in Sweden {{during the growing}} season. Vertical subsoil stress and displacement were measured by installing sensors horizontally 1 m into the soil at 0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7 m depth through holes drilled from a pit whereby the soil flanking the sensors was left undisturbed. The soil precompression stress was determined on each occasion by sequential loading of soil samples in the laboratory. The topsoil properties had a large impact on the vertical subsoil stress, and the concentration of stress below a loaded surface appears {{to be affected by}} topsoil characteristics quite different than normally anticipated. The stress was clearly transmitted more directly and undiminished in relatively dry soil than in relatively wet soil. The precompression stress as determined by classical, uniaxial compression tests was a poor measure of soil ability to sustain non-recoverable deformation. The study showed that plastic deformation occurred at stress levels far below that predicted by the precompression stress. A linear correlation between elastic (recoverable) and plastic (non-recoverable) soil deformation indicates that soil should be regarded as an assemblage of soil elements with a stochastic distribution of the strength of the contact points. The practical implication of the observed soil behaviour is that the subsoil appears to be vulnerable to plastic (non-recoverable) deformation at <b>lower</b> <b>wheel</b> loads than normally anticipated. Furthermore, {{it is important that the}} stress in the contact area is as evenly distributed as possible to avoid unnecessarily high peak stresses. This calls for relatively fast and reliable methods that enable the land-users to optimise the stress distribution below tyres or tracks for specific soil types, water content and field operation. Furthermore, the results suggests an urgent need for engineering developments in vehicles with small load intensities...|$|E
