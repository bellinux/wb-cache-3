40|$|M. Comm. The for-profit {{business}} must maximise owners' wealth {{over the}} long term. It is accomplished by legally structuring the lease to minimise <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Accounting profits and <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> arising from the lease are determined in different ways: different lease structures could result in similar accounting profits, but different <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> A lease's accounting profits may be preestimated with relative certainty, but it's difficult to pre-estimate its <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> It's especially difficult with long-term leases that stretch {{over a number of}} accounting periods and tax years. There isn't a specific framework with which <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> arising from the lease of immovable property may be determined and minimised. This study focuses on determining and minimising income <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> {{within the context of the}} leasing of immovable property in South Africa. The workings of the factors that give rise to the <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> are distinguished. Different types oflease agreements, reflecting the commercial objectives, are identified. A framework is then constructed from these factors to simplizy determination of the <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> and to structure the lease so that <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> may be reduced. The different types of lease agreements are imposed on the framework to subordinate the reduction of <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> to the parties' commercial objectives...|$|R

Since distributions reduce future shareholder <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> hypothesis implies that closed-end fund discounts should decline following distributions. Focusing on changes in discounts isolates this tax effect by eliminating the impact of other fund-specific factors on discount levels. Our results support the <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> hypothesis, showing that short-run fluctuations in discounts are directly affected by taxable distributions.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of tax data {{is a time}} intensive and complicated process. Much time and effort are spent collecting income and tax data, compiling data sets and running statistical analyses. However, it appears that relatively little time and effort are spent actually understanding the data {{and how best to}} present results to the public of analyses of using tax data. This is evident in the overuse of averages and the simplistic classification of taxpayers into income ranges and quintiles by tax distribution tables that are often highly publicized. This study shows that the link between income and <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> is much more tenuous that that often presumed and that a variety of other factors can greatly affect <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Specifically, this report finds that, among other things: • Over 22 percent of all 1995 tax returns claimed zero <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> – For calendar year 2000, the JCT estimates that 48. 7 million out of 140. 2 million taxpayers overall will have zero or negative federal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> •In four out of the five income groups examined, a majority of taxpayers had <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> that were either 25 percent greater than the average or 25 percent less than the average <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> for each income group. • In comparing federal income <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> distribution tables often misclassify and group millions of taxpayers into quintiles in which they have little <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> in common. •Approximately 2. 2 million taxpayers in the third quintile pay more in federal income taxes than 5. 4 million taxpayers classified in the fourth quintile. •Over 3 million taxpayers in the fourth quintile pay more in federal income taxes than 4. 1 million taxpayers classified in the fifth quintile...|$|R

Surprise tax cuts give rise to a large boom in the economy. Anticipated <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> <b>tax</b> cuts are instead associated with a contraction in output, investment and hours worked prior to their implementation. After their implementation, anticipated <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> cuts lead to an economic expansion. We build a DSGE model with changes in tax rates that may be anticipated or not, estimate key parameters using a simulation estimator and show that it can account for the main features of the data. We argue that tax shocks are empirically important for U.

While an area-based {{property tax}} is advocated for its simplicity and transparency, it is often criticized as being unfair because assessed values upon which property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are based {{are not related to}} market values. We present a case study in Lithuania that explores the uniformity of assessments, and thus the implications for fairness of the distribution of property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> across properties, for an area-based tax as opposed to an ad�valorem property tax. The findings suggest that, in Lithuania, assessments are more uniform, and the distribution of property <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> across properties are more fair, for detached housing under the area-based assessment than under the market-based assessment; alternatively, uniformity and fairness of the distribution of <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> for flats are better under market-based than area-based assessment. ...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Around April to June each year, many South Africans have to {{deal with}} their {{personal}} income <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> for that year. These are times of uncertainty to many of these people due to their lack of knowledge relating to personal income tax. This leads to people running around seeking assistance from friends, or in some cases paying consultants a small fortune, to have their income tax returns handed in before the deadline. If a taxpayer does not have adequate knowledge about taxes, then that person will most probably not know what his <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are and how to legally limit these <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to make the uninformed taxpayer aware of his <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and to assist such a person so that he does not pay more tax than he has to. The literature study deals with a brief overview of the history of taxation, the impact of the national budget on a person's <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and the role of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This portion of the literature study is aimed at giving the uninformed taxpayer a background regarding income tax. The final part of the literature study deals with the calculation of a South African's personal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Although many of the points have been simplified, it is still quite possible that they can be confusing to the uninformed taxpayer. The theory was then used to develop a framework. The purpose of this framework is to assist the uninformed taxpayer to determine the different components of his personal <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> It will also help the taxpayer to understand how complex it would be to complete his own tax return. This would, in turn, assist the taxpayer in deciding whether he should complete is own tax return or whether he should seek advice from someone who has a better understanding of the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a natural person. To test the framework, the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of actual individuals were determined. The results obtained were checked and confirmed as correct. Based on this it was concluded that the framework could be used for the purpose for which it is intended. The fact that the framework is graphic and a step-by-step guide, it can be used by the uninformed taxpayer to determine his own personal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> The framework is basic and would therefore not be adequate to use in very complex situations. Therefore, further development would be required to deal with such cases...|$|R

50|$|Commissioner v.

However, of course, a single controversial circumstance may have a bearing on income <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> for several years, and if a judgment fixes liability for one of the years, res judiciary forecloses the reopening of only that year's liability. But the related doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues that were in fact raised and decided in the earlier litigation, even when they arise in a new cause of action, such as a dispute as to liability for a later year.|$|R
