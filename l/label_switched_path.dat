50|$|MPLS Fast Reroute (also called MPLS local {{restoration}} or MPLS local protection) {{is a local}} {{restoration network}} resiliency mechanism. It is actually a feature of resource reservation protocol (RSVP) traffic engineering (RSVP-TE). In MPLS local protection each <b>label</b> <b>switched</b> <b>path</b> (LSP) passing through a facility is protected by a backup path which originates at the node immediately upstream to that facility.|$|E
50|$|Routing can {{be subject}} to a set of constraints, such as Quality of Service (QoS), policy, or price. Constraint-based path {{computation}} is a strategic component of traffic engineering in MPLS and GMPLS networks. It is used to determine the path through the network that traffic should follow, and provides the route for each <b>Label</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Path</b> (LSP) that is set up.|$|E
50|$|Characteristics {{determining}} the FEC of a higher-layer packet {{depend on the}} configuration of the router, but typically this is at least the destination IP address. Quality of service class is also often used. Thus, a Forward Equivalence Class tends to correspond to a <b>label</b> <b>switched</b> <b>path</b> (LSP). The reverse is not true, however: an LSP may be (and usually is) used for multiple FECs.|$|E

5000|$|An egress router is a Label Switch Router {{that is an}} {{end point}} (drain) for a given <b>Label</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Path</b> (LSP). An egress router may be an ingress router or an {{intermediate}} router for any other LSP(s). Hence the role of egress and ingress routers is LSP specific. Usually, the MPLS label is attached with an IP packet at the ingress router and removed at the egress router, whereas label swapping is performed on the intermediate routers.|$|E
5000|$|According to RFC 2475 (An Architecture for Differentiated Services, December 1998):"Examples of {{the label}} {{switching}} (or virtual circuit) model include Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS. In this model path forwarding state and traffic management or Quality of Service (QoS) state is established for traffic streams on each hop along a network path. Traffic aggregates of varying granularity {{are associated with a}} <b>label</b> <b>switched</b> <b>path</b> at an ingress node, and packets/cells within each <b>label</b> <b>switched</b> <b>path</b> are marked with a forwarding label that is used to look up the next-hop node, the per-hop forwarding behavior, and the replacement label at each hop. This model permits finer granularity resource allocation to traffic streams, since label values are not globally significant but are only significant on a single link; therefore resources can be reserved for the aggregate of packets/cells received on a link with a particular label, and the label switching semantics govern the next-hop selection, allowing a traffic stream to follow a specially engineered path through the network."A related topic is [...] "Multilayer Switching," [...] which discusses silicon-based wire-speed routing devices that examine not only layer 3 packet information, but also layer 4 (transport) and layer 7 (application) information.|$|E

50|$|It is an {{extension}} of the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), one of the protocols in the Multiprotocol Label Switching architecture. CR-LDP contains extensions for LDP to extend its capabilities such as setup paths beyond what is available for the routing protocol. For instance, a <b>Label</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Path</b> can be set up based on explicit route constraints, quality of service constraints, and other constraints. Constraint-based routing (CR) is a mechanism used to meet traffic engineering requirements. These requirements are met by extending LDP for support of constraint-based routed label switched paths (CR-LSPs). Other uses for CR-LSPs include MPLS-based virtual private networks.CR-LDP is almost same as basic LDP, in packet structure, but it contains some extra TLVs which basically set up the constraint-based LSP.|$|E
5000|$|An [...] "ingress router" [...] is a Label Switch Router {{that is a}} {{starting}} point (source) for a given <b>Label</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Path</b> (LSP).

Usually, the MPLS label is attached with an IP packet at the ingress router and removed at the egress router, whereas label swapping is performed on the intermediate routers. However, in special cases (such as LSP Hierarchy in RFC 4206, LSP Stitching http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-stitching-06 and MPLS local protection) the ingress router could be pushing label in label stack of an already existing MPLS packet (instead of an IP packet).

50|$|In Fig.1 (right), {{there is}} a primary path (<b>Label</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Path,</b> or LSP) from A to E via B and D.

For the primary LSP, FRR (Fast ReRoute) is enabled. Once enabled, the other network elements on the LSP will know that FRR is enabled. Let's assume {{there is a}} break between D and E. D will immediately know this and will inform B and A. For A {{to know that there}} is a failure between D and E takes a while, but since D knows about the failure immediately and FRR is enabled on the LSP, it uses the detour path D-C-E to get rid of the failure immediately and traffic will continue to flow along that new path. This takes less than 50ms. Once the secondary LSP is up, traffic is switched to the secondary LSP and the temporary detour path is disabled.|$|E
