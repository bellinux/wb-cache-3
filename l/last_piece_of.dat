5|$|Slangen, Tivoli Gardens's family roller coaster, {{closed on}} September 21, 2003 {{to make room}} for Dæmonen. Once the roller coaster was demolished, {{construction}} for the new roller coaster commenced. By the beginning of December, most of the brake run and station portions of the track were erected. By the new year, the lift hill was topped off. The first drop was completed by the end of January 2004 and the <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> track was placed in February.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD {{requested}} additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 {{under the}} Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including a freeway along US23 between Standish and Mackinaw City. This extension {{was rejected by}} Congress on December 13, 1968; instead, Michigan was allotted additional mileage for an extension of I-69 to Flint. Once the <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> I-75 was completed along the M-76 corridor in November 1973, the I-75 designation was extended north of Bay City on US23.|$|E

Jetfire places Optimus's body in an escape pod, where Optimus's eyes light up, revealing that he is still clinging to life. Starscream and Megatron take the <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Cybertronian technology.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> silverware until 2014.|$|E
5|$|Rumors that PortAventura {{would be}} {{investing}} in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010. In May 2011, speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose. Land clearing also began {{in the summer of}} 2011. Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24, 2011; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier. The <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> track was installed in mid-April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the track. Testing of the ride began in the same month. Following the completion of testing, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12, 2012 before opening to the public the same day. Over 300 workers from countries such as Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala.|$|E

50|$|The <b>last</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Rathenow are two prose {{collections}} {{which appeared}} in 2004: a book entitled Fortsetzung folgt ("To Be Continued") of 144 pages, and, under the same German title, various texts which are read by the author himself.|$|R
50|$|Arppe had {{far-reaching}} {{plans for}} developing his business, {{but they did}} not materialise before he fell seriously ill. Despite of being partly paralysed, he wanted to be in place seeing when the <b>last</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> machinery of his rolling plant, warped along river Jänisjoki, arrived in Värtsilä. Arppe died in 1861, shortly before era of economical deregulation in Finland.|$|R
5|$|The <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{live music}} {{played in the}} hall, on 14 February 1982, was a {{performance}} by the Glossop School Band, who were {{taking part in the}} North West Amateur Brass Band Championship in front of a crowd of 1,700. The hall had been sold 18 months earlier to a development company, Espley Tyas Development Group, and was by then scheduled for demolition to allow the site to be redeveloped. News of the sale had triggered the formation of local action groups, who organised a petition signed by 50,000 people in an unsuccessful effort to save the hall. The exhibition halls were sold to Mullet Ltd. in 1983, but competition from the newly opened G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to their closure. The site was sold to the British Car Auction Group in 1987, and the buildings demolished {{to make way for a}} large car auction centre.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> his gold.|$|E
5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the <b>last</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, artists drew on Pliny's {{account of}} her sex competition. The Brazilian Henrique Bernardelli (1857-1936) shows her lying across the bed {{at the moment of}} {{exhaustion}} afterwards.
