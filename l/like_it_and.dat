5|$|In June 1944, Kenney was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Seventh Air Forces. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas, each for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>and,</b> over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
5|$|Hordern came to {{prominence}} in the early 1950s when he {{took part in a}} theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. There, he impressed Glen Byam Shaw who secured the actor a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre where he played major parts, including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1958 he won a best actor award at that year's British Academy Television Awards for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).|$|E

5000|$|Stan Lee told Kenneth Plume on a June 26, 2000 interview, [...] "The Hulk {{was done}} intelligently. It {{was done by}} Ken Johnson, who's a {{brilliant}} writer/producer/director, <b>and</b> he made <b>it</b> an intelligent, adult show that kids could enjoy. He took a comic book character and made him somewhat plausible. Women <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> men <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> teenagers <b>liked</b> <b>it...</b> It was beautifully done. He changed it quite a bit from the comic book, but every change he made, made sense." ...|$|R

25|$|Can {{you imagine}} Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Chu Berry, Don Byas, and Ben Webster {{on the same}} little jam session? They had a place called Minton's Playhouse in New York. It's kaput now. And these guys, man, nothing <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> guess who won the fight?...Don Byas walked off with everything.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{tradition}} that Shakespeare, in addition to writing many of the plays his company enacted and concerned with business and financial details as part-owner of the company, continued to act in various parts, such as the ghost of Hamlet's father, Adam in As You <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> <b>and</b> the Chorus in Henry V.|$|E
25|$|The D-12 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} engines of its era, and continued to exchange records with other contemporary high-power engines. No British company could offer anything <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> when Fairey imported 50 of the type (renaming them as the Fairey Felix) the Air Ministry had enough and ordered Napier and Rolls-Royce to start work on cast-block engines of their own.|$|E

25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in As You <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> <b>and</b> the fool in King Lear.|$|E
25|$|Orders {{to compel}} {{arbitration}} in securities-fraud cases {{increased in the}} wake of McMahon, beyond the decision's clarifying effect. In mixed-claim cases <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> Byrd, some lower courts began requiring all claims to be arbitrated in the interest of efficient dispute resolution. Others even began applying it to the 1933 Act, forcing another Supreme Court case in 1989, Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., which finally overturned Wilko.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the trip was not especially successful. Leopold apparently misinterpreted a chance remark of the Emperor as a firm invitation for Wolfgang to compose an opera; this resulted in Wolfgang writing La finta semplice. However, the opera went unperformed in Vienna; the singers and musicians did not <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> intrigues prevented the work from reaching the stage. La finta simplice eventually was premiered in Salzburg, following the Mozarts' return there on 5 January 1769.|$|E
25|$|A single car {{was made}} for William Hurlock in 1930. He <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> agreed to restart very limited production, mainly using {{components}} left over from previous models.|$|R

25|$|Although Armin {{typically}} played these intelligent clown roles, it {{has been}} suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in Othello, on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> Timon of Athens that has no fool or clown for Armin to play.|$|E
25|$|Although Pelléas was Debussy's only {{completed}} opera, {{he began}} several opera projects which remained unfinished, {{perhaps due to}} his fading concentration, increasing procrastination, and failing health. He had finished some partial musical sketches and some unpublished libretti for operas based on Poe's The Devil in the Belfry (Le diable dans le beffroi, 1902–?1912) and The Fall of the House of Usher (La chute de la maison Usher, 1908–1917) as well as considering projects for operas based on Shakespeare's As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> Joseph Bedier's La Legende de Tristan.|$|E
25|$|Neagle and Wilcox {{followed}} with a circus trapeze fable Three Maxims (1937), which was released in the United States as The Show Goes On. The film, with a script featuring a contribution from Herman J. Mankiewicz (later to co-write Citizen Kane with Orson Welles), had Neagle performing her own high-wire acrobatics. Although now highly successful in films, Neagle continued acting on stage. In 1934, while working under director Robert Atkins, she performed as Rosalind in As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> Olivia in Twelfth Night. Both productions earned her critical accolades, {{despite the fact that}} she had never performed Shakespearean roles before.|$|E

25|$|Doctors were {{nevertheless}} influential. They {{liked to}} write. Compared {{to the number}} of books written, not many have survived; for example, Tiberius Claudius Menecrates composed 150 medical works, of which only a few fragments remain. Some that did remain almost in entirety are the works of Galen, Celsus, Hippocrates and the herbal expert, Pedanius Dioscorides who wrote the 5-volume De Materia Medica. The Natural History of Pliny the Elder became a paradigm for all subsequent works <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> gave its name to the topic, although Pliny was not himself an observer of the natural world like Aristotle or Theophrastus, whose Enquiry into Plants included a book on their medicinal uses.|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky later reminisced: [...] "I warned him, if {{you follow}} this, you're {{going to get in}} trouble—because you're going to expose the American {{intellectual}} community as a gang of frauds, and {{they are not going to}} <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> they're going to destroy you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Alternative Press {{magazine}} {{ranked the}} album at No.74 in their [...] "Top 99 Of '85–'95" [...] list, noting that [...] "Love works in extremes and wears that scarlet letter when she feels <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> when she doesn't she rips it off, never neglecting melody and language {{as the real}} medium for her message." [...] In 2009 PopMatters called it an album with [...] "bold musical splendour on display" [...] that [...] " [...] nothing short of gobsmacked".|$|E

500|$|... "I {{loved that}} song. It was {{actually}} Rick Rubin's suggestion. We both loved that song {{and we both}} {{thought it would be}} great for Weezer, and for my voice, and it’d be great to do like a rock version of it with more of an alternative aesthetic. And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
