5|$|This {{rendition}} {{is fraught}} with many errors but the basic story line seems to fit the modern consensus. Father Queroz’s time line is also anachronistic.

5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year or <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{had been}} {{vying for the}} custody of his niece Marie-Thérèse since her release from the Temple Tower in December 1795. He succeeded when Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to {{relinquish}} his custody of her in 1796. She had been staying in Vienna with her Habsburg relatives since January 1796. Louis XVIII moved to Blankenburg in the Duchy of Brunswick after his departure from Verona. He lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment over a shop. Louis XVIII {{was forced to leave}} Blankenburg when King Frederick William II of Prussia died. In light of this, Marie-Thérèse decided to wait a while <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> reuniting with her uncle.|$|E
5|$|The {{initiative}} for a cross-fjord ferry services {{was taken by}} Arthur Selvig, leader of the merchants' association in Levanger. In January 1955, he invited members of the municipal councils {{on both sides of}} the fjord to establish a company. The meeting was held in Levanger, and the representatives from Mosvik took two days to get to the meeting. An interim committee was appointed, which was to cooperate with Innherreds Aktie Dampskibsselskab to persuade them not purchase a new ship, and also to consider purchase of a combined car- and cargo-ferry, or alternatively a conventional vessel. At the time, National Road 755 between Mosvik and Leksvik was being constructed and would be competed by the end of the decade; however, it would take <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> Mosvik would be connected to Venneshamn. The committee suggested the route Venneshamn–Kjerringvik–Vangshylla–Ytterøy–Levanger be established. The municipal council of Ytterøy voted to place the ferry quay at Hokstad, which was serving as the municipal center.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E

25|$|In {{the cooler}} climates of {{northern}} Europe, people could store butter <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> it spoiled. Scandinavia has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating {{at least to}} the 12th century. After the fall of Rome and through much of the Middle Ages, butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by peasants. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early 16th century Roman Catholic Church allowed its consumption during Lent. Bread and butter became common fare among the middle class, and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.|$|E
25|$|In certain cases, {{the excited}} nuclear state {{that follows the}} {{emission}} of a beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10−12 seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed nuclear isomers, and their decays are termed isomeric transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are {{able to stay in}} their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far <b>longer,</b> <b>before</b> emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10−12 seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.|$|E
25|$|In late {{afternoon}} the two lined up as bystanders watched the confrontation. They stood {{with their backs}} to each other at twenty paces. At {{the sound of a}} signal (the gunshot from a pistol) the two quickly turned to each other and fired their weapons. Their initial shots missed but soon after Anderson hit McCluskie in the mouth and neck while the latter hit Anderson in the arm. More shots were fired and McCluskie managed to hit Anderson in the stomach. However, the first one to fall was McCluskie, after Anderson emptied his pistol into him. Unfortunately for Anderson, McCluskie wounds were not fatal, and the two resumed their duel with knives. The second round saw Anderson and McCluskie repeatedly stabbing each other, and ultimately McCluskie fell for a second time, which ended the duel. He was rushed to a boarding house but died a day later. It was said that Anderson lived a short time <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> dying from his wounds as well. The duel was recorded {{in an article in the}} New York World on July 22, 1873.|$|E

25|$|Several factors make large tree holes more {{valuable}} to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more naiads at a time, {{they have a}} higher density of prey {{in the form of}} tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the naiads to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month <b>longer</b> <b>before</b> drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling perhaps a few dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually eat an older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory themselves when they reach reproductive maturity.|$|E
