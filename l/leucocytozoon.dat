5|$|As {{with other}} {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common. 88% of common blackbirds {{were found to}} have intestinal parasites, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (<b>Leucocytozoon,</b> Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).|$|E
5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite <b>Leucocytozoon,</b> and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic mites include Syringophiloidus bombycillae, first {{identified}} on this species, and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus bombycillae. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma species, and a <b>Leucocytozoon</b> first {{identified in this}} waxwing. Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The <b>leucocytozoon</b> blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite <b>Leucocytozoon</b> toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
25|$|Severe biting stress {{when they}} {{seasonally}} swarm near running water. Severe anaphylaxis may develop rapidly in previously sensitized hosts, potentially leading {{to death of}} cattle. Simulium black-flies transmit to <b>Leucocytozoon</b> protozoa poultry birds. They also transmit Onchocerca nematode worms to cattle causing bovine onchocerciasis.|$|E
25|$|Severe biting {{stress to}} cattle, sheep and horses is caused. Horses {{suffer from a}} {{cutaneous}} hypersensitivity reaction called sweet-itch, or Queensland-itch that is caused by antigenic components of saliva of biting midges. Poultry may be severely afflicted with biting stress. Species such as Culicoides imicola and Culicoides variipennis transmit bluetongue virus between sheep and cattle (see diagram and photograph above), and they transmit African horse sickness virus between horses and other equids. Culicoides midges transmit <b>Leucocytozoon</b> protozoa to poultry birds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leucocytozoon</b> caulleryi is {{a species}} of the genus <b>Leucocytozoon,</b> a genus of {{parasitic}} alveolates. It is a rare parasite of the European nightjar.

50|$|The disease {{caused by}} this {{parasite}} {{is similar to}} that caused by <b>Leucocytozoon</b> caulleryi.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} known to spread the {{protozoan}} blood parasite <b>Leucocytozoon</b> tawaki in penguins.|$|E
50|$|The genus {{is divided}} into two subgenera: Akiba and <b>Leucocytozoon</b> - based on the vector species.|$|E
50|$|Hemozoin {{deposits}} (pigment) are not formed - {{a useful}} distinguishing feature for <b>Leucocytozoon</b> from Haemoproteus and Plasmodium.|$|E
50|$|A blood {{parasite}} <b>Leucocytozoon</b> nyctyornis {{has been}} described from this species and feather parasites Brueelia are also known.|$|E
50|$|The {{only known}} {{member of the}} {{subgenus}} Akiba is <b>Leucocytozoon</b> (Akiba) caulleryi which uses members of the genus Culicoides as its vectors.|$|E
50|$|The excess {{mortality}} due to <b>Leucocytozoon</b> {{in adult}} birds seems to {{occur as a}} result of debilitation and increased susceptibility to secondary infection.|$|E
50|$|A second species - <b>Leucocytozoon</b> schufneri - was {{described}} by Prowazek in 1912 also in the chicken. This is now {{considered to be a}} synonym.|$|E
50|$|Blood parasites <b>Leucocytozoon</b> of {{the family}} Plasmodiidae have been noted in the lung tissues. Parasitic {{helminth}} worms Hadjelia truncata and Synhimantus spiralis were recorded as well.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>Leucocytozoon</b> species L. andrewsi {{has both}} {{vertebrate}} and insect hosts. The invertebrate hosts {{belong to the}} flies of the genus Simulium. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are chickens.|$|E
50|$|Over 500 {{species are}} in this order, {{organised}} into four families: the Garniidae, the Haemoproteidae, the Leucocytozoidae, and the Plasmodiidae. The majority of the species lie within three genera: Haemoproteus, <b>Leucocytozoon,</b> and Plasmodium.|$|E

50|$|Cytomeres {{are caused}} by complex invaginations of {{the surface of the}} schizont.

5000|$|<b>Leucocytozoon</b> [...] (or Leukocytozoon) is a genus of {{parasitic}} alveolates {{belonging to}} the phylum Apicomplexa. The parasites were first seen by Vasily Danilewsky in 1884 in blood from an owl. The genus was created by Ziemann in 1898. This taxon was revised by Berestneff in 1904 and then by Sambon in 1908.|$|E
50|$|A {{species of}} blood {{parasite}} from Zoothera marginata, <b>Leucocytozoon</b> mccluri {{is named after}} him.

50|$|A {{species of}} tick in the genus Haemaphysalis {{is known to}} be {{specific}} in its parasitic association with this species and some species of <b>Leucocytozoon</b> are known to be blood parasites. Some species of Haemaphysalis are known to carry the virus responsible for the Kyasanur forest disease. Shikras have been recorded preying on adults.|$|E
50|$|Various Culicoides {{species have}} been shown to be vectors for the {{following}} viruses and conditions: Mansonella spp. (M. ozzardi, M. perstans, M. streptocerca), Onchocerca gibsoni and O. cervicalis, <b>Leucocytozoon,</b> Plasmodium agamae, bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus, African horse sickness, bovine ephemeral fever (C. osystoma and C. nipponesis), Akabane virus, Queensland itch and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. A typical cycle of transmission of a virus by Culicoides is illustrated in the article Parasitic flies of domestic animals.|$|E

50|$|Many Coccidiomorpha have an {{intermediate}} host, {{as well as}} a primary host, and the evolution of hosts proceeded in different ways and at different times in these groups. For some coccidiomorphs, the original host has become the intermediate host, whereas in others it has become the definitive host. In the genera Aggregata, Atoxoplasma, Cystoisospora, Schellackia, and Toxoplasma, the original is now definitive, whereas in Akiba, Babesiosoma, Babesia, Haemogregarina, Haemoproteus, Hepatozoon, Karyolysus, <b>Leucocytozoon,</b> Plasmodium, Sarcocystis, and Theileria, the original hosts are now intermediate.|$|E

50|$|New Zealand, 2010: The {{endangered}} yellow-eyed penguin {{is found}} in southern New Zealand. The population has been reduced by more than 60% since 1990. Researchers collected blood samples from the penguins. They found <b>Leucocytozoon</b> hepatic megaloschizonts in up to 95% of the sampled organisms. This genus of parasite is known to cause many problems in closely related avian species. These problems include tissue damage, reduced fertility, and reduced growth. It was concluded that the yellow-eyed penguins were being infected by biting black flies in their nesting area.|$|E
