50|$|Active belay {{devices have}} a {{built-in}} mechanism that <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the rope {{without the help}} of any other pieces of equipment. The GriGri by Petzl is an example of an active belay device. The offset cam in the GriGri <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the rope automatically to catch a falling climber, much like a seat belt in a car <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> to hold a passenger securely.|$|R

Adamson fights for control but the plane dives into a parked Fast Co oil truck, {{producing}} the second inferno of the night.|$|R

50|$|In one episode, {{when the}} Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the Closet of Silence. In the Closet, {{there are so}} many coats and jackets, they can barely hear each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the <b>lock</b> <b>off,</b> {{injuring}} Larabee in the process.|$|R

5000|$|The {{equivalent}} {{code for}} a game may also turn <b>off</b> <b>clipping,</b> {{but this is not}} the reason why the player can walk through walls. The code turns off collision detection, an entirely separate toggle. The code generally does not turn off back-face culling, which is why the other side of a one-sided wall is not drawn when the player uses [...] "no collision" [...] mode to walk through it.|$|R
50|$|The Vinten Mk 3 Pan & Tilt head used risers and cams to {{maintain}} the centre of gravity. This made the tilting of heavy cameras considerably easier and if correctly mounted a camera could be left at any tilt angle without <b>lock</b> <b>off.</b> The design (by William Vinten's son Bill) was highly innovative for the time.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the homeowner}} leaves, {{the two men}} notice all the food and liquor he has and decide that it will go to waste if it's not consumed.

5000|$|A money line {{began at}} $4,444 and {{eighteen}} random cards were dealt. Each player began with $1,000. The object was {{to select a}} card (numbered 1-18) that raised {{one of the four}} suits (clubs, spades, diamonds, or hearts). Doing so added $100 to their score and gave them the option to pick another card or pass control to the player to their left. Whenever an 8 was selected, the suit would be <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> and could never come down. Selecting a card that did not raise a suit or a card from a <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> suit would incur a strike. Three strikes eliminated a player. The last player left in the game or the player who found the last [...] "8" [...] won the game and the amount in the money line, or their score, whichever was greater. All players kept what they won.|$|R

You can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.' ...|$|R
50|$|Belay {{devices are}} {{mechanical}} friction brake devices {{used to control}} a rope when belaying. Their main purpose is to allow the rope to be <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> with minimal effort to arrest a climber's fall. Multiple kinds of belay devices exist, {{some of which may}} additionally be used as descenders for controlled descent on a rope, as in abseiling or rappelling.|$|R
50|$|In {{the days}} before the explosion, work was ongoing in the {{building}} for the installation of a new 4 in gas line to service the apartments in 121 Second Avenue.

The new line was <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> and not operational.|$|R
50|$|Passive belay devices {{rely on the}} belayer's brake {{hand and}} a {{carabiner}} to <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> the rope. Sticht plates and the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) line of belay devices by Black Diamond Equipment are examples of passive belay devices. If a belay device is lost or damaged, a Munter hitch on a carabiner {{can be used as}} an improvised passive belay device.|$|R

[...] As in the French, the word, retail, in both Dutch and German, also refers to the sale of small quantities of items.|$|R
50|$|Continuing on, {{he stops}} at a closed petrol station {{in the middle of}} the night. The pumps are padlocked, so he takes out his {{revolver}} and shoots the <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> so he can refill his bike with fuel. The next day, Donnelly goes to China Lake for some relaxation and then goes to a nearby diner for lunch and coffee, which he refers to as Black Mud.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards in Poland {{are laid out}} according to the standard US visual and functional layout.

Certain passageways are <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> but {{a good portion of the}} tunnels are accessible from buildings. The purpose of the tunnels is not generally known; the two most common explanations are that they were built to allow people to move between buildings in inclement weather or that they were built as part of an emergency evacuation plan.|$|R

50|$|If the climber climbs {{three feet}} {{higher than the}} last piece of {{protection}} in the rock, and then falls, the rope allows him to fall the three feet to the protection, and another three feet below that. If they fall any further, rope is pulled upwards through the protection from the belayer below. Because the belayer generally keeps the rope <b>locked</b> <b>off,</b> the climber's fall should be arrested and they are left suspended, but safe, somewhere below the protection.|$|R
