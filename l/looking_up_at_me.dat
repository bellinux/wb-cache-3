60|$|He hesitated again, {{gripping}} the window strap, putting his face forward and <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> appealingly.|$|E
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} to the table, and stood facing her across it. She <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with very piteous eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Harold did," [...] said she, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> triumphantly; [...] "he beat all the boys, {{and had to}} {{come back}} again to Boola Boola." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} sewing {{in her lap}} and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> defensively and for {{a moment}} neither of us spoke.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, {{and swore}} {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
60|$|Between me and Gussie, {{who was now}} {{pointing}} in an offensive manner, {{there was nothing but}} a sea of interested faces <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes--And {{what does}} she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's another thing.' She grimaced a little, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mocking laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] {{she whispered}} back, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{eyes that were}} full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|E
60|$|Here the dark-faced Freydisa <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{then dropped}} her eyes again, and stood listening.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke the}} seal, {{went to the}} table, and read. Then she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} a very {{diminutive}} palm and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a beaming smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes.--And {{what does}} she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's another thing." [...] She grimaced a little, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mocking laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, he {{will have}} some beef-tea,” she said, quietly, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> “Until his hearing goes we shall be able to {{communicate}} with him. And after that—” ...|$|E
60|$|He laughed for answer, with {{something}} of exultation in his voice. He swung {{me to his}} shoulder, and held me poised there, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> And then he laughed again.|$|E
60|$|Gilbert <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly, {{as though}} a new thing had come into his mind.|$|R
60|$|In {{surprise}} she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then}} down at the pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I shook my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, Philip Morton," [...] she said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a grave smile. [...] "I am {{very glad}} that you came in here to talk to me. I was so dull." ...|$|E
60|$|The jury {{retired to}} {{consider}} their verdict. I stood in suspense in the dock, with my heart loudly beating. Emily remained {{in the body of}} the court below, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> tearfully and penitently.|$|E
60|$|But, {{he was on}} {{his feet}} directly, and after {{sponging}} himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> out of a black eye.|$|E
60|$|The Duke looked thoughtfully {{for several}} moments at the table before him. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Lord Cheisford {{turned again}} to his notes. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed her. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{wondering}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is his mother," [...] I said hoarsely, {{and then}} she smiled to me, so that I thought her a {{harmless}} mad thing. [...] "He {{was killed by a}} piper called Lauchlan Campbell," [...] she said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> suddenly. [...] "It was my fault." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw {{very much}} what I had {{expected}} to see--de Cartienne's thoroughbred mare splashed all over with mud and still trembling with nervous fatigue, and by her side Dick, the stable-boy, holding a wet sponge {{in his hand and}} <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a scared, disconsolate expression.|$|E
6000|$|... "Egad," [...] said he, {{with good}} nature, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "Mohammed was a philosopher, and so am I, {{and come to}} the mountain. 'Tis worth {{crossing}} an inn in these times to see a young man whose strength has not been wasted upon foppery. May I ask your name, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bes {{squatted down}} upon the floor and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a strange smile on his ugly face.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a little}} smile. I think she must have {{forgotten}} {{the pain in her}} foot.|$|R
60|$|He turned with an oath, and {{followed}} his brother into the wood. Naomi's bright eyes <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> flashing with indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hand me an {{iron and}} line, Bob," [...] said Tom, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I've got a spite agin that feller. He's been up twice already. Ah! hand it down here, {{and two or}} three of ye stand by to hold on by the line. There he comes, the big villain!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] he {{interrupted}} sharply, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I {{know very well}} what I say. I brought it upon myself. It is my own choice. But I couldn't--no, by heaven, I couldn't--accept the alternative. I couldn't keep my faith to her. It was more than man could do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Walter," [...] he replied, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> kindly, and {{speaking}} in English once more, {{as if his}} one anxiety now was {{to get back to}} our former relations towards each other. [...] "Come to my little bit of breakfast before I go my ways among the pupils that I teach." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in her chair, her hands behind her head, a posture she often assumed. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly.|$|R
60|$|He said nothing, but hid {{his face}} in his arms over the rail of the bower. <b>At</b> length he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> fiercely.|$|R
60|$|A faint blush {{came over}} her cheeks, {{and a smile}} broke out on her lips; she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a pretty reproachful air.|$|R
