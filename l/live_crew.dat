5|$|The {{members of}} 2 <b>Live</b> <b>Crew</b> responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

Thompson also said, [...] "the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his AK-47 into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee-wee Herman's views on politics".|$|E

Allmusic writer Steve Huey stated that the song was [...] "a classic hip-hop single", citing Dr. Dre's production as [...] "impeccable as ever, uniting his signature whiny synth melodies with a halting, descending bass line, a booming snare, and soulful female vocals in the background" [...] and alluded to Snoop Dogg, stating [...] "Attitude was something Snoop had by the boatload, his drawling, laid-back delivery projecting unassailable control – it sounded lazy even though it wasn't, and that helped establish Snoop's don't-give-a-damn persona."

500|$|In 1990, the now {{standard}} black-and-white {{warning label}} design reading [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" [...] was introduced and {{was to be}} placed on the bottom right-hand section of a given product. The first album to bear the [...] "black and white" [...] Parental Advisory label was the 1990 release of [...] "Banned in the USA" [...] by the rap group 2 <b>Live</b> <b>Crew.</b> By May 1992, approximately 225 records had been marked with the warning. In response to later hearings in the following years, it was reworded as [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" [...] in 1996. The system went unchanged until 2002, when record labels affiliated with Bertelsmann Music Group began including specific areas of concern including [...] "strong language", [...] "violent content", or [...] "sexual content" [...] on compact discs alongside the generic Parental Advisory label. The Parental Advisory label was first used on music streaming services and online music stores in 2011. That year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) revised its own music censorship policies to incorporate more prominent usage of the warning label.|$|E

While Cristina Jaleru of The Associated Press deduced that the lyrics [...] "First deal changed me, robbed blind, basically raped me / Studied the Carters till a deal was offered, slept cold on the floor recording," [...] are rapped [...] "not as a complaint but as a badge of honor". Nick Aveling of Time Out writes that Azalea is depicted as a [...] "hustler" [...] and a [...] "woman with immense ambition" [...] in the song. In a NPR publication, Ann Powers viewed the lyrics to be of [...] "unremitting toil", as well as detailing a story of Azalea [...] "staying up night after night to master her flow". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight compared the lyrical content to that of Drake's [...] "Started from the Bottom" [...] (2013).

500|$|Although the Able bomb missed its target, Nevada, {{by nearly}} half a mile, and it failed to sink or to {{contaminate}} the battleship, a crew would not have survived. Goat #119, tethered inside a gun turret and shielded by armor plate, received enough fireball radiation to die four days later of radiation sickness having survived two days longer than goat #53, which was on the deck, unshielded. Had Nevada [...] been fully manned, she would likely have become a floating coffin, {{dead in the water}} for lack of a <b>live</b> <b>crew.</b> She was later finished off by an aerial torpedo. In theory, every unprotected location on the ship received 10,000 rems (100 Sv) of initial nuclear radiation from the fireball. Therefore, people deep enough inside the ship to experience a 90% radiation reduction would still have received a lethal dose of 1,000 rems. In the assessment of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, [...] "a large ship, about a mile away from the explosion, would escape sinking, but the crew would be killed by the deadly burst of radiations from the bomb, and only a ghost ship would remain, floating unattended in the vast waters of the ocean." ...|$|E

Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times wrote that with [...] "Showmance", Glee: [...] "admirably {{lived up to}} the promise of its pilot". Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post wrote that [...] "Showmance" [...] "actually trumps the pilot in terms of sheer brilliance, laugh-out-loud moments and heart", while Entertainment Weeklys Tim Stack called the episode [...] "really really fun", observing that: [...] "The quality seen in the pilot definitely does not waver. If anything, the show seems to be finding its footing and tone." [...] David Hinckley of the Daily News rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars and commented: [...] "Glee could have a hard time sustaining what it has set up. But the opening number gives us a rousing good show." [...] The episode's musical numbers attracted positive reviews, particularly Will's rendition of [...] "Gold Digger". Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal praised this performance, also describing the group performance of [...] "Push It" [...] as [...] "glorious in encapsulating every teenage horror". Discussing the performance of [...] "Gold Digger", Dave Itzkoff for The New York Times wrote: [...] "Outside of the catalog of 2 <b>Live</b> <b>Crew,</b> it's hard to imagine a song more inappropriate for a high school glee club [...] but the young misfits of the Fox comedy Glee somehow made it work." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} year and a half, Paterson and Weston {{continued}} to produce [...] "new" [...] material. This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and the Orb soon left the label to sign a deal with Island Records. Their first release on Island Records was the live album Live 93, which gathered highlights from their recent performances in Europe and Asia. It featured the <b>live</b> <b>crew</b> of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and Simon Phillips, as well as audio engineer Andy Hughes, who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring. The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was Pomme Fritz, a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies. Though Pomme Fritz reached [...] #6 on the British charts, critics panned it as [...] "doodling". Island Records [...] "hated it" [...] and [...] "didn't understand it at all", according to Paterson. Soon after production finished on Pomme Fritz, Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with Robert Fripp to form the group FFWD as a side project. FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's Inter-Modo label, which Fehlmann later described as [...] "an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!". Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release. Soon after the release of FFWD in August 1994, Weston suddenly left the Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to his desire to have more control in the Orb. In an interview with i-D, Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson [...] "didn't do his 50 per cent of the work." [...] Paterson reaffirmed the status of the Orb saying, [...] "The Orb is the Orb, and nothing can change that", and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.|$|E

5000|$|He got {{the idea}} of making Portuguese {{versions}} of American songs by paying attention to how people at parties that played freestyle music in Rio de Janeiro, known as [...] "baile funk," [...] would create and sing their own versions of the songs, in Portuguese, as they couldn't understand English, and how they would nickname the songs as [...] "melô do..." [...] ("the ... song"), since the original name of the songs, in English, was too difficult for them to pronounce and memorize. The best example is his first song, [...] "Melô da Mulher Feia" [...] ("song of the ugly woman"), which was how patrons of the [...] "baile funk" [...] would call the 2 <b>Live</b> <b>Crew's</b> version of [...] "Do Wah Diddy," [...] as they would sing along [...] "mulher feia chupa o ... e dá o ..." [...] ("ugly woman sucks ... and gives ...") to the 2 <b>Live</b> <b>Crew's</b> tune. He then made a PG version of the song and recorded it, and was a smash hit on the radio, prompting him to create more songs and record his first album. Later on, Marlboro and others started writing their own songs, and he released several albums.|$|R
