5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money if they can find naughty little boys {{for him to take}} to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends <b>Lampwick,</b> a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that <b>Lampwick</b> has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E
5|$|Chester J. <b>Lampwick</b> created Itchy for the now-lost silent cartoon Manhattan Madness, {{in which}} the mouse brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat cartoon). However, the {{character}} was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, titled That Happy Cat. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together, Steamboat Itchy, a violent parody of Disney's Steamboat Willie. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II-era radio series, at least two films â€” Pinitchio and Scratchtasia (parodies of Pinocchio and Fantasia), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|His {{parents came}} from Latvia to England {{just after the}} World War II. Martin {{attended}} Thornbury Castle School where he excelled in Home Economics. Once he'd finished his education, he learned his craft through college training in Cheltenham and Cambridge. His cooking style is influenced by his half Russian half Latvian mother. He did a spell at the Strand Palace Hotel in London, a season in Switzerland and went on a Greek tycoon's yacht before settling down in a job at <b>Lampwick's</b> in Battersea, London.|$|R
5000|$|From 1950 to {{the early}} 1990s, Maddern {{appeared}} in films and TV series, often portraying military types. He was usually cast as sergeants or corporals, as well as privates, seaman or airmen, played either straight or comically. He played minor roles in five Carry On films. Among his many TV roles were Private Gross in Denis Cannan's Captain Carvallo and old <b>Lampwick's</b> son-in-law in The Dick Emery Show. In 1963, he had a memorable guest role in Perry Mason as jewel smuggler Gilbert Tyrell, in the episode [...] "The Case of the Floating Stones." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{restaurant}} {{opened in}} January 1987. It was {{a joint venture}} between chef Marco Pierre White and restaurateur Nigel Platts-Martin. The two had met while White was head chef at <b>Lampwick's</b> restaurant, and Platts-Martin subsequently purchased Harveys and placed White in charge of the kitchen. Platts-Martin later said that [...] "it was in a terrible state but I bought it out of youthful optimism and invited Marco to become head chef. I knew Marco was an extremely talented chef who cooked sensational food but I was very unsure how things would turn out." [...] A year after opening, the restaurant was closed in order to be renovated. David Collins was the architect, who had previously worked on Pierre Koffman's La Tante Claire.|$|R
500|$|Chester J. <b>Lampwick,</b> {{voiced by}} Kirk Douglas, is {{the creator of}} Itchy and only {{appeared}} in [...] "The Day the Violence Died." [...] The producers' first choice for the character, William Hickey, declined. Douglas's recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the supplied earphones, and said the maximum he would do was two takes.|$|E
500|$|Itchy & Scratchy Studios {{is run by}} Roger Meyers Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon's [...] "creator." [...] The {{studio was}} bankrupted after it was sued by <b>Lampwick</b> for $800 billion, but was saved after {{receiving}} a large cash settlement from the government over its use of Mr. ZIP. The show underwent a brief, non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by Marge Simpson, but returned to its original violent format after Marge was later discredited. Itchy & Scratchy has spawned an Academy Award-winning film adaptation, amusement parks, and a musical, and like Krusty's show, localized versions are produced for other countries, such as Jamaica's The Itchem and Scratchem Blow.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the huge}} success of Snow White, Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio, which {{marked the first time}} an {{animated}} film had used celebrities as voice actors. He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards, also known as [...] "Ukelele Ike", as Jiminy Cricket. Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 12-year-old child actor Dickie Jones, who had previously been in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also cast Frankie Darro as <b>Lampwick,</b> Walter Catlett as Foulfellow the Fox, Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman, and Christian Rub as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub.|$|E
5000|$|Before the donkeys leave Pleasure Island, the Coachman checks them {{by asking}} {{their names to}} make sure they have lost their ability to vocalize, which signifies they are fully transformed. It is clear, however, that the mute donkeys still retain at least some human intelligence, as they appear able to {{understand}} the Coachman's commands. The donkeys that are fully transformed and can no longer vocalize (as in <b>Lampwick's</b> case) are stripped bare of their clothes, hurled into wooden crates, and then sent to work as slaves in salt mines or to perform in circuses. The ones that can still talk (as in the case of one named Alexander) are imprisoned until the transformation finishes; the talking donkeys beg for mercy and to go home but receive none, as the Coachman angrily remarks [...] "You boys have had your fun! Now pay for it!" [...] Unlike in the original text, where the transformation would automatically complete itself once started, the curse in the film occurs gradually. It can also be slowed down or completely stopped by reduced misbehavior, as revealed by the fact that Pinocchio decides not to drink beer or smoke any longer, and is able to escape from the island with only a pair of donkey ears and tail and does not transform any further {{for the rest of the}} film. (This was a shortcut on the film's part, which allowed the producers to skip over some chapters.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lampwick</b> then decides, {{with the}} help of Bart and lawyer Lionel Hutz, to sue Itchy and Scratchy Studios. His case is not solid, until Bart remembers that he saw an {{original}} animation cel created by <b>Lampwick</b> for sale by Comic Book Guy. Buying the cel, Bart shows its inscription, proving that <b>Lampwick</b> is the creator of Itchy. Roger Meyers Jr. then admits that his father stole Itchy from <b>Lampwick,</b> but still rebuffs him by saying that animation is based on plagiarism. The judge rules in favor of <b>Lampwick</b> and orders Meyers to pay <b>Lampwick</b> the $800 million. While Bart is happy that <b>Lampwick</b> is no longer poor, he is sad when he realizes that by helping <b>Lampwick,</b> he has helped take The Itchy & Scratchy Show off television because the studio is bankrupt and forced to close down.|$|E

5000|$|Corey Carrier as <b>Lampwick.</b> Unlike in {{the book}} and the 1940 Disney version, <b>Lampwick</b> truly becomes Pinocchio's best friend, and affectionately calls him [...] "Woody" [...] even after they have both become real boys.|$|E
5000|$|Candlewick then {{appeared}} in Walt Disney's 1940 animated adaptation of Pinocchio. He {{is given the}} alternate translation of his name, <b>Lampwick,</b> and is voiced by Frankie Darro as a human and Clarence Nash in his donkey form. Like his literary version, he is tall and slender, and sports red hair and buckteeth. <b>Lampwick</b> also made a cameo in House of Mouse, and also makes a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit appearing on a poster advertising for [...] "exploding cigars" [...] in Toontown, with his donkey ears from the original film. In the original film, <b>Lampwick</b> befriends Pinocchio during the journey to Pleasure Island and leads Pinocchio astray such as fighting others, smoking, drinking beer and other bad deeds good children wouldn't do. Jiminy Cricket finds Pinocchio playing pool with <b>Lampwick</b> and the latter bullies him calling Jiminy a [...] "grasshopper" [...] and [...] "beetle," [...] laughing at him after Jiminy threatens to fight him. Shortly after this altercation, Jiminy notices that the boys on Pleasure Island are literally turning into jackasses and being rounded up for slave labor. Lampwick's transformation is swift: within a minute, he loses all humanity and is last seen wrecking the pool hall in panic. Strangely enough <b>Lampwick</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent Pinocchio are the last victims to become donkeys; this may simply be a matter of perspective, as <b>Lampwick</b> was one of the worst-behaved boys on the island. In the live action <b>Lampwick</b> has often starred in Disneyland's Electrical Parade along with an unnamed boy from Pleasure Island. <b>Lampwick</b> and the other boys have tails and donkey ears and wave to guests at Disneyland.|$|E
50|$|During {{a parade}} honoring The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Bart meets an elderly {{homeless}} person, Chester J. <b>Lampwick,</b> {{who claims to}} be the creator of Itchy. He insists Roger Meyers, the supposed creator of the characters Itchy and Scratchy, stole the idea from him and proves this claim to Bart with his animated short Manhattan Madness from 1919. The film, however, is suddenly destroyed by the projector. To shelter <b>Lampwick,</b> Bart lets him live at his house. However, the Simpson family wants <b>Lampwick</b> to leave, but Bart does not want him to live on the streets. Suddenly coming up with an idea to properly compensate <b>Lampwick</b> for creating Itchy, Bart and Chester go to Roger Meyers Jr., CEO of Itchy & Scratchy Studios, and ask him for $800 million. They are quickly thrown out.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lampwick</b> {{appears in}} the 1996 film The Adventures of Pinocchio, portrayed by Corey Carrier as a boy whom Pinocchio meets at school and later convinces him to come with him to Terra Magica, where {{they are allowed to}} do {{whatever}} they please. Eventually, they and a few other boys (one of which is Lampwick's best friend Saleo) ride a roller coaster. During the ride, they are splashed with enchanted water which turns them into animals based on their nature. <b>Lampwick,</b> Saleo, and many of the other bad boys turn into donkeys, while Pinocchio only grows donkey ears. They are later corralled by Lorenzini, who fulfills the roles of both the Puppeteer and the Coachman. Pinocchio escapes and sets the other boys free. During their escape, the donkey <b>Lampwick</b> kicks Lorenzini into the sea, turning him into a whale. Close {{to the end of the}} movie, the donkey <b>Lampwick</b> is seen pulling Geppetto, Pinocchio and Leona on a carriage alongside the donkey Saleo. <b>Lampwick,</b> along with Saleo and the other donkeys, returns to human form by doing good deeds. He can be seen playing with the human Pinocchio before the end credits. He calls Pinocchio [...] "Woody" [...] throughout the entire film.|$|E

5000|$|In the episode, Bart meets a {{homeless}} man named Chester J. <b>Lampwick,</b> who claims and successfully proves {{that he is the}} creator of Itchy from The Itchy & Scratchy Show. <b>Lampwick</b> sues Itchy and Scratchy Studios, the owner of the Itchy and Scratchy characters, which he claims stole his idea. After the studio awards <b>Lampwick</b> a US$800 million settlement, it is forced into bankruptcy and shuts down. When The Itchy & Scratchy Show is replaced by a parody of Schoolhouse Rock!s [...] "I'm Just a Bill" [...] segment, Bart and Lisa try to bring the show back. They find a legal precedent that could help their cause, but before they can act, other kids save the day instead.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lampwick</b> {{appears in}} Un burattino di nome Pinocchio a 1972 Italian {{animated}} adaptation of Pinocchio. He is portrayed like the original story: a lazy boy who dislikes school and convinces Pinocchio {{to come to}} the Land of Toys with him. They play many games and eat junk food and go on amusement rides. Eventually he and Pinocchio transform into donkeys and are sold to a farmer and a circus. Near the end of the film, Pinocchio finds <b>Lampwick</b> heavily wounded and exhausted from overwork at the farm and he volunteers to do his work until he feels better, but it is too late and <b>Lampwick</b> dies from his wounds. The character is voiced by Italian actress Flaminia Jandolo in the original version and by Canadian actor Paul Kligman in the 1978 English-dubbed version.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1890, Pinocchio and {{his friend}} <b>Lampwick</b> skip school {{to go to a}} carnival. While there, they watch a {{presentation}} by the carnival's leader, Madame Flambeau. She gives a man with one shorter leg some of her Elixir, and his leg grows to the length of the other one. The carnival's dwarf then leads Pinocchio and <b>Lampwick</b> to [...] "The Hall of Freaks", a place with a clown that washes his face, an albino who can blow fire from his mouth, a large fish tank that have fish with human faces, a woman with a beard, and a fairy called [...] "Blue" [...] who only Pinocchio can see. They then return to Pinocchio's house and find his father Geppetto, who is very sick. Pinocchio and <b>Lampwick</b> then return to the carnival to each buy some of Madame Flambeau's Elixir. Felinet and Volpe, a human-cat and human-fox respectively, lead them to Madame Flambeau. They don't have enough money for the Elixir, so they agree to work for her in the carnival. <b>Lampwick</b> drinks his Elixir and returns home, and Pinocchio gives his Elixir to Geppetto.|$|E

50|$|The next morning, Pinocchio {{finds the}} Elixir has {{transformed}} his father into a puppet. Madame Flambeau enters their house, and gets angry at Pinocchio for giving the Elixir {{to his father}} instead of himself. She reveals she is Lorenzini's widow. Geppetto and Pinocchio are then forced {{to work at the}} carnival's show. Geppetto eventually accepts and enjoys being a puppet, much to Pinocchio's dismay. <b>Lampwick</b> had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir, and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank. Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet, then Geppetto and <b>Lampwick</b> will automatically become human again; but this was a trick so that Pinocchio would perform in front of the prince. Seconds before the show, the dwarf takes Pinocchio; Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets. The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing. Madame Flambeau and her team go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio. The dwarf takes Pinocchio and <b>Lampwick</b> to the forest where Pinocchio came from. The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe.|$|E
5000|$|Madame Flambeau finds Geppetto {{and then}} finds Pinocchio. Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for being more {{interested}} in his fame than his son, and it is implied {{he wants to be}} human again. Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini, a secret he had been hiding the whole time. He plans on cooking <b>Lampwick</b> using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood. Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain. Pinocchio, Geppetto and <b>Lampwick</b> get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway. Once there, they find a pool called the [...] "magic water", something that turns someone/something into their true nature. Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain. <b>Lampwick</b> falls into the water and is instantly restored to human. Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him powerful, but it instead turns him into [...] "the sea monster" [...] over a period of time. Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human. Volpe and Felinet jump in but their true nature remains.|$|E
50|$|Phlomis is a genus of over 100 {{species of}} {{herbaceous}} plants, subshrubs and shrubs {{in the family}} Lamiaceae, native from the Mediterranean region east across central Asia to China. Common names include Jerusalem sage and <b>lampwick</b> plant.|$|E
50|$|In the 2013 American {{animated}} web series RWBY one of {{the main}} antagonists, Roman Torchwick, alludes to Candlewick. The character's appearance is also based on the Disney version of the character, <b>Lampwick,</b> as they both have no respect for the law.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lampwick</b> {{appears in}} the 2008 Pinocchio miniseries, played by Thomas Sangster. The miniseries is more {{faithful}} to the book; <b>Lampwick</b> has a much bigger role than in the Disney film, and he dies toward the end. This also develops him somewhat more, as it implies (though fans of the book or various film versions may have analyzed him this way anyway) that his lawlessness and cynicism comes from having a horrible father, as he tells Pinocchio before he dies {{that if he had}} had a father like Geppetto, he may have turned out more like Pinocchio, and his loyalty to Pinocchio is very apparent too, although most versions do imply their bond is quite strong.|$|E
50|$|This {{version of}} Pleasure Island appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance in Pinocchio's homeworld, Prankster's Paradise. The Coachman, <b>Lampwick,</b> {{and the other}} boys do not appear while Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, and the Blue Fairy do. However, the curse is still included.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lampwick</b> {{appears in}} the 2002 feature film Pinocchio portrayed by Kim Rossi Stuart while his English dub voice was {{provided}} by Topher Grace. In the English version, he is named Leonardo. He first meets Pinocchio in prison after Pinocchio was cheated by the Fox and the Cat, teaching him what lollipop he licks, which is tangerine, and then they meet again after Pinocchio is kidnapped by a farmer in order to replace a dog that died. During that time, <b>Lampwick</b> attempts to steal chickens. Later, he entices Pinocchio to join him at the Land of Toys, where bad boys turn into donkeys. He turns into a donkey and is sold to a farmer.
