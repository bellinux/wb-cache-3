5|$|The {{black stork}} mainly eats fish, {{including}} small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sicklebacks and muddy <b>loaches</b> (Misgurnus and Cobitis). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a higher}} fish {{richness}} {{in the southern part}} of the Western Ghats than in the northern, and the highest is in the Chalakudy River, which alone holds 98 species. Other rivers with high species numbers include the Periyar, Bharatapuzha, Pamba and Chaliyar, as well as upstream tributaries of the Kaveri, Pambar, Bhavani and Krishna rivers. The most species rich families are the Cyprinids (72 species), hillstream <b>loaches</b> (34 species; including stone <b>loaches,</b> now regarded a separate family), Bagrid catfishes (19 species) and Sisorid catfishes (12 species). The region is home to several brilliantly colored ornamental fishes like Denison's (or red line torpedo) barb, several species of Dawkinsia barbs, zebra loach, Horabagrus catfish, dwarf pufferfish and dwarf Malabar pufferfish. The rivers are also home to Osteobrama bakeri, and larger species such as the Malabar snakehead and Malabar mahseer. A few are adapted to an underground life, including some Monopterus swampeels, and the catfish Horaglanis and Kryptoglanis.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. <b>Loaches,</b> trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

50|$|Other {{common names}} for this fish include the Burmese-border sand <b>loach</b> and red-tail sand <b>loach.</b> It is {{sometimes}} mislabeled in pet stores as a zebra <b>loach</b> or Burmese Border <b>loach,</b> which are both {{members of the}} genus Botia.|$|R
50|$|The kuhli <b>loach</b> was {{originally}} described as Cobitis kuhlii by Achille Valenciennes in 1846 to commemorate Heinrich Kuhl's {{work as a}} naturalist and zoologist. The fish is also commonly called coolie <b>loach,</b> giant coolie <b>loach,</b> slimy <b>loach,</b> and leopard <b>loach.</b> In scientific literature, it {{has been referred to}} as Acanthophthalmus kuhlii. The genus name Acanthophthalmus is a junior synonym of Pangio.|$|R
25|$|The {{families}} of Cypriniformes are traditionally {{divided into two}} superfamilies. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the carps and minnows (Cyprinidae) and, according to some, also the mountain carps as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012 Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitioidea and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream <b>loaches</b> (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (Catostomidae), true <b>loaches</b> (Cobitidae), Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking <b>loaches</b> (Gyrinocheilidae), stone <b>loaches</b> (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae and long-finned <b>loaches</b> (Vaillantellidae).|$|E
25|$|Cypriniformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish, {{including}} the carps, minnows, <b>loaches</b> and relatives. This order contains 11-12 families, over 400 genera, and more than 4,250 species, with new species being described every few months or so, and new genera being recognized frequently. They are most diverse in southeastern Asia, and are entirely absent from Australia and South America.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{detection}} {{uses the}} organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in {{shape of the}} gas bladder to the middle ear. It {{can be used to}} regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the weather fish and other <b>loaches</b> are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.|$|E
50|$|The yoyo <b>loach,</b> Almora <b>loach</b> or Pakistani <b>loach</b> (Botia almorhae) is a {{freshwater}} fish {{belonging to the}} <b>loach</b> family Botiidae. It originates in the slow-running and still waters of the Ganges basin in northern India and possibly Nepal. Despite the alternative common name Pakistani <b>loach,</b> the true B. almorhae is not known from Pakistan (the species {{in this country is}} B. birdi).|$|R
50|$|The dwarf <b>loach,</b> ladderback <b>loach,</b> pygmy <b>loach,</b> chain <b>loach</b> or chain botia, (Ambastaia sidthimunki) is a {{freshwater}} fish {{belonging to the}} Botiidae family.

25|$|In the Roman Empire, {{the first}} fish {{to be brought}} indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble. Introduction of glass panes around the year 50 AD allowed Romans to replace one wall of marble tanks, {{improving}} {{their view of the}} fish. In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather <b>loaches</b> and newts.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other species}} that either are {{prominent}} in the aquarium trade or important food fish are native to the Chao Phraya basin, such as the climbing perch, blue panchax, Asian bumblebee catfish, giant snakehead, striped snakehead, walking catfish, banded loach, several Yasuhikotakia <b>loaches,</b> tinfoil barb, Siamese algae eater, silver barb, pearl danio, rainbow shark, Hampala barb, black sharkminnow, Leptobarbus rubripinna, long pectoral-fin minnow, bonylip barb, Jullien's golden carp, blackline rasbora, scissortail rasbora, Tor tambroides, finescale tigerfish, marble goby, Chinese algae eater, giant featherback, clown featherback, giant gourami, several Trichopodus gouramis, iridescent shark, several Pangasius, Belodontichthys truncatus, several Phalacronotus sheatfish, several Wallago catfish, largescale archerfish, smallscale archerfish, and wrestling halfbeak.|$|E

50|$|The pond <b>loach,</b> dojo <b>loach</b> (dojō), or oriental/Japanese weather <b>loach</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), is a {{freshwater}} {{fish in the}} <b>loach</b> family Cobitidae. They are native to East Asia but are also popular as an aquarium fish and introduced elsewhere in Asia and to Europe, North America and Australia. The alternate name weather <b>loach</b> is shared with several other Cobitidae, including {{the other members of}} the genus Misgurnus and the spotted weather <b>loach</b> (Cobitis taenia, commonly known as spined <b>loach).</b> This term comes from their ability to detect changes in barometric pressure and react with frantic swimming or standing on end. This is because before a storm the barometric pressure changes, and this is known to make these fish more active. The pond <b>loach</b> also comes in a variety of colors, such as pink, orange, albino and gray.|$|R

2500|$|Obligate {{cavefish}} {{are known}} {{from a wide}} range of families: Characidae (characids), Balitoridae (hillstream <b>loaches),</b> Cobitidae (true <b>loaches),</b> Cyprinidae (carps and allies), Nemacheilidae (stone <b>loaches),</b> Amblycipitidae (torrent catfishes), Astroblepidae (naked sucker-mouth catfishes), Callichthyidae (armored catfishes), Clariidae (airbreathing catfishes), Heptapteridae (heptapterid catfishes), Ictaluridae (ictalurid catfishes), Kryptoglanidae (kryptoglanid catfish), Loricariidae (loricariid catfishes), Phreatobiidae (phreatobiid catfishes), Trichomycteridae (pencil catfishes), Sternopygidae (glass knifefishes), Amblyopsidae (U.S. cavefishes), Bythitidae (brotulas), Poeciliidae (live-bearers), Synbranchidae (swamp eels), Cottidae (true sculpins), Eleotridae (sleeper gobies) and Gobiidae (gobies). Many of these families are only very distantly related and do not form a monophyletic group, showing that adaptations to a life in caves has happened numerous times among fish. As such, the descriptive term [...] "cavefish" [...] is an example of folk taxonomy rather than scientific taxonomy. Strictly speaking some Cyprinodontidae (pupfish) are also known from sinkhole caves, famously including the Devils Hole pupfish, but these lack the adaptations (e.g., reduced eyes and pigmentation) typically associated with cavefish. Additionally, species from a few families such as Chaudhuriidae (earthworm eels), Glanapteryginae and Sarcoglanidinae live buried in the bottom of aboveground waters, and can show adaptions similar to traditional underground-living (troglobitic) fish. It has been argued that such species should be recognized as a part of the group of troglobitic fish.|$|E
2500|$|Balitoridae and Gyrinocheilidae are {{families}} of mountain stream fishes feeding on algae and small invertebrates. They are {{found only in}} tropical and subtropical Asia. While the former are a speciose group, the latter contain {{only a handful of}} species. The suckers (Catostomidae) are found in temperate North America and eastern Asia. These large fishes are similar to carps in appearance and ecology. Members of Cobitidae common across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. A mid-sized group like the suckers, they are rather similar to catfish in appearance and behaviour, feeding primarily off the substrate and equipped with barbels to help them locate food at night or in murky conditions. Fishes in the families Cobitidae, Balitoridae, Botiidae, and Gyrinocheilidae are called <b>loaches,</b> although it seems that the last do not belong to the lineage of [...] "true" [...] <b>loaches</b> but are related to the suckers.|$|E

2500|$|Catostomoidea {{is usually}} {{treated as a}} junior synonym of Cobitioidea. But it seems {{that it could be}} split off the Catostomidae and Gyrinocheilidae in a {{distinct}} superfamily; the Catostomoidea might be closer relatives of the carps and minnows than of the [...] "true" [...] <b>loaches.</b> While the Cyprinioidea seem more [...] "primitive" [...] than the loach-like forms, they were apparently successful enough never to shift from the original ecological niche of the basal Ostariophysi. Yet, from the ecomorphologically conservative main lineage apparently at least two major radiations branched off. These diversified from the lowlands into torrential river habitats, acquiring similar habitus and adaptations in the process.|$|E
2500|$|In his History of Birmingham, {{published}} in 1782, William Hutton describes {{the presence of}} three mounds adjacent to Chester Road on the extremities of Sutton Coldfield (although now outside the modern boundaries of the town). The site, southwest of Bourne Pool (named [...] "Bowen Pool" [...] by Hutton), is called <b>Loaches</b> Banks and was mapped as early as 1752 by Dr. Wilks of Willenhall. Hutton interpreted the earthworks as a Saxon fortification but further archaeological work led Dr. Mike Hodder, now the Planning Archaeologist for Birmingham City Council, {{to believe that the}} site was an Iron Age hill-slope enclosure. Centuries of agriculture on the land has severely affected the visibility of the features, with the earthworks now only apparent in aerial photography.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the gills}} of most teleost fish {{assist with the}} {{elimination}} of ammonia from the body and although fish virtually by definition live in an environment surrounded by water, most still have a distinct bladder for storing waste fluid. [...] The urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water, though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater ones. [...] Most fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary bladder except in its membranous nature. [...] The <b>loaches,</b> pilchards, and herrings are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed. [...] It is largest in those fish which lack an air bladder, and is situated {{in front of the}} oviducts and behind the rectum.|$|E
