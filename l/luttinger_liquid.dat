40|$|Abstract. When a local {{potential}} changes abruptly in time, {{an electron}} gas responds by shifting {{to a new}} state which at long times is orthogonal {{to the one in}} the absence of the local potential. This is known as Anderson‚Äôs orthogonality catastrophe and it is relevant for the so-called X-ray edge or Fermi edge singularity, and for tunneling into an interacting one dimensional system of fermions. It often happens that the finite frequency response of the photon absorption or the tunneling density of states exhibits a singular behavior as a function of frequency: œâth œâ‚àíœâth) Œ± Œò(œâ ‚àí œâth) where œâth is a threshold frequency and Œ± is an exponent characterizing the singular response. In this paper singular responses of spin-incoherent <b>Luttinger</b> <b>liquids</b> are reviewed.

50|$|A {{very recent}} work {{considers}} {{the role of}} interactions in the stirring of Bose condensed particles. Otherwise {{the rest of the}} literature concerns primarily electronic devices. Typically the pump is modeled as a quantum dot. The effect of electron-electron interactions within the dot region is taken into account in the Coulomb blockade regime or in the Kondo regime. In the former case charge transport is quantized even in the case of small backscattering. Deviation from the exact quantized value is related to dissipation. In the Kondo regime, as the temperature is lowered, the pumping effect is modified. There are also works that consider interactions over the whole system (including the leads) using the <b>Luttinger</b> <b>liquid</b> model.|$|E
50|$|In a non-ideal system, T in the Landauer {{formula is}} {{replaced}} by {{the sum of the}} transmission probabilities for each conduction channel.

This happens when the scattering length in the nanotube is much greater than the distance between the contacts.If a carbon nanotube is a ballistic conductor, but the contacts are nontransparent, the transmission probability, T, is reduced by back-scattering in the contacts. If the contacts are perfect, the reduced T is due to back-scattering along the nanotube only.When the resistance measured at the contacts is high, one can infer the presence of Coulomb blockade and <b>Luttinger</b> <b>liquid</b> behavior for different temperatures.
