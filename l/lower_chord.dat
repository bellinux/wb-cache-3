25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit {{two types}} of steel truss bridge construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, which were the most common early types of steel truss bridges. Due to {{variation}} within each type of bridge, the collection in Fulton County offered {{a unique opportunity to}} view the evolution of late 19th and early 20th century steel truss bridge construction. For example, the now-demolished London Mills Bridge, a Pratt built in 1883, features pinned connection and double eyebars for the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> and for the diagonals. This is compared to the also destroyed Indian Ford Bridge, a Pratt bridge built in 1917, which used riveted connections and I-beam construction for its lower chords and diagonals.|$|E
2500|$|The diagonals and <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> have {{rectangular}} eyebars [...] wide. Round {{bars are}} used for the counters and sway braces. The ties are on iron s riveted to transverse iron floor beams. Both portals are decorated with quatrefoil brackets and finials.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} early {{cantilever}} bridge is the Forth Bridge. This bridge held {{the record for}} longest span {{in the world for}} seventeen years, until it was surpassed by the Quebec Bridge. Benjamin Baker illustrated the structural principles of the suspended span cantilever in the photo on the left. The suspended span, where Kaichi Watanabe sits, is seen in the center. The need to resist compression of the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> is seen in the use of wooden poles while the tension of the upper chord is shown by the outstretched arms. The action of the outer foundations as anchors for the cantilever is visible in the placement of the counterweights.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{both the}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> support roadbeds, forming a double-decked truss. This {{can be used to}} {{separate}} rail from road traffic or to separate the two directions of automobile traffic and so avoiding the likelihood of head-on collisions.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is design and check of steel {{load-bearing}} structure of a footbridge. The footbridge spans the river Svitava in the town Blansko. The span length is 24 metres. The structural design is spatial bar structure with two main trusses. The upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> are curved {{in the shape of}} circular arch and they are connected by diagonal bars. In the level of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> the beams are connected by floor beam. Horizontal rigidity of the upper and lower construction area is secured by bracings. The bridge deck is laid on the lower floor beam. The solution {{is the result of the}} comparison and evaluation of two variants...|$|R
2500|$|Robert E. Drake, who {{had been}} {{employed}} by the Woodworth Company was busy {{with a group of}} men doing cable work at the west anchorage. His death was due the breaking of a cable on a derrick, which sent the boom directly on top of him. The second death, on April 7, 1950, was that of 36-year-old ironworker Lawrence S. Gale. His death was due to a temporary weld failure at a <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> cross strut at panel 33. It was Gale's {{first day on the job}} building the stiffening truss work, and he had noticed a weld that didn't look right. He was going to repair the weld, when it broke. He plunged [...] into the Narrows, along with [...] of steel. A memorial was held on a scow.|$|E
50|$|In December 2006, BridgeClimb {{launched}} {{an alternative to}} climbing the upper arches of the bridge. The Discovery Climb allows climbers to ascend the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> of the bridge and view its internal structure. From {{the apex of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>chord,</b> climbers ascend a staircase to a platform at the summit.|$|E
50|$|Bracing at {{the upper}} chord and at the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> adds strength. To protect against swaying, a round iron rod runs diagonally from one truss to the other.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Taking Jinan Yellow River Bridge as an example, using 3 D {{finite element}} method, {{displacement}} {{and behavior of}} four-line high-speed railway bridge with two main trusses, K-shaped brace and middle suspender is studied. The results show that transversal wave of displacement of floor system is significant, and the difference of the displacement in transversal direction reaches 6 mm. The causes includes: large distance between two main trusses, large stiffness of stringers, longitudinal stiffeners and crossbeams, weak transversal stiffeners which do not connect to <b>lower</b> <b>chords.</b> About 90 % of the loads are transferred to the crossbeam through path 1 and about 60 % to 80 % of these loads through K-shaped braces. Less than 10 % of the loads transferred to <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> through path 2...|$|R
50|$|The end {{posts and}} upper chords are {{built-up}} open box members, consisting riveted plates and angles giving dimensions of 18 x 12 in. The <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> are constructed from 1 x 3 in eye bars. The bridge deck is 14 ft wide and is constructed of wooden planks.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge {{consists}} of six Warren Truss panels on each side. All the interior verticals are paired laced angles, diagonals {{were made from}} pairs of angles. The heaviest {{are located in the}} outer panels. Verticals and diagonal members have riveted stay plates. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> are composed of I beams. Where upper or <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> meet the verticals and diagonals, joins are gussets, which are bolted to all members. The roadbed is created by heavy wooden decking with an overlay of asphalt. The original guardrail remains. On {{the south end of the}} span, fixed onto the face of the right endpost, is a plague which reads [...] "Starke County Commissioners, Peter Mosher, Fred Kingman, Lee Wolfe, Auditor, C.W. Weninger, Engineer, Chas. A. Good. Built By The Rochester Bridge Co. Rochester Ind. 1915".|$|R
50|$|Fink design trusses {{are used}} today for {{pedestrian}} bridges and as roof trusses in building construction in an inverted (upside down) form where the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> is present and a central upward projecting vertical member and attached diagonals provide the bases for roofing.|$|E
50|$|The diagonals and <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> have {{rectangular}} eyebars 4 to 6 in wide. Round {{bars are}} used for the counters and sway braces. The ties are on iron s riveted to transverse iron floor beams. Both portals are decorated with quatrefoil brackets and finials.|$|E
50|$|It is {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} multiple diagonal members projecting down {{from the top of the}} end posts at a variety of angles. These diagonal members extend to the bottom of each of the vertical members of the truss with the longest diagonal extending to the center vertical member. Many Fink trusses do not include a <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> (the lowest horizontal member). This gives the bridge an unfinished saw-toothed appearance when viewed from the side or below, and makes the design very easy to identify. If the bridge deck is carried along the bottom of the truss (called a through truss) or if a lightweight <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> is present, identification is made solely by the multiple diagonal members emanating from the end post tops.|$|E
50|$|Kennedy Bridge joins Bourbong Street and Bourbong Street East over Saltwater Creek. It has {{a single}} metal truss span of 48.8 metres and metal lattice trusses with a curved upper chord. It carries a 7.3 metre roadway and a footpath. The metal deck spans between the <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> of the trusses.|$|R
40|$|The bridge {{exceeded}} the weight limit for the <b>lower</b> <b>chords,</b> which were also faulty in their design, and it collapsed in mid-construction on August 29 th, 1907.; Engineers: Theodore Cooper, Edward Hoare, John Sterling Deans, and Peter Szlapka; For more information see: William D. Middleton, The Bridge at Quebec (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 2001...|$|R
50|$|Burnett Bridge joins Quay Street, Bundaberg with Perry Street, North Bundaberg, {{across the}} Burnett River. It is 412 metres {{in length and}} has eight 51.9 long spans with {{cylindrical}} piers and concrete abutments. The bridge carries a 7.3 metres roadway and a footpath. The road is on transverse metal troughing spanning between the <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> of hog-back lattice trusses.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not very}} likely that Vogel's {{notation}} for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as Gm/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.|$|E
50|$|The bridge's {{design is}} the lattice truss {{patented}} {{earlier in the}} century by Ithiel Town in 1820. Its distinctive feature is the diagonals connected to the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> by pins, which eliminated the need for vertical members on longer bridges. It remained popular through the American Civil War, making the Beaverkill bridge {{one of the last}} of its kind.|$|E
50|$|Two sets {{of heavy}} 3 by 12 in timber planks {{serve as the}} top and bottom chords, with a {{secondary}} <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> at deck level. Twelve-inch (30 cm) diagonals, fastened at each intersection by two-inch (5 cm) treenails, radiate out from the middle to either end. They are supplemented by additional diagonals at the ends and four wooden buttresses along the exterior on either side.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> of the bridge, at 16 by 18 in by 126 ft, {{are among}} the longest timbers ever used in an Oregon bridge. Timbers of this size {{simplified}} some aspects of construction but required special techniques to finish and position at the site. Other features of the bridge include ribbon windows under the eaves, a side window on one side, and semi-elliptical arched portals.|$|R
25|$|The {{depth of}} a truss, or the height between {{the upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>chords,</b> {{is what makes it}} an {{efficient}} structural form. A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and material cost as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is sparely furnished. Gently curved wooden pews with scroll armrests and recessed end panels flank {{the center}} aisle, {{leading to the}} altar. Its wooden flooring is now carpeted; the plaster walls have beaded wainscoting. Above, the wooden trusses with chamfered <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> and collar ties that frame the roof are exposed. At {{the end of the}} aisle is the altar on a raised dais. On it is a wooden lectern with Greek Revival detailing.|$|R
50|$|It {{retained}} the light metal diagonals but substituted heavier metal beams, posts, and chords for the wooden members. The most common Pratt type is the through truss {{in which the}} deck is carried on the <b>lower</b> <b>chord,</b> with overhead lateral supports connecting the top chords. Finally, the Pennsylvania Petit is a Pratt truss with a polygonal top chord and includes reinforcing sub-struts and sub-ties. Theses half-length members reinforced the diagonals and helped resist stresses.|$|E
5000|$|The Lilley Road Bridge {{over the}} Lower River Rouge is an eight-panel Pratt {{camelback}} pony truss with an upper chord constructed from back-to-back channels tied by X-lacing, a <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> constructed from channels with battens, and a floor of built-up I-beams riveted to superstructure. [...] The {{entire length of}} the superstructure is 90 ft, with an 84 ft span. The structure width is 27 ft, with a cantilevered sidewalk {{on each side of the}} roadway.|$|E
5000|$|The Atherton Bridge has iron {{compression}} posts that incline inward {{towards the}} center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> bars, and patented [...] "Phoenix" [...] columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.|$|E
50|$|Roth {{discarded}} Ballard's sketch {{lyrics and}} wrote his own, and denied the suggestion {{to get help}} from songwriter Desmond Child. In June 1996, Roth arrived at 5150 Studios with Eddie without the guitarist warning bandmembers Michael Anthony and Alex Van Halen about the singer's return. Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing on the song features a whammy bar that raises and <b>lowers</b> <b>chords</b> while still keeping them in tune. This effect was achieved by recording with a modified Peavey Wolfgang signature model, featuring a TransTrem tremolo system.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} the two fighters had much in common: both were single bay biplanes with N-form interplane struts, {{dihedral}} only on the upper plane and slight stagger. Though the span of the D.VII was 1.00 m greater, both fighters had upper and lower wings of equal span but narrower <b>lower</b> <b>chords.</b> Over most of the span the wings were straight and parallel edged but the ailerons increased in chord outwards, widening the outer wing. The D.VII differed in having ailerons on both upper and lower planes.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} with a divided-lane through-truss design created {{specifically for the}} difficult river crossing and unique in Victoria. The trusses were originally intended for a deck truss design, but were adapted to allow their use as through trusses with stiffening arches connecting them above the roadway. Two separate roadways with an intervening stone pillar separating them have caused problems for modern traffic. The road deck is made with longitudinal timber planks on large timber cross girders that are supported on the <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> of the trusses.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally, {{the bridge}} is a bowstring tied arch with two {{separate}} yet identical spans supported by end abutments and a center pier of mortared cut limestone blocks. Its <b>lower</b> <b>chord,</b> wrought iron spans between cast iron connecting blocks, is 162 ft long, 13 ft wide and 10.5 ft above water level. Its upper chords are segmental arches of nine tangential iron castings with their bearing surfaces joined at each panel point. They bear the legend [...] "J. D. Hutchinson, Builder, Troy, N.Y., 1870".|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a riveted steel eight-panel single span {{camelback}} pony truss bridge on a rural section of M-86. The bridge is 90 feet long, with a 32.8-foot-wide concrete deck and a 27 feet wide roadway. Five I-beams support the floor. The upper chord is constructed with back-to-back channels with lattice, while the <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> and verticals are constructed from {{two pairs of}} angles with a plate in the middle. A metal guard rail serves as a railing. The bridge is supported with concrete abutments, and U-shaped concrete wing walls line the approach on each side.|$|E
50|$|The Pegram truss is {{a hybrid}} between the Warren and Parker trusses where the upper chords {{are all of}} equal length and the lower chords are longer than the {{corresponding}} upper chord. Because {{of the difference in}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chord</b> length, each panel is not square. The members which would be vertical in a Parker truss vary from near vertical {{in the center of the}} span to diagonal near each end (like a Warren truss). George H. Pegram, while the chief engineer of Edge Moor Iron Company in Wilmington, Delaware, patented this truss design in 1885.|$|E
5000|$|Town and Howe truss {{designs were}} {{patented}} by Ithiel Town in 1820 and William Howe (architect) in 1840, respectively. [...] The Rexleigh Bridge employs [...] "the patented Howe truss, with paired diagonal timbers, single timber counters, and multiple vertical iron rods defining each truss panel. The diagonals and verticals {{are connected to}} the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> by means of cast-iron bearing blocks." [...] Those bearing blocks are [...] "embossed with the name of their manufacturer, 'R. Comins, Troy, N.Y.,'" [...] and, although the timber used is local, the bridge [...] "appears to be a rare surviving example of this type of prefabricated nineteenth-century bridge construction." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} tolled, costing 6 cents for {{a horse and}} carriage, and 3 cents for foot passengers. These were abolished in 1867. Between 1902 and 1903, the bridge was raised up {{as part of a}} development project on the nearby dam. In 1949, the Connecticut State Highway Department [...] "replaced much of the <b>lower</b> <b>chords</b> and all of the treenails". In 1969, the last major alteration was the installation of large plate girders to support the weight of traffic, which were concealed from view with the addition of exterior sheathing. The cost of the project was originally estimated at $50,000 in 1967, , and noted that any changes in the appearance of the bridge would have to be approved by the Kent's Board of selectmen.|$|R
40|$|Concern of {{my thesis}} is {{to design the}} main load {{carrying}} structure of an exhibiton pavilion. The pavilion itself has circle shaped footprint, 55 m in diameter. Height of the building is then 15 m. The main structure consists of planar truss elements with generally curved upper and <b>lower</b> <b>chords.</b> The web of main truss element is designed as a perforated steel wall. Structural analysis and dimension design of main truss element is realised via axis model with rigid nodes, and verified on an accurate numerical model of a truss with web modelled as a perforated steel wall. Building {{is designed to be}} situated at exhibition area of Olomouc city. Design involves all the critical cross sections, and also selected mounting joints...|$|R
