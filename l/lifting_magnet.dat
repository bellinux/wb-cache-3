40|$|An iron ball floats {{in midair}} {{in a plastic}} box when several iron balls were {{attracted}} by a permanent magnet. A complex interaction between magnetized sphere materials and a <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet</b> enabled the suspension of an iron ball. The balls {{in the first row}} are simply attracted by the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet.</b> The ball in the second row is also attracted by the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet,</b> however, due to the repulsive forces exerted from the balls sitting above, it can float in midair. We also found that there are two stable positions for the ball to float. The floating ball could be transported from one equilibrium position to another by simply rotating the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet.</b> This will make it possible to construct a noncontact load transport device.

25|$|Another {{downside}} is that the EDS system naturally creates a field in the track in front and {{to the rear of}} the <b>lift</b> <b>magnets,</b> which acts against the magnets and creates magnetic drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds (This is one of the reasons why JR abandoned a purely repulsive system and adopted the sidewall levitation system.) At higher speeds other modes of drag dominate.|$|R
5000|$|A {{safe working}} load (SWL) should, {{according}} to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on {{the configuration of the}} equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye bolts, <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> and <b>lifting</b> beams should also be marked. [...] The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely. Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.|$|R
5000|$|In many {{practical}} applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets,</b> and loudspeakers, the iron core {{is in the}} form of a loop or magnetic circuit, possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps. [...] This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less [...] "resistance" [...] (reluctance) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At present, {{the lifting}} {{electromagnet}} {{is widely used}} in almost all {{the countries in the}} world. But it has some fatal disadvantages related to the electrical power input that it requires among other things. To eliminate these disadvantages, a Rare Earth <b>lifting</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> was designed. This paper introduces the magnetic circuit design of <b>lifting</b> permanent <b>magnet.</b> At the same time, a perfect self-acting driving system has been invented, which guarantees that the attracted cargoes can be lifted or unloaded fast and conveniently without using any electricity at all...|$|R
50|$|It can be {{seen that}} to {{maximize}} the force, a core with a short flux path L and a wide cross sectional area A is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap). To achieve this, in applications like <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> (see photo above) and loudspeakers a flat cylindrical design is often used. The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms {{the other part of the}} magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.|$|R
5000|$|Magnet {{fishing is}} a searching in outdoor waters for metal {{magnetic}} objects available to pull {{with a strong}} magnet. With the availability of cheap strong neodymium magnets, this activity is becoming popular and also useful in recent years. The hope is that something valuable will surface, but often miscellaneous items like bottle caps and keys are found as well. In fact, strong <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> called magnet retrieval tools are specially designed to retrieve items that are lost {{at the bottom of}} bodies of water. [...] Different types of magnets that are popular are mounting magnets and MMS-G magnets when going magnet fishing.|$|R
40|$|The module has a movable {{vibrator}} head (2) with {{at least}} two plates (6, 8). One plate (8) carries a holder (10) for parts or tools. The two plates are parallel to a base of the vibrator head remote from the workpiece and are driven in oscillation along a longitudinal direction so that the tool holder vibrates in a plane. Each plate has a through opening (18, 20) for a rotary drive connection from the holder to a drive unit (24) {{on the other side of}} the plate from the workpiece. The plate on the workpiece side rotatably encloses the holder. The plates can be positioned wrt. each other and the head base for fine positioning. The positioning and oscillating drives for the plates are each provided by <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> (28, 30) interacting with a sprung return device (36, 38). ADVANTAGE - Compact module can be manufactured efficiently...|$|R
50|$|Repulsive {{systems have}} a major {{downside}} as well. At slow speeds, the current induced in these coils by the slow change in magnetic flux with respect to time, is not large enough to produce a repulsive electromagnetic force sufficient to support {{the weight of the}} train. For this reason the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches a speed that can sustain levitation. Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track must be able to support both low-speed and high-speed operation. Another downside is that the repulsive system naturally creates a field in the track in front and {{to the rear of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>magnets,</b> which act against the magnets and create a form of drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds, at higher speeds the effect does not have time to build to its full potential and other forms of drag dominate.|$|R
50|$|Before the electropermanent magnet was invented, {{applications}} {{needing a}} controllable magnetic field required electromagnets, which consume {{large amounts of}} power when operating. Electropermanent magnets require no power source to maintain the magnetic field. Electropermanent magnets made with powerful rare-earth magnets are used as industrial <b>lifting</b> (tractive) <b>magnets</b> to <b>lift</b> heavy ferrous metal objects; when the object reaches its destination the magnet can be switched off, releasing the object. Programmable magnets are also being researched {{as a means of}} creating self-building structures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} parameters like size of actuator and rail, current density, no of turns of coil, permeability of magnetic material, winding dimension etc. has been studied. An FEM analysis of U-I structure of rail (guide-way) and actuator for electromagnetic levitation system has been performed by the utilizing of the ANSYS software. The design of electromagnets is primarily controlled by the input power to lift power ratio and <b>lift</b> power <b>magnet</b> weight ratio. These factors are dependent on the magnet dimensions, required gap flux and hence the required current density in the winding. The magnet configurations chosen {{on the basis of}} required pole-face area and necessary window area to house the excitation coils. In this work a FEM based analysis has done to find out the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity, force etc. for single actuator based levitation system. The changing of different parameters of rail and actuator the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity and force will change.
