3000|$|The {{results show}} that the odds of closure in general is much higher (15.054 times higher) with {{observed}} triads than with rewired ones. In the real jazz world musicians are playing repeatedly with each other, while in the rewired world nothing ensures coherence – there are no band identities, and band leaders repeatedly playing with the same musicians.

40|$|Abstract: The {{authors have}} been {{studying}} the fundamental mechanics of legged vehicles {{with the aim of}} establishing generic principles for their mechanical design. The approach to date has been to consider overall machine design and leg mechanism design separately. In leg design there is inevitably a trade-off between workspace (reach) and <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> for given loading conditions. To understand this trade-off, the effects of leg geometry on both kinematic workspace and <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> must be investigated. <b>Leg</b> <b>weight</b> is largely a function of the hip and knee design torques; the former is determined by the overall machine design which has been discussed elsewhere. This paper considers the effect of leg geometry on the total design torque that the knee must support through both its structure and the knee actuator. The actuator design torque is also con-sidered. The leg geometry varied includes link lengths and knee twist angles. The necessary mathemat-ical analyses are developed and data presented showing the relationship between knee or actuator torque and leg geometry...|$|E

To evaluate the dose-response relation between this pharmacological interference and dependent edema, a frequent {{side effect of}} CCBs during antihypertensive treatment, skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at the dorsum of the foot, both supine and with the limb passively placed 50 cm below the heart level, and <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> (Archimedes principle) were measured at baseline, during increasing doses of the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 and 10 mg UID each for 2 weeks), and after drug withdrawal in 10 hypertensive men. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those parameters were evaluated according to a similar design during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) combined (n= 10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n= 8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> without modifying postural vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from horizontal to dependent position), which indicates that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg UID, however, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and increased <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> further, which suggests that skin blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> but reduced the amount of dependent fluid extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses...|$|E

Four birds were sacrificed for each treatment, at 28 and 84 d, totaling 64 animals. Electrophoresis technique identified the presence of three myosin heavy chain types: MyHC-I, MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IIb, in the flexor hallucis longus muscle of the broilers. There was increase in MyHC-II and decrease in MyHC-I, as age passed. Only at 84 days-old was the MyHC-II expression influenced by strain, confirming a response of selection in Ross lineage on a more glycolytic muscle.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} effect of amlodipine, a {{prototype}} dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker with lercanidipine, a newer dihydropyridine compound with lipophilic properties, on dependent oedema generation and interference with skin blood flow vasomotion in hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Single-blind, sequence-randomized, cross-over comparison of amlodipine and lercanidipine. Drugs were given at equipotent doses (10 mg daily and 20 mg daily, respectively) in 22 never-treated mild-to-moderate hypertensive men (age: 48 +/- 5 years). Each treatment was administered for 2 weeks with a 2 -week intervening period to restore baseline values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependent oedema formation was quantified through <b>leg</b> <b>weight</b> changes (water displacement method). Blood pressure (the mean of at least 10 determinations) was recorded by an automated oscillometric device and skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) measured at the dorsum of the foot, both supine and with the limb passively placed 50 cm below the heart level, to evaluate the behaviour of cutaneous postural vasoconstriction, an autoregulatory mechanism that minimizes gravitational increases in capillary pressure and avoids fluid extravasation when standing. RESULTS: <b>Leg</b> <b>weight</b> was increased by both drugs, but the increase was significantly greater during treatment with amlodipine than with lercanidipine. Blood pressure decreased to a similar extent and postural vasoconstriction was antagonized comparably during both treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The oedema-forming potential of amlodipine is greater than that induced by lercanidipine, a difference which emerged {{in the presence of}} a comparable drop in blood pressure and could not be attributed to interference with postural vasoconstrictor mechanism...|$|E

The likelihood ratio {{test was used to}} determine the most adequate model for each trait. For carcass, breast, and <b>leg</b> <b>weight,</b> and for carcass and breast yield, maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects as well as the covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects were significant. The estimates of direct and maternal heritability were 0. 17 and 0. 04 for carcass weight, 0. 26 and 0. 06 for breast weight, 0. 22 and 0. 02 for <b>leg</b> <b>weight,</b> 0. 32 and 0. 02 for carcass yield, and 0. 52 and 0. 04 for breast yield, respectively. For leg yield, maternal permanent environmental effect was important, in addition to direct genetic effects. For that trait, direct heritability and maternal permanent environmental variance as a proportion of the phenotypic variance were 0. 43 and 0. 02, respectively. The results indicate that ignoring maternal effects in the models, even though they were of small magnitude (0. 02 to 0. 06), tended to overestimate direct genetic variance and heritability for all traits.

40|$|The {{growing public}} health burden {{associated}} with insufficient physical activity {{has resulted in}} the development of numerous health initiatives and products aimed at stabilizing and reversing the negative trends reported in epidemiological literature. A relatively novel product that has only recently made its way to the market are wearable weights called Body Togs®. These products are designed to be worn on the lower legs and arms along with regular clothing as a means to increase caloric expenditure. However, no research to date has tested the efficacy of this product. PURPOSE: Compare the physiological responses within bouts of aerobic exercise that vary on intensity and the presence of wearable weights. METHODS: Seventeen (11 female, 6 male, mean age = 24 years ± 5. 92) healthy volunteers were tested for aerobic fitness on a treadmill to determine VO 2 max (mean = 42. 68 ml x kg- 1 x min- 1). Participants then completed eight 30 -minute walking trials on a treadmill while oxygen consumption (VO 2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored while walking at different speeds and with varying combination of upper and lower body wearable weights. The design included two intensities (slow walking and brisk walking) and four conditions (no <b>weights,</b> arm <b>weights,</b> <b>leg</b> <b>weights,</b> and arm and <b>leg</b> <b>weights)</b> for a total of eight experimental trials. RESULTS: Data were analyzed using ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons. Analyses revealed that VO 2 was significantly lower without the wearable weights in comparison to wearing both upper and lower weights in the slow walk trial (P 3 ̆c 0. 001; ES = 0. 69) and also during the brisk walk trial (P 3 ̆c 0. 001; ES = 0. 62). HR was significantly higher during the brisk walk trials with togs on both the arms and legs (P= 0. 029, ES= 0. 31). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that exercising while using wearable weights increases energy expenditure and has minimal impact on HR.

Additionally, wearing the togs during exercise increases energy cost of walking, therefore allowing for possible weight loss applications...|$|R
