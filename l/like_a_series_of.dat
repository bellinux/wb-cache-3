5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{approaches}} {{have recently been}} proposed for understanding art appreciation, emphasizing the role of perceived artist's intentions and messages in how lay people define what is "art" and what is "good" art. In particular, {{it is argued that}} a work of art automatically triggers speculation about the artist's intention, and that it is intuitively assessed as an act of symbolic communication. The current experimental study tested these claims by presenting participants with various artifacts and works of art, alongside differing levels of information regarding the artist's intentions, and asking them to rate the artifacts on artistic merit. In total, 505 adults participated in four experiments. In experiment 1, participants used the artists' putative intentions to decide whether certain artifacts were instances of "art. " In experiments 2 a and 2 b, titles that ostensibly clarified the artists' messages were found to increase participants' understanding and, importantly, <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> works of art. In experiment 3, high levels of perceived investment from artists were found to increase how much participants <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> paintings. Overall, the results suggest that perceived artists' intentions and messages affect what people consider to be art and good art. The art experience is not only about beauty or hedonistic pleasure, but involves assessment of the artist's intention and of the history behind the work of art...|$|R

500|$|According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's autobiographies {{have been}} {{characterized}} as autobiographical fiction, but Lupton disagrees, stating that they {{conform to the}} genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. [...] Angelou's use of themes, especially that of racism, connects all seven autobiographies. [...] One of her goals, beginning with Caged Bird, was to incorporate [...] "organic unity" [...] into them, and the events she described were episodic, crafted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> short stories, and were placed to emphasize the themes of her books.|$|E

The results demonstrated that oral movements varied significantly with the type of semi-solid food and with the type of attribute. Individual subjects displayed a highly idiosyncratic behaviour. Oral movements were significantly related to sensory ratings of liking, creaminess and roughness. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Ian Martin, who had written their extended biography at Allmusic, had highlighted the song as an album standout and career standout.

Despite this, she praised the scenes featuring Creed Bratton and James Spader, believing Bratton's performance consisted of [...] "the funniest scenes of the episode", and that Spader [...] "was given the meatiest part, gamely channeling his dominating boss role from Secretary". White ultimately gave the episode a 6.5/10, calling it [...] "Okay". TV Squad writer Joel Keller criticized the episode for not featuring a true plot, writing that [...] "this felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> sketches in search of a plot." [...] The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais also commented on the outlandishness, particularly Warren Buffett's appearance, saying [...] "If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one."

Spill.com critics Corey Koleman and Co-Host 3000 gave the film a [...] "Some ol' bullshit", the site's second lowest rating. They criticized the film's overuse of slow motion, lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action, but gave the film points for its cinematography, small bits of action, 3D and the special effects of the Axeman. Andrew Barker of Variety compared the film to the previous installment as [...] "equally moribund, and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative". He compared Roberts' Wesker to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith from The Matrix, calling it a [...] "slipshod impression". A particularly scathing review came from Brian Orndorf of Dark Horizons, who commented: [...] "Perhaps the first 3D motion picture to simulate the experience of watching paint dry, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life." ...|$|E

500|$|McWhorter {{recognizes that}} much of the reason for Angelou's style was the [...] "apologetic" [...] nature of her writing. [...] When Angelou wrote Caged Bird {{at the end of the}} 1960s, one of the {{necessary}} and accepted features of literature at the time was [...] "organic unity", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion. [...] The events in her books were episodic and crafted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. [...] Instead, they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that [...] "Angelou's poetry and prose are similar". [...] They both rely on her [...] "direct voice", which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird). [...] According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. [...] For example, she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry. [...] In addition, she used the elements of blues music, including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. [...] Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 5/10, noting [...] "Overall, this episode {{attempted}} to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing the agents to interact with an 'alien' culture. Unfortunately, {{the structure of the}} episode gave the audience answers long before the agents discovered them, making the bulk of the episode an exercise. By not taking the theme far enough or deepening the mystery, the writers ultimately fail to reach their goals." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the entry a C+ and wrote that the episode [...] "was also fairly bold for its time, providing a whole subplot that's mostly told through subtitles [...] it feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup." [...] Ultimately, VanDerWerff concluded that, [...] "the major problem with 'Hell Money' is that it feels, at times, like a backdoor pilot for a new series starring B.D. Wong as corrupt detective Glen Chao." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She critiqued the fact that the episode lacked a paranormal mystery, noting that the theme of the episode [...] "would fit nicely into any other police drama". Vitaris described the [...] "three actors in the black suits and ghost masks" [...] as [...] "not very convincing." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Daily News writer David Hinckley said Lowe and Scott {{were strong}} {{additions}} to the show, and that Scott's character in Parks was better than his character in Party Down.

New York magazine writer Steve Kandell described Lowe as entertaining but [...] "one-note", but said Adam Scott was [...] "much more promising and nuanced", with better potential for a romantic interest for Leslie than previous guest stars like Will Arnett and Justin Theroux. Kandell felt Schneider's imminent departure from the series seemed unceremonious, and praised Nick Offerman's reactions of [...] "unbridled ecstasy" [...] at the idea of cutbacks and the government shutdown. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic expressed doubt about the long-term effectiveness of Lowe's character, and said the April and Andy subplot felt [...] "dragged out for yet another week". However, he praised the script, the addition of Scott, and the performance of the entire cast, especially Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari. Hochberger said, [...] "I'm not convinced Parks and Recreation could have a bad episode {{at this point in the}} season." [...] TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher felt [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was an especially important episode due to the addition of the Lowe and Scott characters, the beginning of Mark's exit from the series and the economic problems for Pawnee. However, Gallagher also said the episode felt mostly like a preparation for the third season.|$|E
