25|$|In the 1930s {{and working}} independently, American {{electronic}} engineer Claude Shannon and Soviet logician Victor Shestakov both showed a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} concepts of Boolean logic and certain electrical circuits, now called <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> which are now ubiquitous in digital computers.

40|$|The {{resonant}} tunneling device (RTD) {{has attracted}} much attention because of its unique negative differential resistance characteristic and its functional versatility and is more suitable for implementing the threshold <b>logic</b> <b>gate.</b> The universal <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> has become an important unit circuit of digital circuit design because of its powerful logic function, while the threshold <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> is a suitable unit to design the universal <b>logic</b> <b>gate,</b> but the function synthesis algorithm for the n-variable logical function implemented by the RTD-based universal <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> (UTLG) is relatively deficient. In this paper, three-variable threshold functions are divided into four categories; based on the Reed-Muller expansion, two categories of these are analyzed, and a new decomposition algorithm of the three-variable nonthreshold functions is proposed. The proposed algorithm is simple and the decomposition results {{can be obtained by}} looking up the decomposition table. Then, based on the Reed-Muller algebraic system, the arbitrary n-variable function can be decomposed into three-variable functions, and a function synthesis algorithm for the n-variable logical function implemented by UTLG and XOR 2 is proposed, which is a simple programmable implementation...|$|R

25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} logic device, a programmable logic controller, <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> and flip flops or relays. More specifically, a hardware implementation requires a register to store state variables, {{a block of}} combinational logic that determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational logic that determines the output of an FSM. One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E
25|$|RTL {{is only a}} {{behavioral}} model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, {{the next step in}} the IC design process, physical design stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> and transistors that will go on the chip.|$|E
25|$|While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each {{containing}} a single three-input NOR gate, the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used 2,800 ICs, each with dual three-input NOR gates. The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor-transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via wire wrap, and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic. The {{use of a}} single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II guidance computer, which used a mix of diode-transistor logic and diode <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|E

25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} used to simplify {{real-world}} logic requirements {{so that they can}} be implemented using a minimum number of physical <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> A sum-of-products expression can always be implemented using AND gates feeding into an OR gate, and a product-of-sums expression leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate. Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in conditional statements, can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. Content-addressable memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for on-chip cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
