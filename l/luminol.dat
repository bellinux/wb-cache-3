5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray <b>luminol</b> by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

25|$|Another protein, aequorin, {{found in}} certain jellyfish, {{produces}} blue {{light in the}} presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions have in common is their use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with <b>luminol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. <b>Luminol</b> tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|E

50|$|Crime scene {{investigators}} use <b>luminol</b> to find {{traces of}} blood, even {{if someone has}} cleaned or removed it. The investigator sprays a solution of <b>luminol</b> and the oxidant. The iron in blood catalyses the luminescence.

The blue glow lasts for about 30 seconds per application. Detecting the glow requires a fairly dark room. Any glow detected may be documented by a long-exposure photograph.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Luminol</b> may be {{synthesized}} by reverse-phosphorescence, two-step process. It begins from 3-nitrophthalic acid. [...] First, hydrazine (N2H4) {{is heated}} with the 3-nitrophthalic acid in a high-boiling solvent such as triethylene glycol and glycerol. An acyl substitution condensation reaction occurs, with loss of water, forming 3-nitrophthalhydrazide. Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group with sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), via a transient hydroxylamine intermediate, produces <b>luminol.</b> But 3-nitrophthalhydrazide itself has the glow.|$|E

50|$|When <b>luminol</b> is sprayed evenly {{across an}} area, trace amounts of an {{activating}} oxidant make the <b>luminol</b> emit a blue glow {{that can be}} seen in a darkened room. The glow only lasts about 30 seconds, but investigators can document the effect with a long-exposure photograph. Crime scene investigators must apply it evenly to avoid misleading results, as blood traces appear more concentrated in areas that receive more spray. The intensity of the glow does not indicate the amount of blood or other activator present, but only shows the distribution of trace amounts in the area.|$|E
50|$|Forensic {{investigators}} use <b>luminol</b> {{to detect}} trace amounts of blood at crime scenes, as it reacts with the iron in haemoglobin. Biologists {{use it in}} cellular assays to detect copper, iron, and cyanides, as well as specific proteins by western blot.|$|E
