30|$|Based on {{previous}} {{developments of the}} STA, namely the incorporation of a variable angle for {{the direction of the}} principal compressive stresses for concrete, Hsu and Mo (1985 a, b) proposed the Variable Angle Truss Model (VATM). This model aimed to unify the torsional design of beams with small and large cross sections, as well as RC beams and beams with longitudinal and uniform prestress, that is, prestressed concrete (PC) beams. In the VATM, the conventional stress (σ)–strain (ε) relationship for uniaxial compressive concrete was substituted by a smeared softened σ–ε relationship to account for the softening effect (influence of the diagonal cracks due to the perpendicular tensile stresses). VATM proved to give good results for the ultimate torsional behavior of RC and PC beams (Hsu and Mo 1985 a, b). This is because VATM neglects the concrete tensile strength and also the influence of the concrete core for plain beams, so this model approaches the real model only for high <b>loading</b> <b>stages</b> (Hsu and Mo 1985 a, b; Bernardo et al. 2012 a).
