5|$|Most of {{the people}} who <b>live</b> <b>around</b> Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their {{distinctive}} roofs (which curve upwards at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can <b>live</b> <b>around</b> six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
50|$|There are subgroups or subtribes of Taita. They can {{be divided}} into Wadawida who {{traditionally}} <b>lived</b> <b>around</b> the Dawida, the Wasagalla who <b>lived</b> <b>around</b> the Saghalla and the Wakasighau who <b>lived</b> <b>around</b> the Kasighau massif of the Taita Hills. The Saghalla people speak Kisaghala which is much closer to Kigiriama or Mijikenda (nine tribes who speak almost same language). The Kasighau are more closer to the Pare and Chagga of Tanzania but are a Taita-speaking people.|$|R
50|$|Many catalufas {{commonly}} live in {{the waters}} around islands. This species <b>lives</b> <b>around</b> reefs at depths up to 400 m, though it is usually found between 165 and 200 m. It <b>lives</b> <b>around</b> rocks and ledges with invertebrate life such as sponges and corals.|$|R

5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which <b>live</b> <b>around</b> Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|In Libya {{and other}} {{countries}} of the region, mass celebrations erupted, with the Lufthansa hijackers and the liberated Munich perpetrators being treated as heroes. Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast <b>live</b> <b>around</b> the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel {{to put them on}} trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, Israel would subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed.|$|E

5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and <b>live</b> <b>around</b> the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males <b>live</b> <b>around</b> 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E

His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a relatable everyman, and protect him from the outside world with a sense of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|Vikos–Aoös National Park {{preserves}} one of {{the richest}} mountain and forest ecosystems in terms of wildlife diversity in Greece. Numerous species of large mammals such as wolves, foxes, wild horses, and roe deer are found in the area year-round. Otters and wild cats <b>live</b> <b>around</b> the area of Tymfi, with the latter being quite rare. The Pindus range, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is home to the endangered brown bear and lynx, and is also the southernmost point of their European habitat. One of the park's special attractions is the existence of the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), a rare species that lives at higher altitudes far from human activity, especially at the rocky cliffs of the gorges, for example in Megas Lakos, a secondary ravine of the Vikos Gorge.|$|E

5|$|The Javan rhino can <b>live</b> <b>around</b> 30–45years in the wild. It {{historically}} inhabited lowland rain forest, wet grasslands, {{and large}} floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans, but will attack when it feels threatened. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly {{due to their}} extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on February 28, 2011, by WWF and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults. As of 2016 there are only 63 individuals {{left out in the}} wild and none captive.|$|E

They may <b>live</b> <b>around</b> features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish. Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are good to eat, these fish have been commercially harvested.|$|E
