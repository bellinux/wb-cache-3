25|$|Two muscles on {{the lateral}} {{side of the}} leg form the peroneal group. The peroneus longus and brevis both have their origins on the fibula and they both pass behind the <b>lateral</b> <b>malleolus</b> where their tendons pass under the peroneal retinacula. Under the foot, the longus {{stretches}} from the lateral to the medial side in a groove, thus bracing the transverse arch of the foot. The brevis is attached on the lateral side to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal. Together the two peroneals form the strongest pronators of the foot. The peroneus muscles are highly variable and several variants can occasionally be present.|$|E

40|$|Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is {{a chronic}} granulomatous {{infectious}} disease that primarily affects the peripheral nerves, skin, {{upper respiratory tract}} mucosa, eyes and certain other tissues. It is diagnosable and curable if recognized early and treated adequately. A twenty nine-year-old male from Jessore, Bangladesh reported in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh with the complaints of multiple erythematous, large, raised and circumscribed lesions with loss of sensations on {{different parts of the}} body, especially distal portions of all four limbs for last eight months. Subsequently he developed ulcers on the anesthetic fingers due to smoking and few ulcerative lesions on both feet. Skin examination revealed multiple erythematous, large nodular lesions {{on both sides of the}} cheek and forehead, multiple erythematous, indurated, large plaques with raised margin and central clearing on the trunk, waist and all four limbs, few satellite lesions around the large plaques on the trunk, few hypopigmented patches and plaques on buttock and lower limbs, multiple painless ulcers on dorsal surface of fingers of both hands, both <b>lateral</b> <b>malleoluses</b> and right sole. On examination of peripheral nerves, left great auricular nerve, both ulnar nerves and both common peroneal nerves were moderately enlarged and tender. Slit skin smear for AFB (modified Z-N stain) was done and revealed that there were large number of acid and alcohol-fast bacilli arranged in straight and curved parallel bundles with globular masses (cigar-bundle appearance), morphologically resembling Mycobacterium leprae. Skin biopsy for histopathological examination revealed extensive infiltration of macrophages in the dermis, separated from epidermis by narrow grenz zone, with destruction of skin adnexa. Few foci of poorly defined granuloma in dermis were also noted. The patient was managed with rifampicin, clofazimine, dapsone, prednisolone and omeprazole...|$|R

METHODS: Evaluative and personalized methods were used for the capture and analysis of angle images obtained from 19 NB, 26 FMB and 17 OMB children of either gender aged 8 to 10 years on anterior, posterior and profile views. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to analyze the three groups as a whole and the Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups (p = 0. 05). RESULTS: The angle related to the lateral knee condyle, <b>lateral</b> ankle <b>malleolus</b> and 5 th metatarsal diaphysis (KAM) was significantly greater in NB than in FMB children. With respect to the angle related to the nasal external acoustic meatus and pogonion (GMM), nasal external acoustic meatus and manubrium (GME), and 2 nd cervical vertebra, major cervical curvature point and 7 th cervical vertebra (C 2 C 7), significantly higher values were observed for the OMB group compared to NB children. The angle formed by the 2 nd thoracic vertebra, the major prominent thoracic point and the 9 th thoracic vertebra (T 2 T 9) was significantly greater in FMB than in OMB children.

40|$|Following {{an acute}} ankle {{inversion}} trauma, {{the aim of}} the diagnostic strategy is to rule out a fracture and/or lateral ankle ligament rupture. Plain X-rays are indicated when weightbearing is impossible (the patient cannot take at least four steps) and/or if there is pain on palpation on the posterior aspect of the <b>lateral</b> or medial <b>malleolus.</b> This applies to the period directly following the trauma as well as 4 - 5 days later. In the first forty-eight hours after trauma, physical examination cannot distinguish between a distortion and a lateral ligament rupture. In a patient with a painful swollen ankle after an acute inversion trauma, a compression bandage is applied and the patient is advised to elevate the leg and to perform ankle movements, notably dorsal extension. Weightbearing on the extremity may be allowed as soon as the pain allows. A few days later, when pain and swelling have subsided, delayed physical examination for detection of a lateral ligament rupture is performed. Delayed physical examination four to five days after inversion trauma has good interobserver agreement. Additional diagnostics such as radiography, arthrography, ultrasound investigation and MRI are expensive and give no further information. In a patient with a simple distortion an elastic bandage for a few days can be applied. The patient is instructed to resume normal walking as soon as possible. Functional treatment with inelastic tape bandage or a brace application for five to six weeks is the treatment of choice for an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture. The aim of treatment is restoration of a normal range of motion within two weeks and a stable ankle at long term follow-u...|$|R

OBJETIVOS: Mensurar e comparar a postura de crianças respiradoras bucais obstrutivas (RBO) e funcionais (RBF), entre si e com crianças respiradoras nasais (RN), através da biofotogrametria computadorizada e verificar a viabilidade e a eficácia da utilização deste método. MÉTODOS: Utilizaram-se métodos avaliativos e personalizados de captação e análise das imagens angulares de 19 crianças RN, 26 RBF e 17 RBO, de 8 a 10 anos de idade, de ambos os sexos, em face anterior, perfil e posterior. RESULTADOS: Para análise dos resultados, aplicou-se o teste não-paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis e de Mann-Whitney (p= 0, 05). Observou-se que a angulação obtida relativa ao côndilo lateral do joelho, maléolo lateral do tornozelo e diáfise do 5 ° metatarso (JTM), os resultados dos RN foram significativamente maiores do que os RBF. Quanto às angulações relativas à glabela, meato acústico esterno e mento (GMM), glabela, meato acústico esterno e manúbrio do esterno (GME) e 2 ª vértebra cervical, local de maior curvatura cervical e 7 ª cervical (C 2 C 7), os resultados dos RBO foram significativamente maiores do que os RN. Na angulação relativa à 2 ª vértebra torácica, local de maior proeminência torácica e 9 ª torácica (T 2 T 9), os resultados dos RN foram significativamente maiores do que os RBO. Na angulação de C 2 C 7, os resultados dos RBO foram significantemente maiores do que os RBF, e na medida relativa a T 2 T 9, os resultados dos RBF foram significativamente maiores do que os RBO. CONCLUSÃO: A técnica da biofotogrametria computadorizada revelou-se ser segura e fidedigna, permitindo a mensuração e comparação dos valores obtidos entre as crianças analisadas, assim como a verificação da detecção de alterações posturais nos respiradores bucais...|$|R
