It was included on Bedingfield's second North American album, Pocketful of Sunshine, and features vocals from reggae singer Sean Kingston. The song was written by Bedingfield, Kingston, Louis Biancaniello, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Sam Watters, and Wayne Wilkins, while production was handled by Biancaniello, Love, Tedder, and Watters under their production group, The Runawayz. Its lyrics discuss finding love with {{a person who has}} [...] "been there all your life and has always <b>loved</b> <b>you,</b> but you've never noticed it until now". The official remix features vocals from rapper Lil Wayne and a slightly different beat, produced by Jim Jonsin.|$|E
500|$|Stephen {{begins to}} dress in {{masculine}} clothes made by a tailor rather than a dressmaker. At twenty-one she {{falls in love with}} Angela Crossby, the American wife of a new neighbour. Angela uses Stephen as an [...] "anodyne against boredom", allowing her [...] "a few rather schoolgirlish kisses". Then Stephen discovers that Angela is {{having an affair with a}} man. Fearing exposure, Angela shows a letter from Stephen to her husband, who sends a copy to Stephen's mother. Lady Anna denounces Stephen for [...] "presum to use the word love in connection with...these unnatural cravings of your unbalanced mind and undisciplined body." [...] Stephen replies, [...] "As my father <b>loved</b> <b>you,</b> I loved...It was good, good, good– I'd have laid down my life a thousand times over for Angela Crossby." [...] After the argument, Stephen goes to her father's study and for the first time opens his locked bookcase. She finds a book by Krafft-Ebing– assumed by critics to be Psychopathia Sexualis, a text about homosexuality and paraphilias– and, reading it, learns that she is an invert.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Ketèlbey {{composed}} songs, providing {{the words for}} most of those written after 1913. His first, unpublished, song, [...] "Be Still, Sad Heart" [...] dates from 1892, and {{during the rest of}} the 1890s he wrote songs for children as well as sentimental ballads like [...] "Believe Me True" [...] (1897) for their seniors. Many had words by Florence Hoare, whose other lyrics included English words for songs by Tchaikovsky, Gounod and Brahms. Ketèlbey's popular ballads included [...] "The Heart's Awakening" [...] (1907), [...] "My Heart-a-dream" [...] (1909), [...] "I <b>Loved</b> <b>You</b> More Than I Knew" [...] (1912), [...] "My Heart Still Clings to You" [...] (1913), [...] "Will You Forgive?" [...] (1924), and [...] "A Birthday Song" [...] (1933). He wrote patriotic songs for use in three wars: [...] "There's Something in the English After all" [...] (1899, during the Boer War), [...] "The Trumpet Voice of Motherland is Calling" [...] (1914, for the First World War) and [...] "Fighting for Freedom" [...] (1941, during the Second World War). His sole Shakespeare setting, [...] "Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind" [...] (1898, revised 1951), was written as incidental music for a production of As You Like It.|$|E
500|$|Outside Julie's cottage, Carrie {{describes}} her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch.

[...] Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind [...] to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. [...] Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. [...] He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: [...] each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. [...] Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. [...] He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. [...] He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly. [...] Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy's presence ("If I <b>Loved</b> <b>You</b> (Reprise)").|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E
