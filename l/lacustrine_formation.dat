This newly defined group crops out extensively in an elongated belt from the Gulf of Zula to the North to the Garsat area to the south. In the Buia-Dandiero area it ranges in age from the Early to the Middle Pleistocene, and incorporates six formations, from bottom up: the fluvial Bukra Sand and Gravel, the deltaic and <b>lacustrine</b> Alat <b>Formation,</b> fluvial Wara Sand and Gravel, the <b>lacustrine</b> Goreya <b>Formation,</b> the fluvio-deltaic Aro Sand and alluvial Addai Fanglomerate. This succession is bounded by two major unconformities, which separate it from the Neoproterozoic basement and from the overlaying Boulder Beds fanglomerate, and has been designated the Maebele Synthem. The latter is the result of two lacustrine transgression and regressions evidenced by two depositional sequences. The unconformities bounding the Maebele Synthem are related to the tectonic history of the basin fill and its substrate. The development of the two sequences was, instead, mainly controlled by lake level fluctuations and, hence, by climatic variations connected with the weakening and strengthening of the monsoons in the northwestern Indian ocean. The environment where the Buia Homo lived was a savannah with some scattered water pools.

To the west, diverse formations present paranaense's foraminifera together with groups of brackish or fresh-water macro and microfauna. In this region, the Santa María Group (Sierras Pampeanas, Tucumán and Catamarca provinces), includes two <b>formations</b> with thick <b>lacustrine</b> sequences, the San José Formation (middle Miocene) and the Chiquimil Formation (upper Miocene). Since the foraminifera discovery in this group in the 1980 s, the sedimentary rocks that hold them were in general assigned to the San José Formation, but without a precise stratigraphic control. The goals of the present work are the systematic identification of the foraminifera fauna, the stratigraphic identification into formational units of the layers that contain them and the exposure of hypotheses explaining the presence of foraminifera in lacustrine facies. Methodologically we made facial and systematic field sampling in outcrops of layers assigned as fertile in foraminifera, and we have also used samples supplied by YPF, extracted during the 1980 s. From a total of 35 samples, 14 were positive containing foraminifera. Four samples correspond to the Chiquimil Formation with the following species: Ammonia parkinsoniana (d'Orbigny) and Lippsina demens (Bik) forma santamariana Zabert. It is noteworthy, in this formation, the joint presence of characids with Ammonia parkinsoniana (d'Orbigny) in the same stratigraphic level. Ten samples of the San José Formation gave the following species: Ammonia parkinsoniana (d'Orbigny) and Nonion sp. We conclude that both <b>lacustrine</b> <b>formations</b> of the Santa María Group hold a foraminiferal microfauna.

Large variations in dD values (up to 40 ‰ for nC 17 and up to 30 ‰ for nC 29 alkanes as well as up to 10 ‰ for kerogen) in closely spaced samples are evident throughout the core and remain preserved even {{at the bottom of}} the section. dD values of individual n-alkanes show a slight overall D-enrichment with depth, and a general trend of increasing dD values with increasing n-alkane chain length characterizes all samples, particularly in those below 600 m depth. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of kerogen samples overlap with those of n-alkanes throughout the section. dD values of pristane and phytane are more negative than those of nC 17 alkane by as much as 120 ‰ at shallow depths but increase dramatically and approach dD values of nC 17 alkane in the samples closest to the oil window. Integration of analytical and computational results indicates that: (1) n-alkanes and isoprenoids have the potential to preserve the original biological signal before the onset of oil generation; (2) isomeric and structural rearrangements taking place at the beginning stages of oil generation do not influence significantly the dD values of n-alkanes and kerogen.

Six facies associations, each described in terms of depositional processes and geometries, have been identified and interpreted to represent a range of proximal to distal deltaic sub-environments: delta plain, distributary channel, mouth-bar, delta front, prodelta and open lake. The facies associations and their architectural elements reveal characteristics which are not common in traditionally described shoal-water deltas. Of note, different facies arrangements are observed in the distributary channels in different sectors of the delta, passing from thick single-storey channel fills embedded within delta-plain fines in landward positions, to thin, amalgamated and multi-storey channels closer to the river mouth. This study proposes a new depositional model for shoal-water deltas in high-accommodation settings documenting, for the first time, that shoal-water delta deposits can form a substantial part of stratigraphic successions that accumulate in these settings. The proposed depositional model provides new criteria for the recognition and interpretation of these deposits; {{the results of this study}} have applied significance for reservoir characterization...|$|R
40|$|Virtually {{the entire}} Late Triassic and {{earliest}} Jurassic age {{section of the}} early Mesozoic Newark continental rift basin has been recovered in over 6770 m of continuous core {{as part of the}} Newark Basin Coring Project (NBCP). Core was collected using an offset drilling method at seven sites in {{the central part of the}} basin. The cores span most of the fluvial Stockton Formation, all of the lacustrine Lockatong and Passaic formations, the Orange Mountain Basalt, and nearly all of the <b>lacustrine</b> Feltville <b>Formation.</b> The cores allow for the first time the full Triassic-age part of the Newark basin stratigraphic sequence to be described in detail. This includes the gray, purple, and red, mostly fluvial Stockton Formation as well as the 53 members that make up the lacustrine Lockatong (mostly gray and black) and Passaic (mostly red) formations. The nearly 25 % overlap zones between each of the stratigraphically adjacent cores are used to test lateral correlations in detail, scale the cores to one another, and combine them in a 4660 -m-thick composite section. This composite shows that the entire post-Stockton sedimentary section consists of a hierarchy of sedimentary cycles, thought to be of Milankovitch climate cycle origin. Lithostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic correlations between core overlap zones and outcrops demonstrate that the individual sedimentary cycles can be traced essentially basinwide. The agreement between the cyclostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy shows both the cycles and the polarity boundaries to be isochronous horizons. Detailed analysis of the Newark basin shows that high-resolution cyclostratigraphy is possible in lacustrine, primarily red-bed rift sequences and provides a fine-scale framework for global correlations and an understanding of continental tropical climate change...|$|R

One species, Mataichthys bictenatus Schwarzhans, Scofield, Tennyson, and T. Worthy gen. et sp. nov., an eleotrid, is established on a skeleton with otoliths in situ. The soft embedding rock and delicate, three−dimensionally preserved fish bones were studied by CT−scanning tech− nology rather than physical preparation, except where needed to extract the otolith. Fourteen species of fishes are de− scribed, 12 new to science and two in open nomenclature, representing the families Galaxiidae (Galaxias angustiventris, G. bobmcdowalli, G. brevicauda, G. papilionis, G. parvirostris, G. tabidus), Retropinnidae (Prototroctes modestus, P. vertex), and Eleotridae (Mataichthys bictenatus, M. procerus, M. rhinoceros, M. taurinus). These findings prove that most of the current endemic New Zealand/southern Australia freshwater fish fauna was firmly established in New Zea− land as early as 19 – 16 Ma ago. Most fish species indicate the presence of large fishes, in some cases larger than Recent species of related taxa, for instance in the eleotrid genus Mataichthys when compared to the extant Gobiomorphus. The finding of a few otoliths from marine fishes corroborates the age determination of the Bannockburn Formation as the Altonian stage of the New Zealand marine Tertiary stratigraphy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} illite, smectite, loughlinite (Na 20. 3 MgO. 6 SIO 2. 8 H 20) and chlorite {{are present in}} the < 2 /zm fraction of the <b>lacustrine</b> Green River <b>Formation</b> (Eocene) of Wyoming. Material amorphous to X-rays and random mixed-layer structures are present in subordinate amounts. Individual crystals vary from pure, well-ordered structures topoorly crystallized forms. Illite is ubiquitous, occurring in all the samples studied. It is generally associated with other clay minerals but frequently occurs as the only clay mineral found in the 'oil shales'. Smectite ispresent in all three members of the Green River Formation, but its presence frequently shows an inverse relationship to both analcime and loughlinite. Loughlinite is restricted to the saline facies of the Wilkins Peak Member. Chlorite occurs only in the silty and sandy beds of the Tipton Shale Member. The distribution ofrandom mixed-layer structures and amorphous material is irregular. Several independent lines of evidence favour an in situ origin for many of the clay minerals reported in this investigation. The 'oil shales', which are in most cases varved, kerogenous, dolomitic marls, have a variable clay mineral composition. There is a marked tendency, however, for illite to be the dominant or the only clay mineral present. Apparently the geochemical conditions favouring the accumulation of the oil shales also favoured in situ generation of illite...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the interactions between climate change, landscape erosion and sedimentation, a detailed study was conducted on Plio-Pleistocene non-marine deposits of the Palm Spring Group in the Fish Creek-Vallecito basin, California, USA. Three inter-related studies focused on (1) local response to global climate change in late Pliocene-early Pleistocene time, (2) large-scale evolution of lithofacies architecture, and (3) climate modulation of late Pliocene sediment flux on Milankovitch time scales. 	Stable isotopes and paleosol classification reveal that between ~ 4. 0 and 0. 75 Ma, aridity increased in the study area concurrent with a shift towards a less intense and more winter-dominated precipitation regime. These changes are interpreted to reflect the long-term waning of summer monsoon precipitation in southern California. 	A dramatic and enigmatic reorganization of basin strata occurred at 2. 9 Ma. Detailed basin analysis shows that locally-derived sediment was supplied by the predecessors of two modern drainages, Vallecito and Carrizo creeks. Initial progradation of alluvial deposits from these two sources across the Colorado River delta plain began between 4. 0 - 3. 4 Ma. At 2. 9 Ma, rapid progradation of these two deposystems was coeval with emplacement of a megabreccia and transgression of Borrego Lake. My data indicate that tectonic realignments at both local and regional scales drove this reorganization. 	Time series analysis of rock magnetic data from a densely-sampled stratigraphic section of the <b>lacustrine</b> Tapiado <b>Formation</b> reveals that between 2. 9 and ~ 2. 75 Ma landscape denudation in the Carrizo Creek catchment was partly modulated by orbital obliquity. Peaks in landscape denudation implied by my data correspond to obliquity highs. More frequent high intensity precipitation events (i. e. monsoons and tropical storms) probably drove increased erosion during these time periods relative to obliquity lows. The breakdown of this relationship at around 2. 75 Ma corresponds to a dramatic increase in northern hemisphere glaciation and may reveal a reduction in monsoonal influence in southern California.

40|$|The Lower Jurassic (Sinemurian to Pliensbachian) Precipice Sandstone is {{the oldest}} {{formation}} and a regional aquifer in the Surat Basin, straddling southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales. Time-equivalent units are recorded in the Eromanga (Poolowanna Formation) and Clarence-Moreton (Ripley Road /Helidon Formation) basins. The Precipice Sandstone is generally considered to consist of braided channel deposits, which upwards become increasingly sinuous or meandering and ultimately {{give way to a}} <b>lacustrine</b> succession—the Evergreen <b>Formation.</b> Marine influence has been proposed by some, for parts of the Evergreen Formation. The transition from the Precipice Sandstone to the conformably overlying Evergreen Formation is gradual and diachronous leading to stratigraphic nomenclature inconsistency around the boundary. During sedimentological description of the Precipice Sandstone core from one of QGC Pty 2 ̆ 7 s ground water wells (Woleebee Creek GW 4) ‘tidal’ features (flaser and wavy bedding, synaeresis cracks, clay drapes and Lockeia traces) were recorded. Biostratigraphy samples contained ‘brackish’ or coastal margin flora supporting the tidal interpretation. Although not sampled for biostratigraphy, similar ‘tidal’ facies have been noted where the Precipice Sandstone crops out in the Carnarvon Gorge section of Carnarvon National Park (Queensland), ∼ 200  km from the Woleebee Creek GW 4 well, suggesting widespread development of a tidal system or systems. The Precipice Sandstone can be divided into an upper and lower unit; each has a distinct sedimentological and electric or wireline-log character, which are described and have been mapped in over 750 wells across the Surat Basin...|$|R
