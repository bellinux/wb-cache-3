This study was motivated by the need to assess risks associated with incorporating acoustic testing capability in wind tunnels with semicryogenic high Reynolds number aerodynamic and/or low pressure capabilities. The study consisted of three phases: 1) measurement of acoustic properties of selected <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> at subatmospheric pressure conditions, 2) periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure of <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> for 250 cycles, and 3) determination of the effect of periodic cold soak on the acoustic properties of the <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> at subatmospheric conditions and the effect on mechanical resiliency. The selected <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> were Pyrell foam, Fiberglass, and Kevlar. A vacuum facility was used to create the subatmospheric environment in which an impedance tube was placed to measure acoustic properties of the test materials. An automated cryogenic cooling system was used to simulate periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure. It was found that lower ambient pressure reduced the absorption effectiveness of the <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> to varying degrees. Also no significant change in the acoustic properties occurred after the periodic cold soak. Furthermore, mechanical resiliency tests indicated no noticeable change...|$|R

40|$|The bottom liners in the {{municipal}} landfill sites {{are expected to}} prevent the migration of pollutants (leachate) to the groundwater. Different types of <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> are {{being used in the}} construction of liners of municipal landfills over the world. Compared to the <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> such as Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCL) and High Density Polyethythene (HDPE), Compacted Clay Liners (CCL) are more economical, if materials are locally available. Different types of clay have been experimented for their suitability as <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> in many countries. An expansive soil however, having a high plasticity index can be expected to absorb more volume of water emanating from the leachate and as a result it can withstand longer dry periods before cracks develop. Further, even if cracks do develop during a prolonged dry period, the cracks may self heal with the subsequent exposure to a rainy period as the shrink-swell behavior of expansive soils is reversible. Therefore, in this study, the suitability of a locally available expansive soils in which the major clay mineral is montmorillonite was investigated for use in landfill liners. For this purpose expansive soils obtained from Digana and Moragahakanda areas of Sri Lanka were chosen as candidate soils. The Rowe Cell apparatus was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the consolidated soil sample using de-aired water as the permeant liquid. The results showed that for all the test specimens hydraulic conductivity was less than 1 x 10 - 9 m/s conforming to the requirements of maximum hydraulic conductivity recommended for <b>liner</b> <b>materials.</b> Similar tests were performed on expansive soils obtained from Moragahakanda amended by the addition of 5 % bentonite (Sodium Bentonite). Addition of bentonite resulted in a decrease of hydraulic conductivity by a significant amount. Therefore, it can be concluded that subjected to the satisfaction of durability criteria the expansive soils of Digana and Moragahakanda are suitable as <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> and have the potential to be incorporated into a relatively thin liner by amending with bentonite...|$|R

Commercially available refractories were exposed to coal gasifier reactor environments, reproduced in the laboratory with a high-temperature, high-pressure test facility, followed by extensive postexposure evaluation. Thirty-six castable or gunnable refractories and cements and 24 refractory brick were evaluated. The behavior of castable refractories reinforced with stainless steel fibers was also examined. Gas environments that were evaluated included steam, H 2, CO 2, CO, and typical high-and low-Btu gas mixtures. Exposure pressures ranged from 100 to 1, 000 psig, temperatures from 5000 to 1, 1000 C, for periods from 50 h to 2, 000 h. In some exposures, sodium and/or potassium hydroxide were introduced in order to simulate a high-alkali environment. It was found that intermediate-and low-alumina refractories produced from domestically available raw materials, rather than high-alumina refractories produced from imported raw materials, gave the best service as <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> and that alkali attack was probably not a serious problem with most refractories.

50|$|The {{penetration}} depth {{is proportional to}} the maximum length of the jet, which {{is a product of the}} jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the <b>liner</b> <b>material,</b> the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material. The speed can reach 10 km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2-5 km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are face-centered cubic metals, as they are the most ductile, but even graphite and zero-ductility ceramic cones show significant penetration.|$|E

The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size.

CIPP requires bypass of the flow in the existing pipeline while the liner is being installed. The curing may take from one hour to 30 hours depending on pipe diameter and curing system (steam / water / uv) and must be carefully monitored, inspected, and tested. Obstructions in the existing pipeline, such as protruding laterals, must be removed prior to installation. Cost should be compared with similar methods such as Shotcrete, thermoformed pipe, close-fit pipe, spiral wound pipe and sliplining as these other methods can provide a similar design solution for similar or less cost in certain situations.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate alternative landfill <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> that could be utilized in conjunction with current liners in order to improve the liner's performance by preventing the release of hazardous chemicals into the subsurface environment. Five alternative <b>liner</b> <b>materials</b> were tested in this study: granular activated carbon, lignite, compost, peat moss, and powdered activated carbon produced from cotton gin trash. Three volatile organic compounds are used in this study: Benzene, Toluene, and O-Xylene. The linear Langmuir isotherm coefficients, Qo, and b, and the linear adsorption distribution coefficient K,,.,, were determined by equilibrium studies for each chemical and material. The retardation factor, R., was calculated from the breakthrough curve data for each combination of chemical and material. The cotton gin trash dissolved in the presence of each of the solvents so no data is presented for this material. Because activated carbon sorbed all of the chemical during the isotherm testing, no data could be collected for the extraction procedure. Lignite has the highest adsorption capacity of the three remaining materials and the second highest retardation factor. Activated carbon has the highest retardation factor of each of the chemicals, as expected. The results show that the adsorption capacity and the retardation factor are more dependent on surface area and pore diameter than on the organic carbon content of the test materials.
