5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
2500|$|A single [...] {{fragment}} {{from a large}} <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> (UCMP 143274), {{found in}} deposits from the Lance Creek Formation in Niobrara County, Wyoming, had been {{thought to be the}} oldest parrot fossil and is presumed to have originated from the Late Cretaceous period, which makes it about 70million years old. However, other studies suggest that this fossil is not from a bird, but from a caenagnathid oviraptorosaur (a non-avian dinosaur with a birdlike beak), as several details of the fossil used to support its identity as a parrot are not actually exclusive to parrots, and it is dissimilar to the earliest-known unequivocal parrot fossils. Likewise, the earliest parrots did not have the specialised crushing bills of modern species.|$|E

50|$|The beak of the owl is short, curved, and downward-facing, and {{typically}} hooked {{at the tip}} for gripping and tearing its prey. Once prey is captured, the scissor motion of the top and <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> is used to tear the tissue and kill. The sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> to deliver this motion. The downward-facing beak allows the owl’s field of vision to be clear, as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the face.|$|E

50|$|It {{feeds on}} insects which are found hidden within the {{branches}} of the trees. It also feeds on the nectar of flowers shaped like its bill. It also looks for invertebrates at the floor of the forest where there is a large amount of natural growth. This bird uses its long bill to peck open the bark to reach the larvae; it then uses its thin upper bill to probe out the meal and its <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> to crush its meal.|$|E
50|$|Common greenshanks are {{brown in}} {{breeding}} plumage, and grey-brown in winter. When in water, they can appear {{very similar to}} marsh sandpipers but are distinguished by {{the shape of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> which gives it an upturned appearance to the bill. They have long greenish legs and a long bill with a grey base. They show a white wedge on the back in flight. They are somewhat larger than the related common redshank. The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as teu-teu-teu.|$|E
50|$|All akepa have {{an unusual}} cross-bill. When closed, the upper bill tip {{slightly}} overlaps the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> tip {{to one side}} (this cannot {{be seen in the}} field). When opening the bill, as in prying open leaf buds to extract small caterpillars, the bills swing dramatically sideways, and this is easily seen in the hand. Some birds cross one way, and some the other, apparently randomly. The akepa cross-bill operates similarly to that in the North American crossbills (genus Loxia), but is much less obvious when the bill is closed.|$|E

50|$|The red {{fox sparrow}} {{is a large}} sparrow with a length of 15-19 cm (6-7.5 inches), {{wingspan}} of 27 cm (10.5 inches) and an average weight of 32 grams (1.1 oz). The head is gray with a rufus crown auriculars or ear coverts. Throat is white with a rufus lateral stripe on each side. The <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> is yellow while the top transitions from yellow at the bottom to black at the top. The breast has reddish brown streaks with a messy central spot. The streaks continue down the flanks but the belly is generally white. The combination of distinct rufus and gray streaks on the back with a gray rump is diagnostic. Sexes are morphologically similar.|$|E
50|$|The pelican's pouch serves {{simply as}} a scoop. As the pelican pushes its bill underwater, the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> bows out, {{creating}} a large pouch which fills with water and fish. As it lifts its head, the pouch contracts, forcing out the water but retaining the fish. A group of 6 to 8 great white pelicans gather in a horseshoe formation in water to feed together. They dip their bills in unison, creating a circle of open pouches, ready to trap every fish in the area. Most feeding is cooperative and done in groups, especially in shallow waters where fish schools can be corralled easily, though they may also forage alone as well.|$|E
50|$|This bird has a black cap {{and orange}} bill that {{contrasts}} with the white body. With its long wings it looks tern-like and is about 40-43 cm long with a wingspan of 108 cm. The upper {{parts of the body}} are dark black and the underparts are white. The black cap on the head leaves the forehead and nape white. The wings are long and pointed with a white trailing edge. The short, forked tail is white with blackish central feathers. The long, thick bill is orange with a yellow tip and, like the other skimmers, has a lower mandible which is longer than the upper mandible. The legs and feet are red. The <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> is knife-like and flexible and the tip appears truncated. Young birds have bills that appear normal and with age the lower mandible grows. The upper mandible is capable of considerable mobility.|$|E
50|$|Analysis by {{engineering}} consultants, Buro Happold, {{concluded that}} most of the benefits from <b>lower</b> <b>bills</b> as a result of Green Deal installations would go to investors rather than occupants. Based on their gaming workshops, they estimate that consumers will see just 8% of any bill savings, with the remaining 92% going to investors. For a £20,000 investment that saved £500 a year, just £40 a year would accrue to occupants. The main benefit to occupants would be free refurbishment and increased comfort rather than financial savings.|$|R
40|$|Market-based {{electricity}} pricing provides consumers an op-portunity to <b>lower</b> their electric <b>bill</b> {{by shifting}} consump-tion to low price periods. In this paper, we explore how to <b>lower</b> electric <b>bills</b> without requiring consumer involvement using an intelligent charging system, called SmartCharge, and an on-site battery array to store low-cost energy for use during high-cost periods. SmartCharge’s algorithm reduces electricity costs by determining when to switch the home’s power supply between the grid and the battery array. The algorithm leverages a prediction model we develop, which forecasts future demand using statistical machine learning techniques. We evaluate SmartCharge in simulation {{using data from}} real homes to quantify its potential to <b>lower</b> <b>bills</b> {{in a range of}} scenarios. We show that typical savings to-day are 10 - 15 %, but increase linearly with rising electricity prices. We also find that SmartCharge deployed at only 22 % of 435 homes reduces the aggregate demand peak by 20 %. Finally, we analyze SmartCharge’s installation and mainte-nance costs. Our analysis shows that battery advancements, combined with an expected rise in electricity prices, have the potential to make the return on investment positive for the average home within the next few years. 1...|$|R
50|$|A common {{question}} asked is why woodpeckers {{do not get}} headaches. The forces produced during beak pounding and drumming, at high-speed acceleration and decelerations, {{are thought to be}} offset by a number of factors within the bill and skull. Dense spongy cranial bones, a relatively small brain, low cerebral spinal fluid, the unequal upper and <b>lower</b> <b>bills</b> of the beak and its position in relation to the brain work together to provide shock absorbency to the brain. Beak trajectory during pounding and drilling is straight and this reduces the forces of shearing and rotation.|$|R

50|$|This is a mid-sized grebe, varying from 28-45 cm {{in overall}} length. It weighs up to 600 g. Its {{coloration}} is unmistakable. The only grebe species it somewhat resembles is the unrelated red-necked grebe {{which is not}} found in South America. The only congener, the white-tufted grebe, does not look very similar. The color pattern of the Titicaca grebe is altogether {{similar to that of}} the red-necked grebe, but it has a darker belly, and a white (not light grey) throat patch that runs down the neck nearly to the breast. Due to the short wings, the rufous flanks can usually be seen. The ornamental plumes on the head are a vestigial version of those of the white-tufted grebe, but dark. Iris and the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> are yellow. Juveniles and non-breeding adults are duller, lack the ornamental plumes, and in the case of the former have rufous stripes on the sides of the head and more white on the neck, so that the rufous breast does not show in swimming birds.|$|E
5000|$|The adult {{great black-backed gull}} {{is fairly}} distinctive, as no other very large gull with blackish {{coloration}} on its upper-wings generally occurs in the North Atlantic. In other white-headed North Atlantic gulls, the mantle is generally a lighter gray color and, in some species, it is a light powdery color or even pinkish. It is grayish-black on the wings and back, with conspicuous, contrasting white [...] "mirrors" [...] at the wing tips. The legs are pinkish, and the bill is yellow or yellow-pink with some orange or red near tip of <b>lower</b> <b>bill.</b> The adult lesser black-backed gull (L. fuscus) is distinctly smaller, typically weighing about {{half as much as}} a great black-back. The lesser black-back has yellowish legs and a mantle that can range from slate-gray to brownish-colored but it is never as dark as the larger species. A few superficially similar dark-backed, fairly large gulls occur in the Pacific Ocean or in the tropics, all generally far outside this species' range, such as the slaty-backed (L. schistisagus), the western (L. occidentalis) and the kelp gull (L. dominicanus).|$|E

5000|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon {{had a very}} elastic mouth and throat, allowing for increased capacity, and a joint in the <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> enabled it to swallow acorns whole. It could store large quantities of food in its crop, which could expand to {{about the size of}} an orange, causing the neck to bulge and allowing a bird quickly to grab any food it discovered. The crop was described as being capable of holding at least 17 acorns or 28 beechnuts, 11 grains of corn, 100 maple seeds, plus other material; it was estimated that a {{passenger pigeon}} needed to eat about [...] of food a day to survive. If shot, a pigeon with a crop full of nuts would fall to the ground with a sound described as like the rattle of a bag of marbles. After feeding, the pigeons perched on branches and digested the food stored in their crop overnight. The pigeon could eat and digest 0.100 kg of acorns per day. At the historic population of three billion passenger pigeons, this amounted to 210,000,000 L of food a day. The pigeon could regurgitate food from its crop when more desirable food became available.|$|E
5000|$|Psittaciform {{diversity}} in South America and Australasia {{suggests that the}} order may have evolved in Gondwana, centred in Australasia. [...] The scarcity of parrots in the fossil record, however, presents difficulties in confirming the hypothesis, and there is currently a higher amount of fossil remains from the northern hemisphere in the early Cenozoic. Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 million years ago (Mya) (range 66-51 Mya) in Gondwana. The three major clades of Neotropical parrots originated about 50 Mya (range 57-41 Mya).A single 15 mm fragment from a large <b>lower</b> <b>bill</b> (UCMP 143274), found in deposits from the Lance Creek Formation in Niobrara County, Wyoming, had been {{thought to be the}} oldest parrot fossil and is presumed to have originated from the Late Cretaceous period, which makes it about 70 million years old.

50|$|This is {{a member}} of the Ixobrychus genus that {{contains}} many of the smallest herons in the world. Going on reported length, from 25 to 30 cm, this is perhaps the smallest species of heron. The weight is similar to other Ixobrychus species, reportedly from 60 to 150 g, averaging 75 - 110 g. The wingspan reportedly averages 45 to 50 cm. The male has a dark slate grey head and neck, with elongated head and neck feathers. The bill is dark overall, being black to dark green on top and yellow on the <b>lower</b> <b>bill.</b> The lores and orbital skin are blue to yellow green and the irises are red brown to dark red. The back, upper wings and other upper parts are dark slate grey. Its throat and upper breast are pale buff, darkening to tawny on the abdomen, heavily streaked black. The legs and feet are green yellow in front and yellow in back. In courtship legs and feet turn bright orange. The female is paler, with a more rufous tinge on its belly and yellow irises. The immature bird is a more buff and pale version than the adult. It is distinguished from the black bittern of Asia by its striped belly, dark neck tufts, shorter, darker bill and much smaller size. It is distinguished from the green and striated herons by its smaller size and slow flight, its pale and heavily streaked underparts, and its uniform (not barred) upper parts.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{materials}} that are more [...] "efficient" [...] in the building process today can be less expensive and energy intensive than using new building materials.
