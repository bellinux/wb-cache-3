40|$|Abstract. Backbones of propositional {{theories}} are literals that are true in every model. Backbones {{have been used}} for characterizing the hardness of decision and optimization problems. Moreover, back-bones find other applications. For example, backbones are often iden-tified during product configuration. Backbones can also improve the efficiency of solving computational problems related with proposi-tional theories. These include model enumeration, minimal model computation and prime implicant computation. This paper investi-gates algorithms for computing backbones of propositional theories, emphasizing the integration of these algorithms with modern SAT solvers. Experimental results, obtained on representative problem in-stances, indicate that the proposed algorithms are effective in practice and can be used for computing the <b>backbones</b> of <b>large</b> propositional theories. In addition, the experimental results indicate that proposi-tional theories can have <b>large</b> <b>backbones,</b> often representing a signif-icant percentage {{of the total number of}} variables. ...|$|R

However, although signaling protocols between IP routers and optical cross-connect networks have been standardized, <b>large</b> IP <b>backbones</b> are not typically deployed over optical cross-connect networks with automatic reconfigurability features, such as automatic restoration or dynamic establishment of new IP links. One of the most important criteria in determining whether an IP backbone should be carried over such an optical cross-connect network is economic viability. In this article we analyze and explore four architectures for a typical <b>large</b> ISP <b>backbone.</b> In contrast with some other published claims, our results suggest it is more economically attractive to bypass an intermediate cross-connect network, given current equipment and IP backbone network design requirements. However, for ISPs who also provide a large volume of private line services, we propose an integrated architecture for IP over optical cross-connect networks that may provide an attractive alternative for providing rapid and cost-effective restoration from network failures...|$|R

A virtual private network is provided by provisioning a set of permanent (long term) virtual circuits between customer endpoints on a <b>large</b> <b>backbone</b> network. This paper considers the problem of routing a set of permanent virtual circuit requests over a backbone network. Several factors make this routing problem complicated. Routing decisions must be made on-line without any knowledge of future request sets. Furthermore, frequent rerouting to correct inefficiencies that can result from the on-line routing decisions are not possible since rerouting creates a service disruption for the customer. Finally, the forward and reverse bandwidth of a virtual circuit must be routed over the same single path. Using an extensive set of simulations, this paper evaluates several different strategies for on-line permanent virtual circuit routing. We find that a strategy base [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{frame relay}} service offers virtual private {{networks}} to customers by provisioning {{a set of}} long-term private virtual circuits (PVCs) between customer endpoints on a <b>large</b> <b>backbone</b> network. During the provisioning of a PVC, routing decisions are made without any knowledge of future requests. Over time, these decisions can cause inefficiencies in the network and occasional offline rerouting of the PVCs is needed. In this paper, the offline PVC routing problem is formulated as an integer multicommodity flow problem with additional constraints and with an objective function that minimizes delays and network overload. We propose variants of a GRASP with path-relinking heuristic for this problem. Experimental results for realistic-size problems are reported, showing that the proposed heuristics are able to improve the solutions found with standard routing techniques. Moreover, the structure of our objective function provides a useful strategy for setting the appropriate value of its weight parameter, to achieve some quality of service (QoS) level defined by a desired maximum utilization rate. 1...|$|E

We compare this scoring function with three other functions on a large benchmark of 49 nonredundant test cases and show its superior performance, especially for the antibodyantigen category of test cases.
