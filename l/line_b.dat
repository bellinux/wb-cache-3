5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, {{in part due to}} the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic <b>Line</b> <b>B,</b> which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa was {{the first}} chief of {{government}} of Buenos Aires to be elected by popular vote, a change introduced by the amendment of the Constitution. He expanded the Buenos Aires Underground, adding new stations to Line D, starting the expansion of <b>Line</b> <b>B,</b> and establishing Line H. He established Roberto Goyeneche Avenue and the city's first bicycle path.|$|E

5|$|De la Rúa {{worked on}} the {{expansion}} of the Buenos Aires Underground. The first stations of the extended Line D, Olleros and José Hernández, were opened in 1997, Juramento was opened in 1999, and Congreso de Tucumán in 2000. He also started the works to extend the <b>Line</b> <b>B.</b> Carlos Menem started to transfer the control and financing of the underground system to the city, but the 2001 economic crisis halted the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, Line A and <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> have been {{extended}} westwards, adding {{a total of}} 4 stations to each line between 2003 and 2013. During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network's rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 the Lacroze Hermanos company won a {{concession}} to build another Underground line. The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in Buenos Aires {{as well as the}} Buenos Aires Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927 and this line became <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17–18 December 380,000 passengers travelled on the line's then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the Buenos Aires Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Line</b> <b>B</b> of Porto Metro links Póvoa de Varzim to Porto and {{the airport}} with two services: a {{standard}} and a shuttle (the Expresso). Through Verdes station, Metro trains link {{the city and}} the airport. This waiting station to reach Póvoa de Varzim is a small public park near the airport, and it literally means the green park station. The line operates on a former railway, which opened in 1875 and closed in 2002 to give way for the metro. The railway network was expanded and reached Famalicão in 1881, it was closed entirely in 1995 due to an accident with a bus and became a rail trail.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, <b>Line</b> <b>B</b> has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E

Trains slowed down when passing through these dimly lit stations. As the whole industrial area is slowly revitalized the stations were finally completed.|$|E
