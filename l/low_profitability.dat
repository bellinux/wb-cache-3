5|$|Carmarthenshire {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} county, {{apart from the}} southeastern part which at one time was heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In {{the north of the}} county the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. Nowadays the economy of the county depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. With the decline in its industrial base and the <b>low</b> <b>profitability</b> of the livestock sector, Carmarthenshire is economically one of the worst-performing regions in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had <b>low</b> <b>profitability</b> or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing {{executives}} that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

50|$|The {{real value}} of capital {{budgeting}} is to rank projects. Most organizations have many projects {{that could potentially}} be financially rewarding. Once it has been determined that a particular project has exceeded its hurdle, then it should be ranked against peer projects (e.g. - highest <b>Profitability</b> index to <b>lowest</b> <b>Profitability</b> index). The highest ranking projects should be implemented until the budgeted capital has been expended.|$|R
40|$|Code {{optimisation}} algorithms using bi-directional {{data flow}} dependencies {{have become increasingly}} important in recent years. The use of these algorithms faces two difficulties in practice: (a) <b>Low</b> <b>profitabilities,</b> and (b) high solution costs. This paper develops {{a new approach to}} the use of bi-directional dependencies using the concept of edge placement. This is shown to yield higher profitabilities of optimisation. An efficient solution method for such algorithms is also developed. The complexity of this method is shown to be bounded by O(e) operations, where e is the number of edges in the program flow graph. Ths is comparable to the complexity of uni-directional flow algorithms commonly used in optimisation. © AC...|$|R
2500|$|In {{reply to}} this kind of criticism, {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxist academics such as Andrew Kliman, Michael Roberts and Guglielmo Carchedi admit that the crisis may not be directly caused by an insufficient mass of profit to valorize all the capital there is (the traditional Fraina-Grossmann-Mattick argument). After all, this is not really credible in view of the great financial crisis of 2007–2009, which arose out of a financial panic about dodgy securitized products that occurred when average business profitability was high. Rather, these Marxists argue, the historically <b>low</b> average <b>profitability</b> of industry explains why depressed conditions persist, instead of a quick recovery happening after a credit bubble pops. Thus, <b>low</b> industrial <b>profitability</b> is the [...] "underlying factor" [...] explaining general economic stagnation.|$|R

The research method is based on cost - benefit analysis and comparative analysis of the situation on the European energy market. The conclusions results show that the specific investment for green energy production is generally higher than the specific investment for conventional energy production.

Production practices considered include the traditional system (TRAD), unconditioned plastic greenhouses (GHP), and three types production systems utilizing air-conditioned greenhouses (CGH 1, CGH 2 and CGH 3). Targets to cover total production costs and total cost plus additional profits were modeled. Results indicated that CGH 3 is the most profitable on average and had the lowest potential for losses. GHP was intermediate in both average profitability and risks. TRAD had the <b>lowest</b> <b>profitability</b> and the highest risk.

Expected net returns and risk (measured as the expected sum of negative deviations of the solution results from targeted income) are important factors shown to affect production practices chosen by the model...|$|R

From Copenhagen the airline inaugurated with flights to Alicante, Athens, Bologna, Lisbon, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Pristina and Sarajevo.

Snowflake then announced two new destinations from Stockholm {{from the start}} of the winter program in October: Lyon, Beograd and Beirut. The latter two were mainly aimed at Lebanese expatriates. A new fare scheme was introduced from 1 October, whereby there were eight price levels, ranging from €58 to €228. Meanwhile, it started with discounted booking fees when tickets were ordered online. In November Snowflake announced that it would bull out of the Dubline and Barcelona services, stating <b>low</b> <b>profitability.</b> Scandinavian Airlines instead started to serve the Dublin route.|$|E

In contrast, when overvalued assets are held by ordinary savers, the consequences for financial stability are less severe. We show that <b>low</b> bank <b>profitability</b> and a generous financial safety net for banks are important determinants in their decisions to take risks...|$|R

First, within {{the sample of}} firms that have low market capitalisations, stocks with <b>low</b> past <b>profitability</b> ('laggers') bring returns that are significantly {{higher than those of}} stocks with high past profitability ('leaders'). Second, the size premium is generated largely by small laggers. Moreover, both patterns are particularly pronounced at earnings-announcement dates, suggesting that unexpected earnings growth can explain a portion of the abnormal returns to small stocks. Since these findings point to market inefficiency, they are especially important for the revenue management of money managers who invest in small stocks. small-firm effect; forecasting; revenue management; return anomalies; small firms; overreaction; low market capitalisation; size premium; earnings growth; unexpected growth; small stocks. ...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{conceptual}} framework, we develop {{the hypothesis that}} part-time farmers invest in less profitable products than full-time farms, due to the necessary minimum labour requirements which entering and running profitable production processes require. Descriptive statistics for Swiss farms show some indications for this hypothesis, like a much lower total revenue and lower agricultural income of part-time farms, despite a comparable value of the farm’s assets. A regression analysis for the period 1996 - 2005 confirms that Swiss part-time farms {{tend to focus on}} products with <b>low</b> labour <b>profitability.</b> This may explain why part-time farming in Switzerland is less developed than in most other European countries, and raises the question whether part-time farming offers a solution for structural change process in small-structured agricultural systems affected by imperfections on factor markets. farms, part-time, profitability, Switzerland...|$|R
