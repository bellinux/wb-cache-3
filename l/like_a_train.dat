25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E

Examples include automated teller machines (ATM), point of sale (POS) touchscreens at restaurants, self-service checkouts used in a retail store, airline self-ticketing and check-in, information kiosks in a public space, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> station or a museum, and monitors or control screens in an embedded industrial application which employ a real-time operating system (RTOS).|$|E
25|$|At {{the three}} Reinhard camps {{the victims were}} killed by the exhaust fumes of {{stationary}} diesel engines. Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial, but the women's hair was cut before death. At Treblinka, in order to calm the arriving victims, the arrival platform was made to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> station, complete with fake clock. Majdanek used Zyklon-B gas in its gas chambers. In contrast to Auschwitz, the three Reinhard camps were quite small. At these camps, most of the initial victims were buried in pits, but in 1942 in order to hide the evidence of the extermination, the exhumation of the bodies and cremation of them was begun. Sobibór and Bełżec began the process in late 1942 but Treblinka did not start until March 1943. The bodies were burned in open fireplaces and the remaining bones were crushed into powder.|$|E

5000|$|His {{words about}} Ilayaraja: [...] "Illaiyaraja {{is a hard}} taskmaster and a perfectionist. It's really tough singing for him, {{because he does not}} let go till he gets the result he wants. It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>training</b> ground for any singer, and singing for him".|$|R
500|$|The {{choreographer}} Gregg Burge {{confirmed the}} influence, although {{they intended to}} do a more contemporary version of it.

500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{features}} greater background interaction {{than the}} original, such as {{levels in the}} dark. Williamson's favourite addition to the game was the sponge in the kitchen, which forced players to time their entry onto and exit from a platform. He also liked the toilet seat track. David Darling initially disliked the physics, stating he liked the way the first game achieved skids without feeling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> manoeuvring. It was worked on until it {{was similar to the}} original, and ultimately it worked [...] "perfectly". According to WIlliamson, the team spent [...] "enormous amounts of time" [...] testing the game.|$|E
500|$|According to Townshend, Moon began {{destroying}} {{hotel rooms}} when the Who {{stayed at the}} Berlin Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing {{cost as much as}} £300,000 ($500,000). These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, [...] "He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> ride you couldn't stop." ...|$|E

500|$|The reviews {{have stood}} the test of time and the season still remains a huge {{critical}} favorite. Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that, [...] "the second season is still the show’s best season to date." [...] The site added, [...] "I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show’s best season to date: season 2." [...] calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season, [...] "the elevator", [...] "the walkway", [...] "Joe’s bar, [...] " [...] Meredith’s [...] "Pick me" [...] speech". and the [...] "memorable patients" [...] adding, [...] " [...] I want two people stuck on a pole (Into You <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Train)</b> or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye, and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate. More than anything, I want them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E

500|$|Unlike Davis' {{previous}} recordings, the cadenzas throughout Agharta {{were mostly}} played by Fortune and Cosey. Fortune alternated between soprano and alto saxophones and the flute, performing with a [...] "substance and structure" [...] Gilmore believed {{was very much}} indebted to John Coltrane during his A Love Supreme (1965) period. He performed his longest alto saxophone solo on [...] "Right Off", which opened the record's second disc in a [...] "propulsive" [...] segment Gilmore said [...] "flies by <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> ride in a dream, where scenes flash past the window in a fascinating and illusive dream". Cosey played a Guild S-100 electric guitar and heavily employed chromaticism, dissonance, and feedback in his improvisations on Agharta. He alternated between several effects pedals set up underneath his table of percussion instruments, including a fuzzbox for distorting guitar sounds and two different wah-wah pedals he used during solos or when playing more mellow tones. Cosey often arranged his guitar strings in different places on the fretboard and never played in standard tuning, using at least 36 different tuning systems, each of which altered the style and sound of his playing. According to Tzvi Gluckin from Premier Guitar, his experimental guitar playing was rooted in the blues and displayed a sense of phrasing that was aggressive and [...] "blistering" [...] yet [...] "somehow also restrained", particularly in his control of feedback.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{means of}} public road {{transport}} {{in the city}} center is the Cavalier (...) , an electric vehicle operated by LPP since May 2009. There are three such vehicles in Ljubljana. The ride is free {{and there are no}} stations because it can be stopped anywhere. It can carry up to five passengers; most of them are elderly people and tourists. The Cavalier drives in the car-free zone in the Ljubljana downtown. The first line links Čop Street, Wolf Street and the Hribar Embankment, whereas the second links Town Square, Upper Square, and Old Square. There is also a tractor with wagons decorated to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> for tourists in Ljubljana, linking Cyril and Methodius Square in the city center with Ljubljana Castle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff at}} Variety {{magazine}} lauded the {{acting in the}} film, writing, [...] "Matewan is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> coming down the track. Among the memorable characters is Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper), a young union organizer who comes to Matewan to buck the bosses. With his strong face and Harrison Ford good-looks, Cooper gives the film its heartbeat...Most notable of the black workers is 'Few Clothes' Johnson (James Earl Jones), a burly good-natured man with a powerful presence and a quick smile. Jones' performance practically glows in the dark. Also a standout is Sayles veteran David Strathairn as the sheriff with quiet integrity who puts {{his life on the}} line." ...|$|E
