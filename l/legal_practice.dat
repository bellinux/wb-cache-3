40|$|For {{more than}} forty years, {{jurisprudence}} {{has been dominated by}} the HartDworkin debate. The debate starts from the premise that our <b>legal</b> <b>practices</b> generate rights and obligations that are distinctively legal, and the question at issue is how the content of these rights and obligations is determined. Positivists say that their content is determined ultimately or exclusively by social facts. Anti-positivists say that moral facts must play a part in determining their content. In this Essay, I argue that the debate rests on a mistake. Our <b>legal</b> <b>practices</b> do not generate rights and obligations that are distinctively legal. At best, they generate moral rights and obligations, some of which we label legal. I defend this view by drawing analogies with other normative practices, like making promises, posting rules, and playing games. And I try to explain why it looks like <b>legal</b> <b>practices</b> generate distinctively <b>legal</b> rights and obligations even though they do not. I conclude with some thoughts about the questions that jurisprudence should pursue {{in the wake of the}} Hart-Dworkin debate...|$|R
