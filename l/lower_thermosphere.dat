By using the GITM model, Wang and Liu (2015) showed an enhanced Δ Ne wave in NA (180 ^∘W- 0 ^∘ GLon) produced by an upward-propagating migrating tide when compared to those caused by in situ processes. However, the TIEGCM shows a reduced Δ Ne wave in the NA sector (see the left-hand side of the bottom panel in Fig.  2). The reason for this contradiction is that the GITM only includes the tidal wind, but excludes the tidal neutral compositions in the coupling between the <b>lower</b> atmosphere and <b>thermosphere,</b> while the TIEGCM includes both disturbances in the lower and upper atmosphere coupling.|$|R

The analysis is performed between ± 45 ? latitude during 2011, when reliable and continuous measurements are available. With geomagnetic and solar effects removed, DE 3 and the UFKW are identified as dominant sources of day-to-day variability at both heights. Evidence is found for the vertical propagation of DE 3 and the UFKW from the <b>lower</b> to middle <b>thermosphere</b> over a range of time scales. Over 60 % of the variance due to DE 3 and the UFKW at 260 ?km is traceable to variability occurring at 100 ?km.

Spectral and temporal analyses of the SABER and GOCE data also reveal the presence of sidebands due to the modulation of DE 3 by the UFKW. These secondary waves are responsible for up to 10 % to 20 % of the longitudinal and day-to-day variability. Overall, vertical propagating waves together with sidebands from DE 3 -UFKW nonlinear interactions are responsible for 60 % to 80 % of the total variability, while geomagnetic and solar effects correlated with ap and F 10. 7 account for less than 20 % of the variance.

40|$|The lack of {{agreement}} between our previously computed values and those measured by Viking of the N- 15 :N- 14 isotope enhancement ratio has {{led us to}} reevaluate our model of the Martian ionosphere. In previous models, {{we were unable to}} reproduce the ion profiles measured by the RPA on Viking using electron temperatures that were higher that the ion temperatures. When we increased the electron temperatures to 2500 - 3000 K and with a zero flux upper boundary condition, the ion densities at high altitudes exceeded the measured values by a large factor. We found that we can better fit the observed profiles if we impose a loss process at the upper boundary of our model. If the horizontal fluxes of ions do not constitute a net loss of ions, then the escape of N due to dissociative recombination is also inhibited and better agreement with the measured isotope ratio is found. The production of escaping nitrogen atoms is closely related to the production of thermospheric odd nitrogen; therefore, the densities of NO measured by Viking provide a convenient check on our nitrogen escape model. Our standard model NO densities are less that the measured values by a factor of 2 - 3, as are those of previous models. We find that reasonable agreement can be obtained by assuming that the rate coefficient for loss of odd nitrogen in the reaction of N with NO is smaller at temperatures that prevail in the <b>lower</b> Martian <b>thermosphere</b> than the standard value, which applies to temperatures of 200 - 400 K.

30|$|Storm-time {{alterations}} to {{the equatorial}} zonal electric field, as already mentioned, {{fall into two}} broad groups, namely those due to a prompt penetration electric field and those due to a disturbance dynamo electric field (Blanc and Richmond, 1980) {{both of which are}} manifested at equatorial latitudes and are the result of a magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction (Basu et al., 2001; Sobral et al., 2001). The dawn-dusk Interplanetary Electric Field (IEF) is found to influence the ionosphere electron density distribution and the dynamics of the ionosphere, causing drifts and changes in ionospheric parameters such as the ionospheric drift velocity, foF 2 and h′F (Davis et al., 1997; Fejer, 2002; Biktash et al., 2005). The strong upwelling of the atmosphere transports oxygen-depleted, or nitrogen-rich, air up from much <b>lower</b> in the <b>thermosphere</b> into the F region (Mayr and Volland, 1972; Mayr et al., 1978; Prolss, 1980). The nitrogen-rich/oxygen-depleted air causes a reduction in the ionospheric electron density and oxygen rich/nitrogen-depleted air causes an increase in the ionospheric electron density (Zhang et al., 2004).|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} neutral winds {{also play a}} very important role in producing stormtime changes in the ionosphere. During a geomagnetic storm, intense Joule and particle heating causes a strong upwelling of the atmosphere around the auroral oval. The strong upwelling of the atmosphere transports oxygen-depleted, or nitrogen-rich, air up from much <b>lower</b> in the <b>thermosphere</b> into the F region (Mayr and Volland, 1972; Mayr et al., 1978; Prolss, 1980). Neutral winds then redistribute this nitrogen-rich/oxygen-depleted air over much of the high-latitude region and part of the mid-latitude region. The nitrogen-rich/oxygen-depleted air causes a reduction in the ionospheric electron density, and oxygen-rich/nitrogen-depleted air causes an increase in the ionospheric electron density. The transport is strongest during post-midnight hours owing to wind surges arising from ion convection and the associated momentum transfer to neutrals. It is known that, during daytime, the bottom side of the ionosphere (130 – 200 km) is “photochemically” governed, where photodissociation of molecular oxygen in the Schumann-Runge continuum (135 – 175 nm) leads to the generation of atomic oxygen, which, in turn, leads to the formation of ionization. At the same time, the ionization loss processes are mainly controlled by molecular nitrogen through chemistry. As a result, the ratio (O/N 2) at any time is taken as a measure of the net ionization in the lower F region (Forbes, 2007).|$|R
40|$|We have {{computed}} {{the production}} rates and densities of odd nitrogen {{species in the}} Martian atmosphere using updated rate coefficients and a revised ionosphere-thermosphere model. We find that the computed densities of NO are somewhat smaller than those measured by Viking 1, but reasonable agreement {{can be obtained by}} assuming that the rate coefficient for loss of odd nitrogen in the reaction of N with NO is smaller at temperatures that prevail in the <b>lower</b> Martian <b>thermosphere</b> (about 130 – 160 K) than the standard value, which applies to temperatures of 200 – 400 K. We have also modeled the escape fluxes of N from the Martian atmosphere due to photodissociation, photodissociative ionization, and electron impact dissociative ionization of N 2, ion-molecule reactions, and dissociative recombination of N 2 +. The magnitudes of the latter two sources depend strongly on the N 2 + density profile, for which there are no in situ measurements. The revised ionospheric model, which incorporates the larger electron temperatures recently derived from Viking measurements (Hanson and Mantes, 1988) and a loss process for ions at high altitudes (Shinagawa and Cravens, 1989), differs substantially from those of previous models (Fox and Dalgarno, 1979; 1983; Fox, 1989). In dissociative recombination of N 2 + sufficient energy for escape is available only when the products are N(4 S) + N(2 D), and the results are therefore sensitive to assumptions made about the product yields. Unfortunately, the experimental values for the yields of excited states of N in dissociative recombination (Queffelec et al., 1985) differ significantly from those obtained in recent ab initio calculations (Guberman, 1991). When the theoretical data are employed, the computed isotope ratio enhancement and the initial column density obtained are about 2. 6 and 1. 0 × 1023 cm− 2, respectively. The existence of a dense early atmosphere is consistent with this model. If the initial CO 2 pressure is assumed to be 2 bars, exponential loss of the atmosphere with a time constant of about 2. 2 × 1016 s (7 × 108 years) reproduces the measured isotope ratio...|$|R

The potential energy density distributions served as the basis to compute gravity wave source momentum flux used in a Mars dynamical model, marking {{the first time that}} a numerical study of Mars 2 ̆ 7 gravity waves was observationally constrained. The gravity wave source spectrum is believed to include a stationary component from topographic forcing and a non-stationary component from atmospheric tides with large zonal wavenumbers. The model used was a Mars-specific version of the Hybrid Lindzen-Matsuno gravity wave parameterization that was created and integrated into the time-dependent, two-dimensional QNLM model for Mars. Due to the non-stationary waves in the gravity wave spectrum, the effect on predicted zonal wind and temperature fields was profound, particularly in the upper atmosphere above 100 km altitude where Mars 2 ̆ 7 atmosphere is poorly observed. At solstice, the middle atmosphere zonal jets were closed near 80 km, and upper atmosphere zonal winds were significantly diminished from 120 - 140 m s- 1 to near zero. Meridional circulation increased to over 50 m s- 1 at altitudes where gravity wave breaking occurred, and adiabatic heating above the winter pole was enhanced. The model results were particularly sensitive to the prescribed phase speed distribution, and multiple phase speed spectra were evaluated to assess sensitivity. The effects of the non-stationary tidal components in the gravity wave spectrum indicate that Mars 2 ̆ 7 GCMs may be underestimating their contribution to middle and upper atmosphere forcing, but open questions remain with respect to the phase speed distribution of non-stationary components and the relative contribution to momentum flux of stationary and non-stationary waves.

50|$|The vehicle started encountering more {{significant}} air density in the <b>lower</b> <b>thermosphere</b> at about 400000 ft, at around Mach 25, 8200 m/s. The vehicle {{was controlled by}} a combination of RCS thrusters and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude, producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By {{the end of the last}} turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.|$|E
50|$|A {{second source}} of energy input into the {{thermosphere}} is solar wind energy which is transferred to the magnetosphere by mechanisms that are not well understood. One possible way to transfer energy is via a hydrodynamic dynamo process. Solar wind particles penetrate into the polar regions of the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic field lines are essentially vertically directed. An electric field is generated, directed from dawn to dusk. Along the last closed geomagnetic field lines with their footpoints within the auroral zones, field aligned electric currents can flow into the ionospheric dynamo region where they are closed by electric Pedersen and Hall currents. Ohmic losses of the Pedersen currents heat the <b>lower</b> <b>thermosphere</b> (see e.g., Magnetospheric electric convection field). In addition, penetration of high energetic particles from the magnetosphere into the auroral regions enhance drastically the electric conductivity, further increasing the electric currents and thus Joule heating. During quiet magnetospheric activity, the magnetosphere contributes perhaps by a quarter to the thermosphere's energy budget. This is about 250 K of the exospheric temperature in eq.(2). During very large activity, however, this heat input can increase substantially, {{by a factor of}} four or more.
