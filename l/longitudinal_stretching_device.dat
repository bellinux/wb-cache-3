5000|$|It {{is useful}} to {{classify}} causes of calving into first, second, and third order processes. [...] First order processes {{are responsible for the}} overall rate of calving at the glacier scale. The first order cause of calving is <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching,</b> which controls the formation of crevasses. When crevasses penetrate the full thickness of the ice, calving will occur. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> is controlled by friction at the base and edges of the glacier, glacier geometry and water pressure at the bed. These factors, therefore, exert the primary control on calving rate.|$|R

A stretch-dependent increase in reactivity was observed only in rat third order mesenteric arteries. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>stretch</b> > 20 % (force equal to 0. 23 +/- 0. 04 mN) optimises vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline and phenylephrine in rat third order mesenteric arteries.

Similarly, stretch had no affect on pressure-dependent myogenic responses in rat mid-cerebral arteries. Endothelium-independent and endothelium-dependent mechanisms of vasorelaxation were unaffected by stretch in rat third order mesenteric arteries. Likewise, stretch did not affect vasoreactivity in rat mid-cerebral and human subcutaneous resistance arteries. Our results show that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch</b> in isobaric-mounted rat third order mesenteric arteries is an important methodological consideration.

Specifically, magnetic forces were used to mediate the cyclic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> of tissues composed of Janus magnetic cellular spheroids (JMCSs), {{as part of a}} post-processing method for enhancing the deposition and mechanical properties of an extracellular matrix (ECM). The purpose was to accelerate the conventional tissue maturation process via novel post-processing techniques that accelerate the functional, structural, and mechanical mimicking of native tissues. The results of a forty-day study of JMCSs indicated an expression of collagen I, collagen IV, elastin, and fibronectin, which are important vascular ECM proteins. Most notably, the subsequent exposure of fused tissue sheets composed of JMCSs to magnetic forces did not hinder the production of these key proteins. Quantitative results demonstrate that cyclic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> of the tissue sheets mediated by these magnetic forces increased the Young’s modulus and induced collagen fiber alignment over a seven day period, when compared to statically conditioned controls. Specifically, the elastin and collagen content of these dynamically-conditioned sheets were 35 - and three-fold greater, respectively, at seven days compared to the statically-conditioned controls at three days.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch</b> and a pressure-induced inhomogeneous radial {{deformation}} on the scattering of antiplane elastic waves from a cylindrical cavity is determined. Three popular non-linear strain energy functions are considered: the neo-Hookean, the Mooney-Rivlin and a two-term Arruda-Boyce model. A new method is developed to analyse and solve the governing wave equations. It exploits their properties to determine an asymptotic solution in the far-field, which is then used to derive a boundary condition to numerically evaluate the equations local to the cavity. This method {{could be applied to}} any linear ordinary differential equation whose inhomogeneous coefficients tend to a constant as its independent variable tends to infinity. The effect of the pre-stress is evaluated by considering the scattering cross-section. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch</b> is found to decrease the scattered power emanating from the cavity, whereas a compression increases it. The effect of the pressure difference depends on the strain energy function employed.

A detailed comparison of multi-mode computations with single-mode solution is presented {{in order to examine}} the differences in the predicted viscoelastic behavior {{and the role of the}} fluid relaxation spectrum. The evolution in the transient Trouton ratio at different deformation rates is compared with experimental measurements and with the theoretical predictions of ideal homogeneous uniaxial elongation. Simulations of the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> using the multi-mode viscoelastic model demonstrate a significant improvement in the agreement between the predicted and observed extensional viscosity at short times. The computed Trouton ratio is also in good agreement with theoretical expectations for ideal homogeneous uniaxial extension, despite the strongly nonhomogeneous viscoelastic necking of the fluid column observed during elongation in the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device.</b> Following the cessation of elongation, numerical simulations predict an interesting and complex evolution in the kinematics of the fluid filament. Initially the tensile stresses in the column relax in the non-linear form predicted theoretically, indicating that filament <b>stretching</b> <b>devices</b> can be used to monitor transient extensional stress relaxation, provided that the evolution of the tensile force at the end-plate and the filament radius at the mid-plane are carefully measured. However, at longer times after cessation of stretching, the local extension rate at the axial mid-plane begins to increase rapidly, leading to a 'necking failure' that is greatly accelerated compared to that expected in a corresponding Newtonian filament. The calculations show that this unstable necking is not driven solely by the surface tension but also by the viscoelasticity of the fluid, and is coupled with significant elastic recoil of the material near the end-plates. The rate of necking in the column is a sensitive function of the extensional viscosity predicted by the constitutive model, in particular the magnitude and the rate of strain-hardening that occurs during uniaxial elongation. This phenomenon can also be simply and accurately described by an appropriate set of coupled one-dimensional thin filament equations that use the finite element computations to provide a suitable initial condition for the axial distribution of the polymeric stresses in the filament.

These cells contain structures that {{are sensitive to}} mechanical stretch and transduce this signal into a biochemical response. By altering the major axis of biaxial, mechanical stretch, I hypothesized that different signaling pathways and transcription regulators would be activated and lead to divergent gene expression profiles in cardiac myocytes. To investigate the effect of stretch axis, cardiac myocytes were cultured on a micropatterned substrate, and the primary stretch axis was applied either parallel or transverse to the myofibril direction. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to study whole genomic expression changes after acute cardiac myocyte stretch. After 30 minutes of stretch, 53 and 168 genes were considered differentially expressed (DE) from transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch,</b> respectively. After 4 hours, the number of DE genes increased to 795 in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch</b> while it decreased to 35 in transverse stretch. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis indicated enrichment of transcription factor (TF) activity and protein kinase activity by both <b>stretch</b> axes; whereas <b>longitudinal</b> but not transverse stretch induced expression of genes involved in sarcomere organization and cytoskeletal protein binding. Although researchers have identified sensors, pathways, and TFs involved in cardiac mechanotransduction, I, for the first time, integrated this information into a logic-based network model of cardiac myocyte stretch signaling.

In this thesis three key elements of this model are tested: 1) the role of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> {{as a result of}} velocity gradients, which pre-conditions ice at the glacier terminus for calving failure; 2) the accurate prediction of crevasse depths from strain rates, for inclusion within a calving model as a calving criterion; 3) the role of dynamically induced thinning (as a result of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> at an accelerating glacier) in causing further acceleration and calving retreat and the onset of a dynamic thinning feedback through reduced basal pressure. Field results show that longitudinal strain rates are important controls on calving glaciers, controlling both dynamic thinning and crevasse depths. Crevasse-depth models proposed by Van der Veen (1998 a, 1998 b) and Nye (1957) work well in predicting crevasse depths based on measured strain rates. The latter in particular is suitable for inclusion as a calving criterion when modified with a yield criterion. The importance of water in enhancing propagation of crevasses is demonstrated through modelling studies, and is implicitly included in the calving model. Measured rates of dynamic thinning at Breiðamerkurjökull, a glacier in South East Iceland, confirm the importance of this process within a calving model and results from a simple 1 -D model show that the new sliding law not only predicts velocities effectively, but can also predict the position of a calving terminus based on strain rates and the calving criterion. Suggestions are made for further more detailed modelling, including time evolution and longitudinal stress gradients, to apply the model to a range of glaciers and to predict the response of calving glaciers to climatic and environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for realizing the {{continuously}} tunable spectrum based on monatomic carbon chains. By hybrid density functional calculations, we first {{show that the}} direct band gap of monatomic carbon chains change continuously from 1. 58 to 3. 8 eV as strain is applied from - 5 to 10 % to the chain, with separated Van Hove singularity peaks enhanced. To realize this tunability, a realistic <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> is proposed by contacting the chain with graphene sheets, which can apply up to 9 % elongation to the chain, yielding tunable light-emitting wavelengths from 345 to 561 nm...|$|R
40|$|Using {{ab initio}} total energy calculations, {{we show that}} bilayer systems of ZnO nanoribbons, (ZnO) (2) NR, doped with Co atoms exhibit a piezomagnetic behavior. We find the {{formation}} of energetically stable zigzag chains of Co atoms along the edge sites of (ZnO) (2) NR's, Co(Zn(chain)) -(ZnO) (2) NR. At the ground state, the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic states are very close in energy, whereas upon <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretch,</b> parallel to the nanoribbon growth direction, it becomes ferromagnetic. Further electronic structure calculations indicate that not only the magnetic state but also the electronic structure of CoZn(chain) -(ZnO) (2) NR can be tuned by the mechanical stretch. In this case, we find that stretched NR's exhibit dispersive unpaired electronic states within the (ZnO) (2) NR band gap.

40|$|Summary. Background: Recent data {{indicate}} that stretching forces cause a dramatic decrease in clot volume accompanied by gross conformational changes of fibrin structure. Objec-tive: The present study attempts to characterize the lytic susceptibility of fibrin exposed to mechanical stress {{as a model for}} fibrin structures observed in vivo. Methods and results: The relevance of stretched fibrin models was substantiated by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) eval-uation of human thrombi removed during surgery, where surface fibrin fibers were observed to be oriented in the direction of shear forces, whereas interior fibers formed a random spatial meshwork. These structural variations were modeled in vitro with fibrin exposed to adjustable mechanical stress. After two- and three-fold <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> (2 · S, 3 · S) the median fiber diameter and pore area i...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} validation of an equibiaxial <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> in which cells are confined to regions of homogeneous strain. Using this device, we seek to overcome a significant limitation of existing equibiaxial <b>stretching</b> <b>devices,</b> in which strains are not homogeneous over the entire region of cell culture. We cast PDMS in a mold to produce a membrane with a cylindrical wall incorporated in the center, which was used to confine cell monolayers to the central membrane region subjected to homogeneous equibiaxial strain. We demonstrated {{that the presence of}} the wall to hold the culture medium did not affect strain homogeneity over the majority of the culture surface and also showed that cells adhered well onto the PDMS membranes. We used our device in cyclic strain experiments and demonstrated strain-dependent changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and tyrosine phosphorylation upon cell stretching. Furthermore, we examined cell responses to very small magnitudes of strain ranging from 1 % to 6 % and were able to observe a graduated increase in ERK phosphorylation in response to these strains. Collectively, we were able to study cellular biochemical response {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and sensitivity to fine changes in substrate strain. Because we have designed our device along the lines of existing equibiaxial stretching technologies, we believe that our innovations can be incorporated into existing systems. This device would provide a useful addition to the set of tools applied for in vitr...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{steady state}} vibration {{analysis of a}} wide class of plane structures is analyzed. Both the finite element method and incremental harmonic balance method are used. The usual beam element is adopted in which the nonlinear effect arising from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stretching</b> has been taken into account. Based on the geometric nonlinear finite element analysis, the nonlinear dynamic equations including quadratic and cubic nonlinearities are derived. These equations are solved by the incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method. To show the effectiveness and versatility of this method, some typical examples {{for a wide variety}} of vibration problems including fundamental resonance, super- and sub-harmonic resonance, and combination resonance of plane structures such as beams, shallow arches and frames are computed. Most of these examples have not been studied by other researchers before. Comparison with previous results are also made. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
