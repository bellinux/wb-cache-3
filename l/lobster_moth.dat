50|$|The Lobster caterpillar, (Stauropus alternus), {{also known}} as <b>lobster</b> <b>moth</b> or crab caterpillar, is a moth of the Notodontidae family. It {{is found in the}} {{north-eastern}} Himalaya, Sri Lanka, Sundaland, the Philippines, Sulawesi and the southern Moluccas.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} on 15 May 1947 in Aberdeen, Scotland. He was brought up there, and in Ghana, England and Malaysia. He {{is the author of}} three {{acclaimed}} novels: The Duchess's Dragonfly (1993, Phoenix House, Orion). Natterjack, (1996, Faber & Faber) and <b>Lobster</b> <b>Moth</b> (1999, Fourth Estate). He is currently working on three novels about women.|$|E
5000|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{are usually}} hairless, but may have tubercules, spines, or humps (Scoble 1995), and often rest with both ends raised. The last set of prolegs is frequently vestigial, {{or may be}} long, with glands that can be everted. Some larvae undergo shape modification and colour changes with each instar (Weller, 1992). Notodontid larvae are notable for their often bizarre shapes, and some have chemical defenses (cyanic acid, formic acid, and other ketones: Blum, 1981) not commonly found in other Lepidoptera (Weller 1992). Schizura unicornis and S. badia have a mixture of formic acid, acetic acid and other compounds which they spray accurately at their attacker (Attygalle et al., 1993).The larvae of some species are truly extraordinary: That of the Puss Moth has a fearsome-looking [...] "face" [...] and two long whip-like [...] "tails" [...] (actually highly modified prolegs) and it rears both ends in a threatening display when disturbed. The larva of the <b>Lobster</b> <b>Moth</b> is even more remarkable, resembling a crustacean. Others, such as Cerura vinulamimic {{the edge of a}} leaf that has been damaged and is turning brown (they rest and feed {{along the edge of the}} leaf).|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study the population dynamics of <b>Lobster</b> <b>moth</b> (Neostauropus alternus Walker) on pigeonpea and its relation with different weather variables during kharif season of 2013 - 14 and 2014 - 15 under unprotected conditions at Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India. The results revealed {{that the incidence of}} this insect commenced from the 34 th standard week and it remained active up to 41 st standard week of both the years. The insect showed one peak of its population during both the years. The maximum number of N. alternus was recorded on 37 th standard week (5. 6 larvae per plant) in 2013 - 14 while in 2014 - 15, population of N. alternus was highest in 38 th standard week (4. 8 larvae per plant). Correlation studies indicated that larval population of N. alternus exhibited a significant positive correlation with temperature whereas a significant negative correlation was established with relative humidity. Other abiotic factors had no significant effect on this insect pest population...|$|E
