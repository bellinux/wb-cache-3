40|$|Artificial {{breeding}} bypasses {{the effect}} of natural selection and, inevitably, subjects game birds to selection by breeding technology. For this reason, we evaluated whether different breeding technologies, carried out for six generations, were enough to differentiate two grey partridge lines. Two lines of grey partridges, obtained from the same population, were used: the animals of the line "broody" had been hatched directly by their own mothers for six generations; the animals of the line "incubator" had always been hatched in incubators from eggs laid by cage-reared grey partridges. Offspring from the two lines were reared under the same conditions and 2 years of production were monitored. Results showed that grey partridges of the "broody" line had a shorter and delayed laying period and, consequently, a lower egg production than the "incubator" line.

40|$|Title of the paper: Genetic {{analysis}} <b>of</b> the <b>laying</b> {{pattern in}} floor management {{in terms of}} new performance parameters for breeding In order to facilitate a specific selection <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> hens which are suitable for alternative housing systems, it will be of advantage if the individual hens were tested in their later husbandry environment. Therefore, a new technology has been developed, the »Weihenstephan Funnel Nest Box«, which enables the automatic recording of these essential performance and nesting behaviour parameters of the individual hens in a group housing system. The exact oviposition times <b>of</b> 263 <b>laying</b> hens <b>of</b> Lohmann Silver line were recorded and used to analyse the laying pattern. Some results which were already pointed out in literature were thus confirmed, other brought new cognitions {{in terms of the}} oviposition pattern and about the pause following a laying sequence. A positive genetic correlation between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a <b>laying</b> sequence and the subsequent pause durations (r g =+ 0. 49) confirmed the tendency to longer breaks following an increasing laying sequence. The duration of a break was, however, not such an essential criteria for the productivity of a hen. More important in this context was the number of pauses which rises constantly with the number <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> sequences over the whole observation period. When the hens laid in shorter sequences, it was observed that the proportion of sequences grew, which was reflected as smaller number of registered eggs per hen (r g =− 0. 73). The logical conclusion was the highly positive correlation between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a <b>laying</b> sequence and the number of registered eggs (r g =+ 0. 82). Closely associated with the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a <b>laying</b> sequence, as well as the laying performance, was the parameter time interval between two laid eggs. The time interval between two laid eggs was significant shortened from the first to the third egg within one laying sequence and eventually reached for more than 24 h for most of the hens. The phenotypic and genetic correlation between the time interval and the laying performance was negative (r p =− 0. 46 and r g =− 0. 46). The heritability for the time interval was estimated at h²= 0. 17 which was similar to the heritability for number of eggs (h²= 0. 20). Slightly higher heritabilities were estimated for the indirect parameter of the time interval, the oviposition time of the third to the fifth egg in a laying sequence (h²= 0. 25, h²= 0. 34 and h²= 0. 29). Valuations in this range would be in regard of new performance testing parameter competitive to the parameter number of eggs and therefore, be tested in further investigations...|$|R

The average gain in egg production obtained by treating hens for broodi-ness ranged from 5 to 21 eggs/hen in different years. Hens from medium-bodied and large-bodied lines were either not treated for broodiness (con-trol), treated only from 4 to 8 weeks of production (partial broodiness; PB), or treated from 4 weeks of production throughout the entire laying period (full broodiness; FB). The medium-bodied lines originated from the RBC 1 line, while the large-bodied lines were from the RBC 2 line. Egg production of the PB hens from the medium-bodied lines did not differ (P>. 05) from the controls. On the other hand, egg production of PB hens from the large-bodied lines did not differ (P>. 05) from that of the FB hens. Treatment of broody hens had only minor effects on intensity <b>of</b> <b>lay.</b> The total days lost from broodiness decreased, and the effective <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laying</b> period in-creased with the FB treatment. The gains in egg production obtained by the FB treatment of the medium-bodied and large-bodied hens were 22 and 25 eggs/hen, respectively, when compared to the control groups.

40|$|Field {{work was}} carried out from August 1972 until August 1974 on an area of 119 ha. Of the Attenborough Gravel Pits in Nottinghamshire. A total of 135 {{territorial}} pairs were monitored with reference to size <b>of</b> territory, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> season, clutch size, egg size, hatching and fledging success and relationship with other waterfowl. Territory size varied from 0. 08 ha. To 1. 37 ha. {{with a mean of}} 0. 46 ha. It was not correlated with clutch size or bredding success. Both members of a pair defended the territory. A minimum of 19 pairs are believed to have remained on their territories for the whole of the study period. In both years the laying season lasted approximately 2. 5 months: peak laying season lasted approximately 2. 5 months: peak laying occurring from 24 April to 7 May. It is confirmed that Fulica atra in Europe is normally single brooded. No correlation was found between egg size and clutch size. In both years egg laid early in the breeding season were found to be significantly larger than all other eggs. The incubation period was 23 / 24 days. The mean clutch size of the 124 completed clutches was 6. 1 ± 0. 14 eggs. In Britain as a whole the overall mean clutch size was calculated to be 6. 0 ± 0. 08 eggs which is significantly smaller (d = 23. 006, P< 0. 001) than the mean clutch size (7. 9 ± 0. 03) of the coot in continental Europe. A hatching rate of 49. 3 % was recorded and of those chicks that hatched 41. 0 % fledged at approximately eight weeks. Breeding success averaged 20. 2 % with a mean of 1. 3 young fledged per breeding pair. Both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed and care for the young. Some young were still on territory, with their parents, at Il| weeks of age.

40|$|ABSTRACT Variations in light:dark {{ratios and}} timing {{schedules}} of 26 - and 28 -hr ahemeral cycles were examined for {{their effects on}} shell quality and egg weight. In two experiments utilizing 2578 White Leghorn Laying hens, 16 -week long ahemeral treatments were instituted abruptly late in the pullet laying season and again following a forced-molt production cycle. Ahemeral light-dark cycles <b>of</b> 28 -hr <b>length</b> resulted in significantly heavier shell and egg weights as compared to 26 -hr ahemeral cycles or the control 24 -hr cycle. Ahemeral 26 -hr cycles did not significantly increase egg weight compared to the 24 -hr controls but did increase shell weight. Varying total light in 28 -hr cycles from 20 to 10 hr with the light given in either one continuous period or interrupted by two intermediate dark periods and as either 18 or 16 hr of continuous light in the 26 -hr cycles {{did not result in}} significant differences in shell or egg weight compared to the other treatments of the same cycle <b>length.</b> Rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> was lower for the hens given only 10 hr of interrupted light in a 28 -hr cycle but was not otherwise affected by light treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT Data from inbred lines, one (D) {{selected}} for part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> {{and the other}} (C) un{{selected for}} any trait, were analyzed. After 19 generations of continuous full sib matings, the C line showed significant decreases in part record egg number, 32 -week egg weight, shell thickness, full record egg number and part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> but nonsignificant decreases in hatchability, full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> and laying house mortality. Age at first egg, Haugh unit and mature body weight showed significant increases in this line. The D line {{was similar to the}} C line in its response to the same intensity of inbreeding for all traits except full record egg number, part record rate, and fertility, each of which showed a significant decrease, and Haugh unit and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> which showed nonsignificant increases. Results indicated that the small advantages selection conferred on the inbred line in part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> (the selection criterion), full record egg number, and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> were ac-companied by undesirable changes in other traits, resulting in later sexual maturity, larger body weight, lower Haugh unit, fertility, and hatchability compared with the unselected line...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{factors associated}} with the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the post-fledging dependence period in 28 radio-tagged young Bonelli's Eagles Hieraaetus fasciatus monitored from 1998 to 2000. Under the assumptions of the Resource Competition Hypothesis (RCH), we predicted that young hatched in high-quality territories would have longer post-fledging dependence periods than young hatched in low-quality territories. As an alternative, we tested the Ontogenetic Switch Hypothesis (OSH), which predicts a better body condition in early dispersing young. For this purpose we measured body condition of young through levels of urea in the blood plasma. We found a weak positive effect of natal habitat quality on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the post-fledging dependence period, but no effect of body condition. Siblings were dependent on their parents for a similar number of days, suggesting that habitat and/or parent quality might influence the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the post-fledging dependence period. Young hatched in 1999 had shorter post-fledging dependence periods than young hatched in 1998 or 2000. The date of independence for young Bonelli's Eagles was correlated with the timing <b>of</b> breeding (<b>laying</b> date), {{but not with the}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the post-fledging dependence period. Neither brood size nor sex affected the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> this period. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
