25|$|Charles Hennebois {{touches on}} a {{wrenching}} aspect concerning the wounded. Some of them, {{instead of being}} transported to the hospital, were finished off {{on the field of}} battle: “Men wounded the day before were calling them from afar and asking to drink. The Germans finished them off by butting them with their rifles or bayoneting them, then despoiling them. I saw this from several metres away. A group of seven or eight men, felled by machine-gun crossfire, found itself at that point. Several were still alive, as they were begging the soldiers. They were finished off <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> said, shaken down and heaped up in a pile”. This claim is refuted in a German propaganda book about what happened in the camps published in 1918.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a little hard to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wayne Rainey {{has to win}} and Eddie Lawson has {{to finish}} outside the top 11 in order for Lawson to lose the {{championship}}. Reflecting on the mistake in Sweden that turned the championship around, Rainey says: “It’s really hard {{to tell you what}} I feel <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> feel like I’ve been beat up by everybody in the world, and I just feel so down and disappointed in myself.

2500|$|DeVille quit {{high school}} and began frequenting New York's Lower East Side and West Village. [...] "It seemed <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> hung out and hung out. I always wanted to play music but nobody really had it {{together}} then. They had psychedelic bands but that wasn't my thing." [...] In this period, DeVille's interests ran to blues guitarists Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, and especially John Hammond. [...] "I think I owe a lot about my look, my image on stage, and my vocal riffs to John Hammond. A lot of my musical stance is from John," [...] Deville said. He credited Hammond's 1965 album So Many Roads with [...] "changing my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2015, T.I. {{received}} backlash when he {{was speaking}} on 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: [...] "Not to be sexist but, I can’t vote for {{the leader of the}} free world to be a woman. Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president? It’s kinda <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> know that women make rash decisions emotionally – they make very permanent, cemented decisions – and then later, it’s kind of like it didn’t happen, or they didn’t mean for it to happen.

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E

5000|$|On October 4, 2011, Varner {{appeared}} on BET's 106 & Park to premier the video for [...] "Only Wanna Give It to You". While {{she was there}} she was asked how the J. Cole collaboration came to be, she explained: [...] "We actually met in college. He went to St. John's {{and we had a}} mutual friend at my school and like two years later I saw him in the Sony building when <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> got signed and I bumped into him <b>I</b> was <b>like</b> 'Yo what's up what are you doing here?' and he's <b>like</b> 'Yo <b>I</b> <b>just</b> signed with Roc Nation' and I"m <b>like</b> 'Yo <b>I</b> <b>just</b> signed with J.

5000|$|Songwriter {{and primary}} {{recording}} artist Katie Crutchfield wrote Cerulean Salt {{over the course}} of a year, stating: [...] "For me, I’ve always been, <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> can <b>just</b> spit out a bunch of songs really quickly.

5000|$|On {{the release}} of Ultraviolence, she reaffirmed her earlier {{reluctance}} to make another album, saying [...] "I mean, I still feel that way, but with this album <b>I</b> felt less <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had to chronicle my journeys and more <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could <b>just</b> recount snippets in my recent past that felt exhilarating to me".|$|R
6000|$|Take an illustration. Your {{house has}} been broken into and robbed, and you appeal to the {{policeman}} who was on duty that night. [...] "Well, Mum, I did see a chap getting out over your garden-wall: but I was a good bit off, so I didn't chase him, <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> cut down the short way to the Chequers, and who should I meet but Bill Sykes, coming full split round the corner. So I just ups and says 'My lad, you're wanted.' That's all I says. And he says 'I'll go along quiet, Bobby,' he says, 'without the darbies,' he says." [...] There's your Arithmetical policeman. Now try the other method. [...] "I seed somebody a running, but he was well gone or ever I got nigh the place. So I just took a look round in the garden. And I noticed the foot-marks, where the chap had come right across your flower-beds. They was good big foot-marks sure-ly. And I noticed as the left foot went down at the heel, ever so much deeper than the other. And I says to myself 'The chap's been a big hulking chap: and he goes lame on his left foot.' And I rubs {{my hand on the}} wall where he got over, and there was soot on it, and no mistake. So I says to myself 'Now where can I light on a big man, in the chimbley-sweep line, what's lame of one foot?' And I flashes up permiscuous: and I says 'It's Bill Sykes!' says I." [...] There is your Algebraical policeman--a higher intellectual type, to my thinking, than the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Marilla, it {{was beyond}} description. I was so excited I couldn't even talk, so you may {{know what it was}} <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> sat in enraptured silence. Madame Selitsky was {{perfectly}} beautiful, and wore white satin and diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else. Oh, I can't tell you how I felt. But {{it seemed to me that}} it could never be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to the stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears. I was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn't see how I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night. Diana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn't born for city life and that I was glad of it. It's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while; but as a regular thing I'd rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I don't think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn't trying to be funny. But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally." ...|$|E
