500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album. [...] Said Bunn, [...] "Our first record had a lot of darker songs such as 'Razor' and 'Greed'. [...] Even though we liked some of that, we truly realized we're a bunch of happy guys! [...] We like to have fun onstage and in our lives, so we didn't want this album to be as dark as the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if we learn from our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it will make us a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy</b> is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E
2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy</b> between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy</b> are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1984 apostolic exhortation titled Reconciliatio et paenitentia (Latin for Reconciliation and Penance), Pope John Paul II {{used this}} parable {{to explain the}} process of {{conversion}} and reconciliation. Emphasizing that God the Father is [...] "rich in mercy" [...] and always ready to forgive, he stated that reconciliation is a gift on his part. He stated that for the Church her [...] "mission of reconciliation is the initiative, full of compassionate <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy,</b> of that God who is love."

The forgetting of solidarity [...] "imposed by our common origin {{and by the}} equality of rational nature in all men" [...] was called [...] "pernicious error".

2500|$|According to him, [...] "Muhammad", {{which means}} [...] "the most praised one", {{refers to the}} glorious destiny, majesty {{and power of the}} prophet, who adopted the name from about the time of the Hegira; but [...] "Ahmad", an Arabic elative form, which means [...] "highly praised" [...] and also [...] "comforter", stands for the beauty of his sermons, for the qualities of gentleness, humility, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy</b> {{displayed}} by Muhammad, and for the peace that he was destined to establish in the world through his teachings. According to Ahmad, these names thus refer to two aspects or phases of Islam, and in later times it was the latter aspect that commanded greater attention.|$|E

2500|$|Following the German/Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland, the Pope's first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and rejected antisemitism, quoting scripture singling out the [...] "principle of equality"—with specific reference to Jews: [...] "there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision" [...] and direct {{affirmation of the}} Jewish Revelation on Sinai. The forgetting of solidarity [...] "imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men" [...] was called [...] "pernicious error".

2500|$|For Al-Albani, misyar {{marriage}} {{may even}} be considered as illicit, because it runs counter to the objectives {{and the spirit of}} marriage in Islam, as described in the Quran: [...] "And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy</b> between your (hearts)…" [...] Al-Albani also underlines the social problems which result from the [...] "misyar" [...] marriage, particularly in the event that children are born from this union. The children raised by their mother in a home from which the father is always absent, without reason, may suffer difficulties. The situation becomes even worse if the wife is abandoned or repudiated by her husband [...] "misyar", with no means of subsistence, as usually happens.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was typical}} of the Hines to ask if there were any Christians in the villages they visited. In one case, they found out that the only Christians that their host knew about were a man named Dmitri and his wife Lyudmila. Dmitri's wife knew how to read -- evidently a fairly rare thing at that time and in that place. She taught herself how to read because a Russian soldier had left a Bible behind several years earlier, and she started slowly {{learning}} by reading that Bible. When the Hines arrived in the village and approached Dmitri's house, they heard a strange and wonderful sound: Dmitri's wife was reading from the gospel of John about the crucifixion of Christ to a houseful of guests, and those visitors were in the very act of repenting. In Ukraine (as I know first hand!), this act of repenting is done very much out loud. So the Hines heard people calling out to God, saying how unbelievable it was that Christ would die for their own sins, and praising Him for His <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>mercy.</b> They just couldn't barge in and disrupt this obvious work of the Holy Spirit, so they stayed outside and listened. Stuart wrote down the phrases he heard the Repenters use, and (even though this was all in Russian), it became the third verse that we know today: [...] "And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in." ...|$|E
