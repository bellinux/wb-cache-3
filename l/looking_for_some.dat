5|$|Prior to the draft, the Texas Rangers {{held the}} second lowest {{attendance}} in the American League, ahead {{of only the}} Cleveland Indians despite having Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager at one point. They had moved from Washington, D.C., two years prior, and owner Bob Short expanded Arlington Stadium an extra 20,000 seats. Short was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> sort of way to boost attendance, and found it using fellow Texas native Clyde. When Clyde agreed to sign his rookie contract, {{part of the deal}} was to make his first two professional starts with the Rangers at their home field before heading to the minors to develop.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E

25|$|The Alamodome's {{ability to}} easily {{accommodate}} basketball made it attractive to then-Spurs owner Red McCombs, {{who had been}} <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time for a larger arena to replace their longtime home, HemisFair Arena. The Spurs moved to the Alamodome after the 1992–93 NBA season. They played nine seasons in the Alamodome, including their first NBA championship season, which was played against the New York Knicks in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Up to 200 {{missiles}} were launched against Iran between 1987 and 1988, killing some 2,000 people. Teheran, Qom and Isfahan became the usual targets. Their poor accuracy, while mostly ineffective {{to conduct a}} major strategic campaign, made of them basically weapons of terror, forcing thousands of refugees out of the main Iranian cities. This exchange of ballistic missiles was indeed known as 'the war of the cities'. The full-scale campaign lasted from 29 February 1988 until April 20, when a truce was agreed by both sides. Iraq, which had been <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> kind of compromise gesture from Iran, is largely viewed as the 'winner' by some authors.|$|E

Along with Rashida Jones, she visited college campuses in Missouri {{to discuss the}} candidates and encourage voter registration.

"The Franciscan Spanish {{fathers are}} {{explaining}} that the King of the Ambassador [...] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow {{the will of the}} church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high eclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, many people have been doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are wondering if they are not <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> other benefit."

500|$|In 1250, {{following}} Haraldr Guðrøðarson's summons to Norway, the Chronicle of Mann {{records that}} Magnús and Eóghan arrived on Mann {{with a force}} of Norwegians. The exact intentions of the invaders are unknown; {{it is possible that}} they may have intended to install Magnús as king. At the very least, Eóghan was likely <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> form of compensation for his dispossession from his mainland Scottish lordship. The chronicle states that the invaders made landfall at Ronaldsway, and entered into negotiations with the Manx people; although, when it was learned that Eóghan styled himself [...] "King of the Isles", the Manxmen took offence and broke off all dialogue.|$|E
500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' {{takes place in a}} world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are {{trying to find a way}} to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low marks, warning that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from GamePro, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that [...] "if you're <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> classic shooter action on your new GBA, Iridion 3D will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, the chronicle records that Magnús Óláfsson (died 1265)yet another son of Óláfrand Eóghan arrived on Mann {{with a force}} of Norwegians. The exact {{intentions}} of the invaders are unknown for certain. It is possible {{that they may have}} intended to install Magnús as king. At the very least, Eóghan was likely <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> form of compensation, as he had previously been forcefully dispossessed of his mainland Scottish lordship by Alexander II, King of Scots (died 1249) for his refusal to renounce his allegiance to Hákon. The chronicle states that the invaders made landfall at Ronaldsway, and entered into negotiations with the Manx people; although, when it was learned that Eóghan styled himself [...] "King of the Isles" [...] the Manxmen took offence and broke off all dialogue. The chronicle describes how Eóghan had his men form-up on St Michael's Isle, an island that was attached to Mann by a tidal causeway, and that the Manxmen formed-up on the mainland, on the beach opposite the island. When the tide began to recede, the chronicle states that Eóghan and those men closest to him boarded their ships, although much of his force remained stationed on the island. As evening drew near, the chronicle records that an accomplice of Ívarr led an attack upon the island and routed Eóghan's forces there. The next day, the chronicle states that the invading forces left the shores of Mann.|$|E

500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the kind who love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that same}} month, on October 24, 1874, the Arizona Miner reported, [...] "Al Zieber, Sergeant Stauffer and a mixed command {{of white and}} red {{soldiers}} are {{in the hills of}} Verde <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> erring Apaches, whom they will be apt to find." [...] Three days later, Sieber and Sgt. Rudolph Stauffer found the Apaches that had escaped the reservation at Cave Creek and fought them.|$|E

The album {{includes}} some amazing co-writes with contributors like Ben Glover (Brandon Heath, Lee Brice) and Seth Mosley (Newsboys)." [...] Davies finished by saying that [...] "This album from Disciple is a very admirable album, there are some great songs on here that have such energy to them that I'm sure all hard rock fans will appreciate. Overall this is a very solid and exciting release from Disciple." ...|$|E

He briefly considers killing Michael after discovering it was Michael who burned him, but instead grudgingly continues {{to work with the}} team, as he and Michael slowly reconcile.

2500|$|When <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> proof, most of {{the rules}} offer more or less direct recipes of how to do this. The rule of cut is different: it states that, when a formula [...] can be {{concluded}} and this formula may {{also serve as a}} premise for concluding other statements, then the formula [...] can be [...] "cut out" [...] and the respective derivations are joined. When constructing a proof bottom-up, this creates the problem of guessing [...] (since it does not appear at all below). The cut-elimination theorem is thus crucial to the applications of sequent calculus in automated deduction: it states that all uses of the cut rule can be eliminated from a proof, implying that any provable sequent can be given a cut-free proof.|$|E
