40|$|After {{coronary}} occlusion, myocardium originally {{supplied by}} the occluded vessel ultimately separates into infarct and surviving muscle. To clarify this process, evolution of collateral blood flow to infarct and to surviving myocardium was retrospectively analyzed after permanent left anterior descending occlusion in 24 closed chest dogs. Microspheres were injected before occlusion and 5 and 20 minutes and 4 hours after occlusion. Ten minutes after occlusion, dogs received either verapamil, 0. 4 mg/kg, followed by 0. 6 mg/kg per hour for 6 hours (n = 10) or equivalent saline solution (n = 14). These dogs were sacrificed 3 days later, {{the distribution of the}} occluded artery was defined by dye perfusion and infarcted myocardium was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining of heart slices. Surviving muscle within the distribution of the occluded artery was divided into medial regions adjacent to the infarct (medial adjacent) and remote from the infarct (medial <b>remote)</b> and <b>lateral</b> regions adjacent to infarct (<b>lateral</b> adjacent) and <b>remote</b> from the infarct (<b>lateral</b> <b>remote).</b> In both control and verapamil groups, collateral flows in all regions increased significantly by 140 to 400 % over 4 hours. However, the relative magnitude of collateral flow to different regions showed a consistent order: infarct < medial adjacent < medial <b>remote</b> < <b>lateral</b> <b>remote.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} regionally matched flows or size of infarction between control and verapamil-treated groups. Collateral perfusion begins to show distinctive patterns of change in infarct and surviving muscle very soon after coronary occlusion. Collateral flow within subdivisions of the occluded coronary artery bed increases as distance from the infarct increases, with lateral segments having higher flows than medial segments. This relation persists during the first 4 hours after occlusion. In this study, verapamil neither increased collateral flow to the occluded bed nor altered minimal flow requirements for myocardial survival...|$|R

The overview begins with the pioneering work of Fujishima and his co-workers involving the remote bleaching of methylene blue by UV-irradiation of titania in the gas phase. The further research of these workers conducted on the remote photocatalytic destruction of various polymers and dyes is then discussed briefly. The notable work of Paz and his co-workers on the <b>lateral,</b> but not <b>remote,</b> oxidation of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) by photoeteched titania films is then examined.

40|$|Aims: Alcohol septal {{ablation}} (ASA) {{has been}} successful in the treatment of symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of ethanol-induced myocardial infarcts on regional myocardial function using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue tagging and 3 -dimensional (3 D) strain analysis. Methods and results: In nine patients (age 52 ± 15 years) who underwent ASA, CMR was performed prior to and 6 months after the procedure. Regional myocardial mass was evaluated using cine imaging. Myocardial tagging was used to calculate systolic 3 D myocardial strain values. These strain values were used to calculate the shortening index (SI), a robust parameter for myocardial contraction. Maximum end-systolic (ES) SI and systolic SI rate were quantified in three circumferential segments: septum, adjacent, and <b>remote</b> (<b>lateral)</b> myocardium. Compared with baseline, septal and non-septal mass decreased at follow-up (from 72 ± 27 to 59 ± 21 g; P= 0. 008 and from 131 ± 34 to 109 ± 30 g; P= 0. 008, respectively). In the septum, maximum ES SI and SI rate remained unchanged after ASA. In adjacent myocardium, ES SI remained unchanged, whereas SI rate improved (from - 56. 5 ± 21. 1 to - 70. 0 ± 16. 7 %/s; P= 0. 02). Both ES SI and SI rate improved significantly in remote myocardium (from - 16. 9 ± 2. 8 to - 18. 8 ± 3. 2 %; P= 0. 02 and from - 70. 3 ± 9. 2 to - 86. 1 ± 15. 0 %/s; P= 0. 01, respectively). Conclusion: Reduction of left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction in symptomatic HOCM is associated with a significant reduction in myocardial mass and improvement of intramural systolic function in the <b>lateral</b> (<b>remote)</b> wall, indicating reversed LV remodelling. © The European Society of Cardiology 2006.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the use of amino acids and codons in {{influenza}} viruses A and B and in their common hosts, to highlight any relevant difference. METHODS: The frequency of the 20 amino acids and of the 61 codons was studied in influenza viruses A, B, and in man, pig, and chicken. The correlation in amino acid and codon use among these hosts was calculated. RESULTS: The correlation between the frequency of the 20 amino acids and the molecular weight was also calculated and it was very similar in all studied hosts, ranging from 0. 506 to 0. 595. The correlation of codon frequency among these organisms was highest between man and chicken (r= 0. 974), and lowest between pig and virus B (r= 0. 147).

40|$|International audienceA {{wide variety}} of remote sensing and {{ground-based}} (proximal sensing) methods {{have been developed to}} describe soil physical properties and their <b>lateral</b> variations. <b>Remote</b> sensing enables the estimation of soil properties over large areas, but the information is often limited to the soil surface. Ground-based methods enable the derivation of soil properties for the whole soil column thickness, although these methods cannot be conducted over large areas. The aim of the present study is to contribute to the assessment of the efficacy of airborne thermal prospection over bare soils in soil mapping. This study focuses on a comparison between this technique, which can investigate over the whole soil column thickness after a sufficiently long transient heat exchange period, and pedological and electrical resistivity data that were recorded for three different depths of investigation. The study area is located in the Beauce region, where the soils (haplic Calcisol or calcaric Cambisol) consist of a loamy–clay layer that is 0. 3 m– 1. 4 m thick and overlies Tertiary Beauce limestone. Thermal measurements were recorded by ARIES radiometer in December after six days of heat loss from the ground. The investigation depth could thus be considered to be larger than the thickness of the ploughed layer. Comparisons using statistical analyses between the thermal measurements, electrical resistivity, and pedological data demonstrated that: (i) the spatial organization of the thermal inertia map is similar to the spatial organization of the 0 -m to 1. 7 -m resistivity map; and (ii) the thermal apparent inertia values are significantly different between the haplic Calcisols and the calcaric Cambisols and can thus be mapped with a high spatial resolution over large areas. The applicability of thermal prospecting in soil mapping opens up many possibilities considering the present advances in light-infrared radiometers. Beside agronomical concerns, this methodology will also facilitate progress in engineering applications, including the cross estimation of electrical and thermal properties...|$|R

In this paper we present {{a new approach to}} modeling event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme, in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among well-defined neuronal subpopulations.

40|$|Background: Since first {{reported}} in 1996, endoscopic {{minimally invasive surgery}} of the cervical region {{has been shown to}} be safe and effective in the treatment of benign thyroid and parathyroid disease. The endoscopic transaxillary technique uses a <b>remote</b> <b>lateral</b> approach to the thyroid gland. Because of the perceived difficulty in accessing the contralateral anatomy of the thyroid gland, this technique has typically been reserved for patients with unilateral disease. Objectives: The present study examines the safety and feasibility of the transaxillary technique in dissecting and assessment of both thyroid lobes in performing near total thyroidectomy. Methods: Prior to this study we successfully performed endoscopic transaxillary thyroid lobectomy in 32 patients between August 2003 and August 2005. Technical feasibility in performing total thyroidectomy using this approach was accomplished first utilizing a porcine model followed by three human cadaver models prior to proceeding to human surgery. After IRB approval three female patients with histories of enlarging multinodular goiter were selected to undergo endoscopic near total thyroidectomy. Results: The average operative time for all models was 142 minutes (range 57 – 327 min). The three patients in this study had clinically enlarging multinodular goiters with an average size of 4 cm. The contralateral recurrent laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands were identified in all cases. There was no post-operative bleeding, hoarseness or subcutaneous emphysema. Conclusion: Endoscopic transaxillary near total thyroidectomy is feasible and can be performed safely in human patients with bilateral thyroid disease...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether inferior ST segment depression during early stages of acute transmural anterior myocardial infarction identifies patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and additional inferior ischemia. Coronary and left ventricular angiography were performed within 3. 4 months in 33 patients with acute transmural anterior infarction. Initial electrocardiograms, 2 to 5 hours after onset of chest pain, revealed significant ST segment depression (≥ 0. 1 mV) {{in at least two}} of leads II, III and aVF in 15 patients (45 %) (group B); in 18 patients (group A) this finding was absent. Compared with group A, patients in group B had greater anterior ST elevation (1. 2 versus 0. 7 mV, p < 0. 025); higher serum peak creatine kinase (2, 475 versus 1, 147 IU/liter, p < 0. 005); higher KUlip scores (2. 1 versus 1. 3, p < 0. 001); more in-hospital complications (60 versus 17 %, p < 0. 05); lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (34 versus 55 %, p < 0. 001); more frequent regional left ventricular dysfunction in anterolateral (91 versus 44 %, p < 0. 05), posterolateral (36 versus 0 %, p < 0. 05) and inferior (100 versus 6 %, p < 0. 005) regions; greater wall motion abnormality scores (10. 0 versus 5. 5, p < 0. 005); higher frequency of concomitant left circumflex or right coronary artery disease, or both (80 versus 28 %, p < 0. 01); more frequent postinfarction angina (100 versus 39 %, p < 0. 001) and lower New York Heart Association functional classification scores (1. 7 versus 2. 4, p < 0. 05) at 6 month follow-up. The time course of inferior ST depression differed from that of anterior ST elevation. Thus, inferior ST depression was maximal in the first 48 hours and decreased (p < 0. 05) thereafter. In contrast, ST elevation in leads V 1 to V 6 and I appeared to decrease (p = NS) between days 4 and 7. However, inferior ST depression “mirrored” ST elevation in lead aVL, which also decreased (p < 0. 05) after 48 hours. Thus, inferior ST depression during anterior infarction is associated with more expensive infarction, greater morbidity and higher frequency of multivessel coronary disease. Such inferior ST depression might reflect not only “reciprocal change,” but also ischemia in adjacent <b>lateral</b> and <b>remote</b> inferior regions...|$|R

Here we investigated the molecular signals of the ischemia non-affected <b>remote</b> <b>lateral</b> and posterior regions and present gene expression profiles of the entire left ventricle by using our novel and straightforward method of 2 D and 3 D image reconstruction. Five or 24 h after repetitive 10 min ischemia/reperfusion without subsequent infarction, pig hearts were explanted and myocardial samples from 52 equally distributed locations of the left ventricle were collected. Expressional changes of seven genes of interest (HIF- 1 α; caspase- 3, transcription factor GATA 4; myocyte enhancer factor 2 C /MEF 2 c/; hexokinase 2 /HK 2 /; clusterin /CLU/ and excision repair cross-complementation group 4 /ERCC 4 /) were measured by qPCR. 2 D and 3 D gene expression maps were constructed by projecting the fold changes on the NOGA anatomical mapping coordinates. Caspase- 3, GATA 4, HK 2, CLU, and ERCC 4 were up-regulated region-specifically in the ischemic zone at 5 h post ischemia/reperfusion injury. Overexpression of GATA 4, clusterin and ERCC 4 persisted after 24 h. HK 2 showed strong up-regulation in the ischemic zone and down-regulation in remote areas at 5 h, and was severely reduced in all heart regions at 24 h. These results indicate a quick onset of regulation of apoptosis-related genes, which is partially reversed in the late phase of ischemia/reperfusion cardioprotection, and highlight variations between ischemic and unaffected myocardium over time.

Thirty HCM patients (64. 4 ± 10. 5 years, 14 male, 12 hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy [HNCM], 16 HOCM, and 2 dilated phase of HCM) underwent 18 F-FDG-PET/CT. 18 F-FDG uptake was semi-quantitatively evaluated using an uptake score in each 17 segment and the entire LV or regional standardized uptake value (SUV). 18 F-FDG uptake was observed mostly in a hypertrophied myocardium in HNCM patients, whereas 18 F-FDG was extensively accumulated beyond the hypertrophied myocardium in HOCM patients. There was a positive correlation between the summed uptake score of 18 F-FDG and high-sensitive troponin T level in HNCM patients (r = 0. 603, p = 0. 049), whereas the score was positively correlated with brain natriuretic peptide level (r = 0. 614, p = 0. 011) in HOCM patients. In 10 patients who received ASA, the maximum SUV of the entire LV was significantly reduced from 5. 6 ± 2. 6 to 3. 2 ± 2. 1 (p = 0. 040) after ASA. Reduction of that maximum SUV was particularly significant in the lateral region (from 5. 5 ± 2. 6 to 2. 9 ± 2. 2, p = 0. 024) but not significant in the anteroseptal region (from 4. 5 ± 2. 6 to 2. 9 ± 1. 6, p = 0. 12).

In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the face-selective N 170, could be explained by category-specific differences in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework...|$|R
