50|$|Unless the ladle {{is to be}} {{used with}} alloys that have very low {{temperature}} melting point, the ladle is also fitted with a refractory lining. It is the refractory lining that stops the steel vessel from suffering damage when the ladle is used to transport metals with high melting temperatures that, if the molten metal came in direct contact with the <b>ladle</b> <b>shell,</b> would rapidly melt through the shell. Refractory lining materials come in many forms and the right choice very much depends on each foundry's working practices. Traditionally ladles used to be lined using pre-cast firebricks however refractory concretes have tended to supersede these in many countries.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{operational}} measurement, of which content {{was to determine}} ladle thermal profile, there were analysed causes of possible damage of lining in steel ladles by steel breakout through the <b>ladle</b> <b>shell.</b> There exists connection between thermal state of ladle lining during the operation and its lifetime. There were reached {{to the conclusion that}} the cause of failure in the lining of ladle is except for high temperature of bath, also wide interval of temperature change during the tap operation, in consequence with possible insufficient pre-heating of ladle, discontinuous operation of aggregate and damage of insulating lining layer, respectively deformation of ladles shell.

40|$|In this study, it {{was shown}} that {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} continuously cast steel billets, similar to those which can be achieved by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of the liquid pool during solidification, can be obtained if casting superheats can be consistently controlled at low levels. A lack of casting temperature control is not only detrimental {{to the quality of the}} cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the ladle lining is one of the major contributors to the variability in casting temperature. It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory ladle lining, by way of incorporating an insulating refractory tile between the <b>ladle</b> <b>shell</b> and the safety lining and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} mounds at Pineland, which were shell middens, the Smith Mound is a sand mound with thin layers of shell, {{and was used}} for burials. The Smith Mound was {{originally}} about 300 ft long and 30 ft high. (Cushing gave dimensions for this mound of 375 ft long, 150 ft wide and 58 ft high.) It {{was surrounded by a}} pond fed by a canal which branched from the Pine Island Canal. A path wound around the mound to the summit, which was narrow but flat. Cushing observed potsherds, broken <b>shell</b> <b>ladles,</b> and human bones on the mound. The Smith Mound was constructed around 1000 years ago. Part of the mound was destroyed more than a century ago, and the adjacent pond and canal filled in. Half of the mound and the pond were preserved by its owner, Captain Smith.|$|R
50|$|Lothal {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} centres of production for shell-working, owing to the abundance of chank shell of high quality found in the Gulf of Kutch and near the Kathiawar coast Gamesmen, beads, unguent vessels, chank <b>shells,</b> <b>ladles</b> and inlays were made for export and local consumption. Components of stringed musical instruments like the plectrum and the bridge were made of shell. An ivory workshop was operated under strict official supervision, and the domestication of elephants has been suggested. An ivory seal, and sawn pieces for boxes, combs, rods, inlays and ear-studs were found during excavations. Lothal produced a large quantity of gold ornamentsâ€”the most attractive item being microbeads of gold in five strands in necklaces, unique for being less than 0.25 millimetres (0.010 inches) in diameter. Cylindrical, globular and jasper beads of gold with edges at right angles resemble modern pendants used by women in Gujarat in plaits of hair. A large disc with holes recovered from a sacrificial altar is compared to the rukma worn by Vedic priests. Studs, cogwheel and heart-shaped ornaments of fainence and steatite were popular in Lothal. A ring of thin copper wire turned into double spirals resembles the gold-wire rings used by modern Hindus for weddings.|$|R
