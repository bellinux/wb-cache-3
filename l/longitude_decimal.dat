25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN {{maritime}} navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and <b>longitude</b> in degrees, <b>decimal</b> degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|R

40|$|This dataset {{consists}} of measurements and data products {{derived from a}} shipboard stereo video system, two styles of drifting wave buoys (SWIFT and Waverider), and the standard measurements made from the R/V Thomas G. Thompson. All data are stored as. mat files to be read into Matlab. The data from each platform are described below: STEREO VIDEO The stereo video data is found in two compressed directories: StereoXYZData_FiveMin and StereoXYZData_FullCapture. Each directory is broken down by date and then further by time (in UTC). These correspond to the start time of the stereo video segment. The duration of the full videos ranged from 20 to 60 minutes. In the StereoXYZData_FullCapture directory, the 10 best full video segments are processed. In StereoXYZData_FiveMin, the first five minutes from 52 video segments of intermediate or better data were processed. Within each video, the main data {{is found in the}} subdirectory XYZResults. The data are stored as one-minute bursts. Files named ZGrid_ 01. mat and XYGrid_ 01. mat correspond to the first minute, ZGrid_ 02. mat and XYGrid_ 02. mat to the second, etc. The XYGrid files give the x (xgrid, in meters) and y (ygrid, in meters) points of the gridded stereo data. For all the data given here, x and y range from - 20 to + 20 meters, with a resolution of 0. 25 meters (size 161 x 161). The +x coordinate is the downwind direction. The ZGrid files give the three-dimensional gridded elevation (zgrid, in meters) and radiance (imgrid, arbitrary units) data products. When the camera frame rate was set at 5 Hz (prior to January 1), the resulting arrays are size 161 x 161 x 300. When the frame rate was 7. 5 Hz, the arrays are 161 x 161 x 450. The other subdirectories give plots and information related to the processing of the raw stereo data into the gridded data products. DisparityPlots shows the rectified stereo images and their disparity image. XYZPlots shows the resulting elevation and radiance products. IGMVectors gives the time series of ship motion from the Novatel SPAN-IGM system, which were used to project the data into real-world coordinates. And StereoOptions. mat saves the options used in Matlab’s disparity function to process the stereo imagery. SWIFT The surface wave instrument float with tracking (SWIFT) buoy is described in Thomson (2012). All SWIFT data are found in a single file, SWIFTdata_TGT 2015. mat. This file contains a single Matlab structure array (1 x 2522), named smallSWIFT. Each member of the struct array is derived from a burst of 512 seconds.

A new function, get_station_list() allows for fetching latest station list from the FTP server and querying by the user for a specified station or location. New data layers are provided through a separate package, GSODRdata, which provide climate data formatted for use with GSODR. CHELSA (climatic surfaces at 1 km resolution), [URL] MODCF - Remotely sensed high-resolution global cloud dynamics for predicting ecosystem and biodiversity distributions ([URL] ESACCI - ESA's CCI-LC snow cover probability ([URL] and CRU CL 2. 0 (climatic surfaces at 10 minute resolution) ([URL] Improved file handling for individual station downloads Missing values are handled as NA not - 9999 Change from GPL >= 3 to MIT licence to bring into line with ropensci packages Now included in ropensci, ropensci/GSODR Minor changes get_GSOD() function optimised for speed as best possible after FTPing files from NCDC server All files are downloaded from server and then locally processed, previously these were sequentially downloaded by year and then processed A progress bar is now shown when processing files locally after downloading Reduced package dependencies The get_GSOD() function now checks stations to see if the years being queried are provided and returns a message alerting user if the station and years requested are not available When stations are specified for retrieval using the station = "" parameter, the get_GSOD() function now checks to see if the file exists on the server, if it does not, a message is returned and all other stations that have files are processed and returned in output Documentation has been improved throughout package Better testing of internal functions Bug Fixes Fixed: Remove redundant code in get_GSOD() function Fixed: The stations data frame distributed with the package now include stations that are located above 60 latitude and below - 60 latitude Deprecated and defunct Missing values are reported as NA for use in R, not - 9999 as previously The path parameter is now instead called dsn to be more inline with other tools like readOGR() and writeOGR() Shapefile file out is no longer supported. Use GeoPackage (GPKG) instead The option to remove stations with too many missing days is now optional, it now defaults to including all stations, the user must specify how many missing stations to check for an exclude. The max_missing parameter is now user set, defaults to no check, return all stations regardless of missing day...|$|R
