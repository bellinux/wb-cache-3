2500|$|During {{a debate}} with Farrell Till, Hovind said that Donald Johanson had {{uncovered}} the leg bones of Lucy {{at a different}} site over a mile away from the reported site, in a deeper stratum, quipping, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee." [...] This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson. After Hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false, he agreed to stop using the claim. When he repeated the claim in 1995, he once more agreed he was in error.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the semi-final, {{the voting}} method {{used during the}} show was commented upon, with the {{non-qualifying}} artists finding the results [...] "weird and not right". The voting method saw the televotes of 10 regions of Lithuania being converted into points, 1 point for the least favoured and 12 for the most preferred. Alanas, who failed to qualify to the final, said that she found the voting [...] "very bizarre", {{and that she would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many people voted for her. Augustė, who also failed to qualify, called it [...] "nonsense", commentating on the difference in the amount of votes cast in Vilnius in comparison to smaller towns in Lithuania: [...] "I don't understand how can we compare points of Vilnius and of some small city in Lithuania. In Vilnius we need thousands of votes to get 12 points. Meanwhile in a small city a hundred votes can be enough".|$|E

He must be either indifferent or unwilling. Had he wished ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time; {{he would have done}} what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting.|$|R
5000|$|Fatima is the portly, expert cook in Skimo. She {{makes all}} dishes and meals and helps {{in a lot}} of things. She is a very dreamy person who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much she is needed. She {{sometimes}} experiments by combining two different recipes, making the dishes that Skimo is noted for. When the order is done she shouts very loud [...] "Sale un (order) para la mesa (number of the table)" [...] which is Spanish for [...] "Ready some... (order)... for the table number...(number of the table)" [...] until the grade of a deafening.|$|R

2500|$|Darwin's brother Erasmus {{reported}} on 23 November that Henry Holland {{was reading the}} book and in [...] "a dreadful state of indecision", sure that explaining the eye would be [...] "utterly impossible", but after reading it [...] "he hummed & hawed & perhaps it was partly conceivable". Erasmus himself thought it [...] "the most interesting book I ever read", and sent a copy to his old flame Miss Harriet Martineau who, at 58, was still reviewing {{from her home in}} the Lake District. [...] Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised [...] "the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by wh. it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentious knowledge. I shd. much <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road." ...|$|E

I should much <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, [...] "In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished." [...] She wrote to her fellow Malthusian (and atheist) George Holyoake enthusing, [...] "What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath." [...] To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of Hensleigh Wedgwood) she wrote, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must say}} good-bye now, Ronald, {{and again in}} the morning. Why I ask you is because I want to tell my father. You don't mind that, do you?

5000|$|The truth, in George's view, is {{not that}} Elaine thanked the wrong person, but that Julie {{accepted}} the thanks.

[...] Julie understands perfectly well, and says, [...] "George, all I did was hand someone a bag." [...] Semi-humiliated, George vows never to buy Elaine lunch again.|$|R
40|$|BOUNDPACK is {{a package}} for {{computing}} solutions of boundary value problems (BVP). At this moment BOUNDPACK contains routines to compute solutions of two-point linear BVP for non-stiff problems, which {{are described in}} the first chapter. The routines are designed for either general boundary con-ditions (BC),(the routines DHUTSG and SMUTSG for respectively double preci-sion and single precision computation), separated BC, (the routines Dl 4 UTSS and SMUTSS) or partially separated BC, (the routines DMUTSP and SMUTSP). The manual is designed {{in such a way}} that both the user who only <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> call the routines and the user who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about the method should find his way through the following decription. The first user may restrict himself to § 1 and § 5 and also might consult 9 4 if more in-formmation is needed. The present routines not only try to compute the desired solution accurate-ly, but also aim at a reliable diagnosis when the computation encounters difficulties. In any case (also if no problems are reported) the routines deliver useful stability constants of the problem. It is our intension to extend BOUNDPACK in the near future with routines for other specific cases. Comments and reports about the present routines are very much welcomed...|$|R

[...] "I thought, perhaps, that you would <b>like</b> people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> you had sacrificed yourself {{to put an end to}} the curse, and how cleverly you had managed to deceive every one. People would never believe us if we were to tell them. They would say either that you did not know what you were talking about, or that it was empty boasting on your part." ...|$|R
