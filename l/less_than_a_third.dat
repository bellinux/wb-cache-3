40|$|An {{examination}} of light scattering and emissions from a fluorescent dye confined within small hollow core quartz fibers has revealed several interesting phenomena. First, backscattered fluorescent emissions increased as the fiber's inner diameter decreased below 23 microns.

The interference induced oscillations produced large intensity changes in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> degree. <b>Third,</b> fiber immersion in an index-matched fluid removed the interference oscillations, and fourth, the fiber immersion also decreased the backscattered fluorescent emissions for the same fiber. These research results can be used to optimize the design of fluorescence measuring devices used in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). A CZE device measures the fluorescence spectrum from biological material within small hollow core fibers. The small amount of fluorescent material makes it desirable to find an optimum viewing angle to maximize signal and avoid spurious results from selective wavelength enhancement and intensity variations in angular scattering caused by the fiber...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control.

In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of that figure.

To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of the Royal Family, Naples descended into anarchy and news reached Palermo in January that the French had entered the city under General Championnet and proclaimed the Parthenopaean Republic. Nelson was promoted to Rear Admiral of the Red on 14 February 1799, and was occupied for several months in blockading Naples, while a popular counter-revolutionary force under Cardinal Ruffo known as the Sanfedisti marched to retake the city. In late June Ruffo's army entered Naples, forcing the French and their supporters to withdraw to the city's fortifications as rioting and looting broke out amongst the ill-disciplined Neapolitan troops. Dismayed by the bloodshed, Ruffo agreed to a general amnesty with the Jacobin forces that allowed them safe conduct to France. Nelson, now aboard Foudroyant, was outraged, and backed by King Ferdinand he insisted that the rebels must surrender unconditionally. He took those who had surrendered under the amnesty under armed guard, including the former Admiral Francesco Caracciolo, who had commanded the Neapolitan navy under King Ferdinand but had changed sides during the brief Jacobin rule. Nelson ordered his trial by court-martial and refused Caracciolo's request that it be held by British officers, nor was Caracciolo allowed to summon witnesses in his defence. Caracciolo was tried by royalist Neapolitan officers and sentenced to death. He asked to be shot rather than hanged, but Nelson, following the wishes of Queen Maria Carolina (a close friend of his mistress, Lady Hamilton) also refused this request and even ignored the court's request to allow 24hours for Caracciolo to prepare himself. Caracciolo was hanged aboard the Neapolitan frigate Minerva at 5 o'clock the same afternoon. Nelson kept the Jacobins imprisoned and approved of a wave of further executions, refusing to intervene despite pleas for clemency from the Hamiltons and the Queen of Naples.

The team has operated the Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) suite of plasma instruments (two Langmuir probes, a floating potential probe, and a plasma impedance probe) on ISS since 2006 to obtain in-situ measurements of plasma density and temperature along the ISS orbit and variations in ISS frame potential due to electrostatic current collection from the plasma environment (spacecraft charging) and inductive (vxB) effects from the vehicle motion across the Earth s magnetic field. An ongoing effort is to use FPMU for measuring the ionospheric response to geomagnetic storms at ISS altitudes and investigate auroral charging of the vehicle as it passes through regions of precipitating auroral electrons.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{features}} {{associated with the}} VAPEX process which make it attractive to the petroleum industry. First, VAPEX is carried out at reservoir temperature, and therefore, the heat loss does not occur. The energy requirements of a VAPEX project {{are estimated to be}} approximately 3  % of those for a SAGD project (Upreti et al. 2007). Second, some portion of the injected solvent can be recovered with the use of typical separation facilities (Butler et al. 1995). In addition, the initial capital expenditure for a VAPEX process can be substantially <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thermal project. <b>Third,</b> VAPEX boasts several benefits over thermal processes on the environmental side. During a pressure blowdown for solvent recovery, a gas must be injected to occupy the void left by the recovered solvent. A greenhouse gas such as CO 2 can be used for this purpose. This allows for the geological storage of significant amounts of CO 2 (Luhning et al. 2003). CO 2 can also be included {{as a part of the}} solvent. Finally, one of the most attractive features of VAPEX is the in situ upgrading of the oil, which occurs through asphaltene precipitation, or de-asphalting. The viscosity of the oil is drastically reduced by the removal of these components (Luo and Gu 2005; Luo et al. 2007).|$|R
