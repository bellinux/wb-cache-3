50|$|Once the gel has set, {{the comb}} is removed, leaving wells where DNA samples can be loaded. <b>Loading</b> <b>buffer</b> {{is mixed with}} the DNA sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells. The <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> {{contains}} a dense compound, which may be glycerol, sucrose, or Ficoll, that raises {{the density of the}} sample so that the DNA sample may sink {{to the bottom of the}} well. If the DNA sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation, it may float out of the well. The <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> also include colored dyes such as xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA samples are loaded using a pipette.|$|E
50|$|Samples are {{prepared}} in a standard, non-reducing <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> for SDS-PAGE. No reducing agent or boiling are necessary since these {{would interfere with}} refolding of the enzyme. A suitable substrate (e.g. gelatin or casein for protease detection) {{is embedded in the}} resolving gel during preparation of the acrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the SDS is removed from the gel (or zymogram) by incubation in unbuffered Triton X-100, followed by incubation in an appropriate digestion buffer, for an optimized length of time at 37 °C. The zymogram is subsequently stained (commonly with Amido Black or Coomassie Brilliant Blue), and areas of digestion appear as clear bands against a darkly stained background where the substrate has been degraded by the enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Since EtBr stained DNA is {{not visible}} in natural light, {{scientists}} mix DNA with negatively charged <b>loading</b> <b>buffers</b> before adding {{the mixture to}} the gel. <b>Loading</b> <b>buffers</b> are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move {{at the same speed}} as DNA of a certain length). Xylene cyanol and Bromophenol blue are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are Cresol Red and Orange G which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|A very {{widespread}} discontinuous {{buffer system}} is the tris-glycine or [...] "Laemmli" [...] system that stacks at a pH of 6.8 and resolves at a pH of ~8.3-9.0. A drawback of this system is that these pH values may promote disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues in the proteins because the pKa of cysteine ranges from 8-9 and because reducing agent present in the <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> doesn't co-migrate with the proteins. Recent advances in buffering technology alleviate this problem by resolving the proteins at a pH well below the pKa of cysteine (e.g., bis-tris, pH 6.5) and include reducing agents (e.g. sodium bisulfite) that move into the gel ahead of the proteins to maintain a reducing environment. An additional benefit of using buffers with lower pH values is that the acrylamide gel is more stable at lower pH values, so the gels can be stored {{for long periods of}} time before use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Modern Web-server systems use {{multiple}} servers {{to handle}} an increased user demand. Such systems need effective methods {{to spread the}} load among web servers evenly {{in order to keep}} web server utilization high while providing sufficient quality of service for end users. In conventional DNS-based load balancing architecture, a Doman Name Server (DNS) dispatches requests to web servers based on their load status. Because web servers need to inform the DNS server about their load status from time to time, a so-called <b>load</b> <b>buffer</b> range is often employed to reduce the update frequency. Without care, however, using a <b>load</b> <b>buffer</b> range may result in load oscillation among web servers. To address this problem, we propose a Random Early Detection (RED) method with the intuition that the probability for a web server to become overloaded in near future is directly proportional to its current load. Simulation confirms that our method helps reducing the oscillation of the web server load significantly...|$|R
30|$|As {{the network}} <b>load</b> increases, <b>buffers</b> start {{to fill up}} and {{messages}} are dropped or are not forwarded in a useful timeframe, leading to a decreased delivery ratio.

40|$|With faster CPU clocks {{and wider}} pipelines, all {{relevant}} microarchitecture components should scale accordingly. There {{have been many}} proposals for scaling the issue queue, register file, and cache hierarchy. However, nothing has been done for scaling the load/store queue, despite the increasing pressure on the load/store queue in terms of capacity and search bandwidth. The load/store queue is a CAM structure which holds in-flight memory instructions and supports simultaneous searches to honor memory dependencies and memory consistency models. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} scale the load/store queue. In this study, we introduce novel techniques to scale the load/store queue. We propose two techniques, store-load pair predictor and <b>load</b> <b>buffer,</b> to reduce the search bandwidth requirement; and one technique, segmentation, to scale the size. We show that a load/store queue using our predictor and <b>load</b> <b>buffer</b> needs only one port to outperform a conventional two-ported load/store queue. Compared to the same base case, segmentation alone achieves speedups of 5 % for integer benchmarks and 19 % for floating point benchmarks. A one-ported load/store queue using all of our techniques improves performance on average by 6 % and 23 %, and up to 15 % and 59 %, for integer and floating-point benchmarks, respectively, over a two-ported conventional load/store queue. ...|$|R

Sucrose and cresol red (gel <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> reagents) were added to a routine IgH PCR reaction mix to obviate the need for adding gel <b>loading</b> <b>buffer</b> separately after PCR amplification. Not only did this decrease the time spent after PCR analysis but also gave similar or enhanced IgH PCR product intensity compared with normal IgH PCR conditions on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This procedure was easily adapted to routine PCR analysis {{without the need for}} further manipulations or optimisation of the PCR reaction mix, and it increased the reproducibility and specificity of the IgH PCR products...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of verifying safety {{properties}} of concurrent programs running over the Total Store Order (TSO) memory model. Known decision procedures for this model are based on complex encodings of store buffers as lossy channels. These procedures assume that the number of processes is fixed. However, it is important in general to prove the correctness of a system/algorithm in a parametric way with an arbitrarily large number of processes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative (yet equivalent) semantics to the classical one for the TSO semantics that is more amenable to efficient algorithmic verification and for the extension to parametric verification. For that, we adopt a dual view where <b>load</b> <b>buffers</b> are used instead of store buffers. The flow of information is now from the memory to <b>load</b> <b>buffers.</b> We show that this new semantics allows (1) to simplify drastically the safety analysis under TSO, (2) to obtain a spectacular gain in efficiency and scalability compared to existing procedures, and (3) to extend easily the decision procedure to the parametric case, which allows obtaining a new decidability result, and more importantly, a verification algorithm that is more general and more efficient in practice than the one for bounded instances.

Apart from the well-known OBS approach using differentiated offsets to introduce multiple service classes, we consider a lookahead approach allowing for later arriving high priority packets to pre-empt earlier arrived low priority packets, and a slotted control approach. All approaches attain service differentiation without any resource reservation, and are of limited complexity, to minimize packet processing requirements. Through simulation, we assess {{the quality of the}} approaches under varying <b>loads,</b> <b>buffer</b> dimensions and QoS algorithm parameters.

Samples of whole cultures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min; then the pellets were harvested and washed three times using distilled water (6, 000 rpm/ 10 min/ 4 °C). The pellets resuspended in an equal volume of <b>loaded</b> <b>buffer</b> followed by scratching and heating at 100 °C for 5 min., the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10, 000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatants were injected in polyacrylamide gel for protein separation.|$|R

Mesh- and crosslink-based topologies reliably compensate for skew variations in these networks, albeit with a significant increase in dissipated power as compared to variation-sensitive low power clock trees. Existing crosslinkbased methods, however, only address skew from an algorithmic perspective at the network topology level. Guidelines for inserting crosslinks within a buffered low power clock tree are provided in this paper.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the relative performance impact of non-blocking <b>loads,</b> stream <b>buffers,</b> and speculative execution both used individually and {{in conjunction with}} each other. We have simulated the SPEC 92 benchmarks on a statically scheduled quad-issue processor model, running code from the Multiflow compiler. Non-blocking <b>loads</b> and stream <b>buffers</b> both provide a significant performance advantage, and their combination performs significantly better than either alone. For example, with a 64 -byte, 2 -way set associative cache with 32 cycle fetch latency, non-blocking loads reduce the run-time by 21 % while stream-buffers reduce it by 26 %, and the combined use of the two yields a 47 % reduction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to analyze the influence of trabecular microstructure modeling on the biomechanical distribution of the implant-bone interface.

These architectures however require large queues to track all loads and stores executed while a miss is pending. Hierarchical designs alleviate cycle time impact of these structures but the CAM and search functions required to enforce memory ordering and provide data forwarding place high demand on area and power. We present new load-store processing algorithms for latency tolerant architectures. We augment primary load and store queues with secondary <b>buffers.</b> The secondary <b>load</b> <b>buffer</b> is a set associative structure, similar to a cache. The secondary store buffer, the Store Redo Log, is a first-in first-out structure recording the program order of all stores completed in parallel with a miss, and has no CAM and search functions. Instead of the secondary store queue, a cache provides temporary forwarding. The SRL enforces memory ordering by ensuring memory updates occur in program order once the miss returns. The new algorithms eliminate the CAM and search functions in the secondary <b>load</b> and store <b>buffers,</b> and remove fundamental sources of complexity, power, and area inefficiency in load/store processing. The new organization, while being area and power efficient, is competitive in performance compared to hierarchical designs. 1...|$|R
