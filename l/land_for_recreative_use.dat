It was observed that tourists in the same psychographics profile demand similar transformations, while there was a noticeable difference between tourists in different profiles. The alocentrics and near-alocentrics visitors demand a more natural environment, while the other profiles demand more transformations. The Itaúnas State Park receives close to 215 thousands visitors per year. The annual benefits generated to the universe of visitors was estimated in R$ 32. 758. 992, 03 and the economic value of the Park recreative utility was R$ 116. 010. 963, 30 per year.

40|$|A {{contingent}} valuation approach {{is used to}} estimate how households value different multipurpose infrastructures (conventional or green) for managing flood risk and water pollution. As a case study we consider the Gorla Maggiore water park located in the Lombardy Region, in Northern Italy. The park is a neo-ecosystem including an infrastructure to treat waste water and store excess rain water, built in 2011 {{on the shore of}} the Olona River in an area previously used for poplar plantation. This park is the first one of this type built in Italy. A novel aspect of our research is that it not only considers the values people hold for different water ecosystem services (pollution removal, <b>recreative</b> <b>use,</b> wildlife support, flood risk reduction), but also their preferences for how those outcomes are achieved (through conventional or green infrastructures). The results indicate that the type of infrastructure delivering the ecosystem services does have an impact on individuals’ preferences for freshwater ecosystem services. Households are willing to pay from 6. 3 to 7. 1 euros per year for a green infrastructure (compared to a conventional one), with a premium up to 16. 5 euros for a surrounding made of a park. By considering the type of infrastructure within the choice model, we gain a richer understanding of the relationship between social welfare and freshwater ecosystem services...|$|R
