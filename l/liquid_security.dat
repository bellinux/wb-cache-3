40|$|I {{show that}} when an issuer has {{superior}} {{information about the}} value of its assets, it is better off selling assets separately rather than as a pool due to the information destruction effect of pooling. If, however, the issuer can create a derivative security that is collateralized by the assets, pooling and "tranching" may be optimal. If the residual risk of each asset is not highly correlated, tranching allows the issuer to exploit the risk diversification effect of pooling to create a low-risk and highly <b>liquid</b> <b>security.</b> In contrast, for an uninformed seller, pure pooling reduces underpricing and is preferred to separate asset sales. These results lead to a dynamic model of financial intermediation: originators sell pools of assets, some of which are purchased by informed intermediaries who then further pool and tranche them. Pooling and tranching allow intermediaries to leverage their capital more efficiently, enhancing the returns to their private information. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} the price di¤erences between very liquid on-therun U. S. Treasury securities and less liquid o¤-the-run securities {{over the entire}} on/o ¤ cycle.

We show that the more <b>liquid</b> <b>security</b> is priced higher on average, but that this di¤erence depends on the amount of future liquidity over its remaining lifetime rather than its current liquidity. We measure future liquidity using both quotes and trades. The liquidity measures include bid-ask spread, depth and trading activity.

40|$|Liquidity in {{government}} securities markets, despite their importance to {{both private and}} public agents, has received much attention in the literature only recently {{due to the fact that}} high-frequency data from trading in those markets were previously unavailable. This paper attempts to measure liquidity in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, where Greek government securities are traded, by estimating six different liquidity measures from high-frequency data. The most appropriate measures for this specific market are derived from the analysis and comparison of the obtained estimates. By any of the measures examined, the ten-year benchmark bond is the most <b>liquid</b> <b>security.</b> The bid-ask spread emerges as a good measure of liquidity for the pre euro area entry period, but looses part of its importance in the post euro area entry period of our sample. An interesting finding is that, in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, liquidity is only weakly related to price volatility, probably due to the specific structure of the government securities market in Greece. Therefore, trading activity is also found to be a good proxy of liquidity in this specific market. Money demand; Greek bond market, market microstructure, liquidity, order flow. ...|$|E

40|$|When {{faced with}} {{current and future}} {{liquidity}} needs, investors may behave myopically by liquidating the <b>liquid</b> <b>securities,</b> leaving the remaining portfolio vulnerable to future liquidity shocks; investors may also behave strategically by holding liquidity due to precautionary or speculative motives. Using a sample of U. S. insurers from 2001 through 2009, I directly test the theory by disentangling actuarial estimated expected liquidity need from current realized liquidity need. Empirical examination involves endogenity challenge because liquidity and trading of insurers are determined simultaneously. To address this issue, I implement the analysis in an event study (e. g. around Hurricane Katrina) framework. Controlling for regulatory constraints, insurer-level, securities-level characteristics, the analysis shows that the average insurers with large realized liquidity needs behave myopically by deleveraging the liquid securities; average insurers with large expected liquidity need behave strategically by holding and/or increasing <b>liquid</b> <b>securities,</b> and reducing illiquid securities...|$|R

Consistent with this expectation, we find a significantly positive relationship between the percentage of level 3 assets (the least <b>liquid</b> <b>securities)</b> and management fees. However, we do not find a significant relationship between level 2 securities (which are more liquid than level 3, but less liquid than level 1) and management fees.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>security</b> {{captures the}} shift from the {{solid-state}} technology {{of the criminal justice}} state to the more fluid, transient and dispersed operations of the private security industry. Despite its promise to sell security, the industry is often better known for the dangers it poses to the safety of people and property. Marked by high levels of corruption, violence, rapid staff turnover and high customer churn the private security industry cannot maintain consumer confidence or public respect. This article examines various attempts to manage the market for crime control and seeks to disclose their underlying rationale. Attempts to govern through industry self-regulation, market competition and the design and architecture of provision have failed to secure standards. Yet formal state regulation appears directed less at compliance with articulated ethical standards, a clear conception of what security is for and whom it should serve, than ensuring the health of the market. The state presents itself as facilitator, but appears as pimp, to the security industry. Regulation is sold as a ‘business opportunity ’ and compliance as the means to ensuring profitability.

40|$|The London Stock Exchange is {{constantly}} changing {{as the global}} financial landscape evolves. By aggregating detailed intraday trading data, I analyse its liquidity for a period spanning {{the introduction of a}} pure electronic order book platform for the most liquid stocks in 1997, its expansion to include less liquid stocks with market maker participation, the structural and environmental changes brought about by MiFID regulation in 2007, {{and the beginning of the}} global financial crisis. By all measures, liquidity has increased over the years, although recently intensified competition from alternative trading venues may be limiting further improvement. The most liquid stocks are the constituents of the FTSE 100 index, which are picked by largest market capitalization. When a new stock is added to this index there is a temporary price effect which I ascribe to the closing auction just before the index is revised. This is a natural time for passive investors who track the index by replicating its composition to adjust their portfolio holdings. The auction trade is facilitated by a build-up of liquidity on the opposite side of the order book in advance, as limit orders are placed in competition to take the other side of this information-free order flow at a premium. Naturally, ordinary trading in index constituents does contain information about individual stocks, groups of stocks and the entire market. Conveniently, another <b>liquid</b> <b>security</b> trades on the market which can be used as a conduit for the latter information: the FTSE 100 exchange-traded fund. Due to arbitrage opportunities its price is closely related to the index, and in fact I determine that they are cointegrated, even intraday. According to the eo integration analysis the fund makes a significant contribution to the index price discovery process, and this is especially evident when order flows are incorporated into the model.

40|$|The basic {{features}} of financial intermediation - asymmetric information and liquidity transformation - {{have not changed}} along history. In an intermediated financial system, the asymmetric information between investors and intermediaries can cause withdrawals of capital even {{in the presence of}} good investments. It is the combination of asymmetric information and illiquidity that gives rise to the possibility of a banking crisis, a situation whereby all depositors want their cash back. A securities-based financial system has the same attributes as the classic banking business model. Providing liquidity in securities markets by buying relatively illiquid securities and selling more <b>liquid</b> <b>securities</b> is the same risky activity as banking. Therefore, a security crisis is associated with an increase in demand for liquidity, or more <b>liquid</b> <b>securities.</b> This puts strain on the balance sheets of those intermediaries who provide liquidity in securities markets: their assets fall in value, including sovereign bonds of troubled countries, and their liabilities increase in value. To restore their own financial equilibrium, those intermediaries sell their assets in a situation where buyers are relatively fewer. Securities prices fall further, and this causes the “panic”, the “flight to quality”, the “run”, or whatever one chooses to call it. Short term credit dries up, including the normally straightforward repurchase agreement (“the run on repo”), interbank lending, and commercial paper markets. This panic is usually followed by a very sharp recession.

The party who initially sells the securities is effectively the borrower. Many types of institutional investors engage in repo transactions, including mutual funds and hedge funds. [...] Almost any security may be employed in a repo, though highly <b>liquid</b> <b>securities</b> are preferred as they are more easily disposed of {{in the event of}} a default and, more importantly, they can be easily obtained in the open market where the buyer has created a short position in the repo security by a reverse repo and market sale; by the same token, non <b>liquid</b> <b>securities</b> are discouraged.

The agreement might instead provide that the buyer receives the coupon, with the cash payable on repurchase being adjusted to compensate, though this is more typical of sell/buybacks.|$|R
