5|$|At the {{entrance}} of the queue, ticket inspectors check passengers' tickets for Universal Studios. The queue then <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> a forested area which later <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the Hogsmeade station building. Upon climbing a flight of steps, travellers reach the Hogsmeade station platform. Once the arriving passengers on the Hogwarts Express have left the platform, passengers waiting may then board the train and enter one of the twenty-one passenger compartments within the train.|$|E

5|$|Passage {{through the}} portal and {{octagonal}} chamber <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the mosque's central courtyard. The courtyard measures approximately 160 feet by 130 feet, and features high arched galleries surrounding a central brick paved courtyard - a typical feature of imperial Persian mosques in Iran.|$|E
5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is punctuated by a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat. This <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the second fugato episode in the key of C minor.|$|E

5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E

5|$|The {{exit from}} the complex to the Howard Beach {{neighborhood}} is on the west side, with a twisting staircase and two elevators {{going down to the}} east side of 103rd Street/Coleman Square by the T-intersection with 159th Avenue. A connecting bridge {{on the east side of}} the station <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the Airtrain JFK station.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> a ritornello. The ritornello in turn <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E

50|$|It transpired that, under true nuclear transmutation, it is {{far easier}} to turn gold <b>into</b> <b>lead</b> than the reverse reaction, which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued. Nuclear {{experiments}} have successfully transmuted <b>lead</b> <b>into</b> gold, but the expense far exceeds any gain. It {{would be easier to}} convert <b>lead</b> <b>into</b> gold via neutron capture and beta decay by leaving lead in a nuclear reactor {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R

5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E
5|$|The coast now {{shows the}} open and ancient {{landscape}} of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} continues investigating <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the Adena Watson case, {{including an}} interrogation {{of a man}} who lived {{within walking distance of the}} scene and was previously charged with murdering a 14-year-old girl. All of the leads turn into dead ends. While investigating the Adena Watson scene, police find coagulated blood and hair on a piece of metal. Battel witnesses the find, but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it, as long as she gets the story first. She also tells Bayliss about a carry-out store owner who claims to know who the murderer is. The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The front entry <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> {{the living}} room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Although Snake Pass {{is still}} the {{shortest}} route between Manchester and Sheffield, the more northerly Woodhead Pass, which is less steep and at a lower altitude, is now the primary road link between the two cities. Unlike Snake Pass, the Woodhead route is a trunk road. Traffic levels on both passes remained similar until the 1980s, but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1, while Snake Pass <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> the centre of Sheffield. Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population, {{there is no direct}} motorway link between the two. A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966, and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built, now the M67. The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement, but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District. Consequently, the plans were shelved, but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|East of MD43 and the {{adjacent}} General Services Administration facility, MD150 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane east to Carroll Island Road. East of that county highway, {{which leads to}} the community of Bowleys Quarters, the state highway reduces to two lanes. MD150 passes under a Norfolk Southern Railway spur from the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to the Charles P. Crane Generating Station and intersects Marshy Point Road, which <b>leads</b> <b>into</b> Dundee Natural Environment Area. The route ends at its intersection with Ebenezer Road and Graces Quarter Road in the community of Chase. Graces Quarter Road serves as a connector to the main section of the county highway, which heads east into a unit of Gunpowder Falls State Park. The county highway also heads west as Ebenezer Road, which passes over Eastern Avenue and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately to the northeast on Eastern Avenue. Eastern Avenue itself continues northeast as a county highway to its end at Greenbank Road on the Gunpowder River.|$|E

50|$|However, if {{the extra}} note is {{considered}} an added seventh (C), {{this is the best}} notation if the music is to <b>lead</b> <b>into</b> G major or minor. If the composer chose to <b>lead</b> <b>into</b> F major or minor, very likely the Neapolitan chord would be notated enharmonically based on C (for example: C-E-G-B), although composers vary in their practice on such enharmonic niceties.|$|R
