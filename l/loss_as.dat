25|$|The Austrians {{admitted}} 566 killed, 1,713 wounded, and 2,216 captured, for a {{total of}} 4,495 casualties. James R. Arnold pointed out that the French rarely gave accurate casualty figures, but numbered their losses in excess of 4,000, including 700 captured. David Hollins counted Austrian <b>losses</b> <b>as</b> 8,340 and French casualties as 12,000 soldiers. Francis Loraine Petre stated Austrian <b>losses</b> <b>as</b> 2,000 killed and wounded, plus 2,200 captured. He noted that Masséna reported 2,800 total losses, including 1,800 killed, giving an unlikely killed-to-wounded ratio. Of these, Legrand reported losing 701 soldiers, including only 23 from his Baden brigade. Petre wrote that Masséna claimed 7,0008,000 prisoners, while Napoleon privately wrote Lannes that 4,000 Austrians were captured. Digby Smith asserted that French casualties were 3,605 while Austrian losses were over 7,200, including 4,200 captured.

5|$|The Athletics {{made the}} postseason and again played the Yankees in the ALDS. Zito pitched in Game 3 against Mike Mussina. He went eight innings, {{striking}} out six, walking one, and allowing an earned run. But Zito took the <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> the Yankees won the game, 1–0. The Yankees {{would end up}} taking the series, 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} endured by both armies differs according to the authors. The Italian Jesuit Famiano Strada noted that Farnese, {{in a letter to}} his father Ottavio, Duke of Parma, put the Dutch <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> 600 men killed and gave eight men killed and 40 wounded amongst his troops. Strada also mentions that other estimations pointed to 1,040 men killed in the Dutch ranks. On the other hand, the Flemish author Guillaume Baudart set the Dutch <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> 200 men killed and claimed that the Spanish Army lost 500 men. The villages of Deurne and Borgerhout were seriously damaged by the fire during the battle: in 1580 Deurne had 133 standing buildings, while 146 had been destroyed by the fire; in Borgerhout 206 buildings remained and 280 were ruined.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt's time in {{the bullpen}} did not last long. On May 3, he {{replaced}} Bryan Rekar in the Royals' starting rotation. In his first start, he pitched four innings, gave up one run, and earned a nodecision in a 43 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Affeldt's time as a starter garnered so-so results, as he was 04 with a 5.45 ERA in seven starts. In his last start, on June 8, Affeldt picked up the <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> the Royals fell 113 to the St. Louis Cardinals. After getting pulled in the fourth inning due to an injury, Affeldt {{was placed on the}} disabled list with fingernail and blister problems.|$|E

5|$|After the Florida loss, Alabama's senior {{starting}} quarterback, John David Phillips, {{was replaced}} by freshman Andrew Zow. With Zow as the new starter, Alabama proceeded to win its next two games: 2017 against Ole Miss and 2322 against East Carolina. On October 24, Zow endured his first <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> the team's starting quarterback when Alabama was defeated, 3518, by eventual SEC (and national) champion Tennessee. Alabama rebounded from the loss by reeling off two more wins: 3020 against Southern Miss and an upset 2216 win over LSU, in which the Crimson Tide scored 15 points in 144 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory <b>loss).</b> <b>As</b> the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> a result of ear infections.

After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw in which she first eliminated Wilson and then Mickie James and Ashley at the same time, Candice Michelle received her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but she lost to champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the <b>loss.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the tension between the women, Wilson became a fan favorite, while Candice Michelle and Victoria continued to act as villains on-screen.|$|E
5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for {{their failure to}} choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' <b>loss,</b> <b>as</b> the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E

5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E

Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 {{in front of their}} home crowd with a 112–109 <b>loss.</b> <b>As</b> the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A.

5|$|John Fortescue's History of the British Army {{says that}} Howe's {{casualties}} numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians. However, Rodney Atwood {{points out that}} Fortescue's figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19–28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains. This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed, wounded or missing at White Plains. Henry Dawson, on the other hand, gives Howe's <b>loss</b> <b>as</b> 47 killed, 182 wounded and 4 missing.|$|E

On May 3, the Blue Jays announced that Loup would replace Sergio Santos as the team's closer until Casey Janssen returned from injury. After walking as many batters in three months as he had the entire last season, Loup regained confidence after pitching the last few innings of a game on June 4 that went from a 3–2 lead to an 8–2 win against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} Raw, the Shield faced the Usos {{in a number}} one contender's match, in which the winner {{has the right to}} face the tag team champions for the title. The Rhodes Brothers were commentating and eventually interfered in the match, causing a no contest. As a result, the Rhodes Brothers faced both the Shield and the Usos in a triple threat tag team match for the tag titles at Hell in a Cell and successfully retained it.
