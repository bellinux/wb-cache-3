40|$|Proved by {{numerous}} studies, the laser-induced energy deposition is applied for wave drag reduction in supersonic flow. Due to the optical air breakdown threshold of about 10 ˆ 9 W/cm² (for CO 2 -laser radiation in atmospheric conditions), the experimental realisation nowadays is still {{restricted to the}} pulsed regime of solid-state and gas laser systems (ns- to µs time domains). A reasonable use of this flow control principle requires the increase of deposited energy in air. In a <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> application, the phase shift determines the energy absorption. The measured phase shift, realized by a Nomarski interferometer setup, indicates the electron density of the laser induced air breakdown. Numerical, 3 -dimensional spatial and temporal simulations of focused pulse propagation in air are compared with the experimental measurements of the electron density in the breakdown region. Furthermore, scaling ideas for prospective <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> experiments to reduce the wave drag will be presented. In the near future, a laboratory experiment is planned to align a pulsed (ns-regime) and a continuous wave (kW-regime) laser system in order to initialize and extend the laser-induced plasma...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the preliminary {{results of an}} ongoing study of microwave scattering from a laser-induced, small-volume plasma in room air. Microwave scattering from the precursor and after-spark evolution reveal the dynamic characteristics of the laser spark formation, growth and decay. In particular, the avalanche ionization phase is detected by microwave scattering in the precursor part, during and shortly after the laser pulse. A simplified model of the microwave scattering from this early stage of <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> is presented and shown to qualitatively fit the experimental results. Subsequent features of the microwave signal provide further insight into the after-spark evolution and are still under study.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the demands}} for {{lowering}} the burdens on the environment {{will continue to grow}} steadily, understanding of pollutant emission characteristics becomes more and more important to minimize environmental disruption. These pollutant emission conditions cannot be estimated in real-time using conventional mass-based methods because of their low concentrations in air or exhaust gases. Therefore, new evaluation criteria are required for better understanding of their characteristics. In this study, the <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> time-of-flight mass spectrometry was developed and applied to hydrocarbons to detect the elemental composition of gas phase materials. The laser wavelength dependence of this method was evaluated using 1064 and 266 nm laser outputs. Signals from fragments of hydrocarbons appeared using 266 nm. On the other hand, {{it was found that the}} mass spectra of atoms can be detected using the 1064 nm <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> process without intermediate fragment signals. This feature is important to detect atomic signals of the measured materials without the interference of fragmentations. The pressure effect was also evaluated to enhance the detection limit. The higher pressure tends to induce the higher atomic signals. The detection limit can easily reach to ppb or less. The signal intensity was proportional to the concentration of hydrocarbons introduced. The method was applied to various hydrocarbons and the breakdown characteristics of these molecules were taken for the quantitative analysis. Compared with conventional measurements, this method has a lot of merits of the simple signal analysis, real-time and sensitive detection features. The method can cover various industrial applications including the exhaust analysis of combustors, environmental monitoring of air, and plant monitoring for safety and security...|$|E

We also made ab initio calculations of the electronic lifetime of conduction electrons in the energy range produced in the UPS experiment. Such calculations show that the lifetime suddenly diminishes when the conduction electron energy reaches the plasmon energy, whereas the UPS spectra show evidence in this range of a strong relaxation mechanism with an increased production of low energy secondary electrons. We propose {{that in this case}} the electronic relaxation proceeds in two steps : excitation of a plasmon by the high energy electron, the latter decaying into individual electron-hole pairs, {{as in the case of}} metals.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{generation}} of molecular hydrogen from water by laser irradiation, without any electrodes and photocatalysts. A near infrared pulsed nanosecond laser is used for exposure of colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles suspended in water. Laser exposure of the colloidal solution results in formation of plasma of <b>laser</b> <b>breakdown</b> of liquid and emission of H 2. The rate of H 2 emission depends critically on the energy of laser pulses. There is a certain threshold in laser fluence in liquid (around 50 J/cm 2) below which plasma disappears and H 2 emission stops. H 2 emission from colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles in ethanol is higher than that from similar water colloid. It is found that formation of plasma and emission of H 2 or D 2 can be induced by laser exposure of pure liquids, either H 2 O or D 2 O, respectively. The results are interpreted as water molecules splitting by direct electron impact from breakdown plasma. Comment: 12 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Various {{applications}} are currently motivating {{interest in the}} transmission of very high laser intensities through optical fibers.

This breakdown results in subtle surface modifications that can leave the surface more resistant to further breakdown or damage events. Catastrophic fiber damage can also occur {{as a result of a}} number of different mechanisms, with damage appearing at fiber end faces, within the initial ``entry`` segment of the fiber path, and at other internal sites due to effects related to the particular fiber routing.

This scheme could potentially provide ignition within a combustion system with a laser trigger leading to breakdown of an air-fuel flow within a high-voltage gap using a compact low power laser source. The laser scheme involves resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) in molecular oxygen and subsequent laser field-enhanced electron avalanche to generate a pre-ionized micro-plasma path between high voltage electrodes and thus guide the ignition spark through fuel-rich areas of the air-fuel flow.
