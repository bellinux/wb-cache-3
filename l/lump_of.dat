5|$|A sequel titled Tayutama 2: You're the Only One was {{announced}} on April 24, 2015 to commemorate <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Sugar's 10th anniversary and released on September 23, 2016. The game was submitted to Steam Greenlight by Chinese publisher Hikari Field on September 15, 2016. An append disc for Tayutama 2, featuring {{the characters of}} Tayutama, was released to users who purchased <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Sugar's previous titles, Rensō Relation and Kodomo no Asobi.|$|E
5|$|Tayutama is {{the third}} title {{developed}} by <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Sugar. The visual novel's scenario was written by Chihiro Fumikata. The character designs and illustrations for the visual novel were drawn by Fumitake Moekibara; Moekibara also served the same position for <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Sugar's previous titles. The game's music was composed entirely by Shigenobu Ōkawa, who {{was also one of}} the two composers for Itsuka, Todoku, Ano Sora ni.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E

5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets {{appear to}} follow very {{different}} fading laws. The JFCs are active {{over a lifetime}} of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages. Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> rock or rubble that can resemble an asteroid. Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets. Roughly six percent of the near-Earth asteroids {{are thought to be}} extinct comet nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} from Tayutama also appear in video games created by other developers. Ameri, Mashiro, and Mifuyu were featured as playable {{characters in the}} fighting game Twinkle Queen. The game was released on August 26, 2010 for Wii, and also featured {{characters from}} The Devil on G-String, Windmill's Shukufuku no Campanella, and BaseSon's Shin Koihime Musō. Ameri and Mashiro were also featured as characters in Illusion's Characolle! 3D animation program series. The program's fourth entry, Characolle! <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Sugar, was released on July 1, 2011, and included the characters' models and scenery assets based on Tayutama locales {{as part of the}} package.|$|E

50|$|I have in {{mind the}} {{occasion}} when Marcel Duchamp got hold of some friends to show them a cage which {{seemed to have no}} birds in it, but to be half-full <b>of</b> <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> sugar. He asked them to lift the cage and they were surprised at its heaviness. What they had taken for <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> sugar were really small <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> marble which at great expense Duchamp had had sawn up specially for the purpose. The trick in my opinion is no worse than any other, and I would even say that it is worth nearly all the tricks of art put together.|$|R
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed and will {{continue}} to cool almost indefinitely, eventually to become a black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
