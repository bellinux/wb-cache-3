50|$|The {{ship was}} donated to Parks Canada and was {{gradually}} restored until 1966, when city authorities agreed {{to move the}} ship to its present location, at that time part of a squatters area. The task required three bulldozers, eight tons of Palmolive soap, a crew of twelve men, and three weeks to complete. Greased <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> eased the process.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} heart rate responses during competitive log rolling matches and to measure select physiological characteristics of elite <b>log</b> <b>rollers.</b> Subjects included 7 male and 11 female elite log rolling athletes between the ages of 18 and 44 years of age that competed in a log rolling competition. HR recordings were collected for each subject during a competitive match...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial {{country music}} {{recordings}} started in 1927 with versions by Red Patterson's Piedmont <b>Log</b> <b>Rollers</b> (as [...] "Down By The Banks Of The Ohio") and by Grayson and Whitter (as [...] "I'll Never Be Yours"). Other early country music stars who recorded the song included Ernest Stoneman (1928), The Callahan Brothers (1934), The Blue Sky Boys (1936), Clayton McMichen (1931) and The Monroe Brothers (1936). The Blue Sky Boys version {{appears in the}} soundtrack of the 1973 film Paper Moon.|$|R
50|$|The Crawford-Dorsey House in Lovejoy, Georgia {{was first}} begun by Wm. Crawford in circa 1820. The area was then Henry County. Then in the mid-1850s Mr. Stephen Dorsey bought the home. He then moved {{his home on}} <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> {{to the site of}} the Crawford home and {{connected}} the two homes together to form one residence. In 1858, this part of Henry County became Clayton County. Mr. Dorsey also became a Judge for the county. He was married to Lucinda McConnell.|$|R
50|$|The Episcopal {{congregation}} {{that built}} {{the church in}} 1881 was founded in 1872, and {{is believed to be}} Limestone's first organized church group. It originally met in a school before having this building built. The building was originally located on the Grand Falls Road where the Protestant Cemetery continues to stand. The church was moved on <b>log</b> <b>rollers,</b> using horses to its present location over several months in 1896. It was reported in 1904 that its tower had been raised to accommodate the belfry.|$|R
50|$|In Māori tradition, Waipapa {{was one of}} {{the great}} ocean-going, voyaging canoes that was used in the migrations that settled New Zealand. In the Māori traditions of Northland, the Waipapa is said to have landed in Doubtless Bay. The captain asked his crew to take tawapou <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> off the canoe, which had been carried from Hawaiki, and plant them on the slopes of a nearby hill. From the rollers grew a grove of tawapou trees that today serve as a {{memorial}} of the arrival of the canoe.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, {{the church}} {{building}} was moved on <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> drawn by horses {{from its original}} location to a plot of land owned by the parish. The parish hall (built ca 1900) already stood on this site, and the church was placed alongside that building.A two story addition was built in 1949 to provide room for Sunday School, offices, a kitchen, and general purpose space.The historic chapel has remained in continuous use since {{it was built in}} 1774.Trinity Church is located at 182 NC Hwy 33 West in Chocowinity.|$|R
50|$|As well as animals, {{the park}} has several rides: a <b>log</b> flume, <b>roller</b> coasters, ghost trains, and dodgem cars. One of the roller coasters, named Eurofighter, has a 97 degree drop.|$|R
40|$|Log rolling vvas once a sport {{found only}} at {{traditional}} lumberjack competitions, but now {{has evolved into}} a recreational physical activity available to the public. The advent of the Key Log� has made this possible. The Key Log� is a synthetic log, whicl 1 can be filled with water and has three removable paddles that help to govern rolling speed. 1 "he {{purpose of this study was}} to determine relative exercise intensity and caloric expenditure of <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> using the Key Log�. Nineteen novice (n= 7) and elite (n= 12) <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> completed up to seven rounds of log rolling dependi 11 g on their ability. The seven rolling conditions were: 1) Key Log� with three paddles, 2) Key Log� with two paddles, 3) Key Log� with one paddle, 4) Key Log� with no paddles, 5) Key Log� against another participant, 6) cedar log, and 7) cedar log against another participant. Heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (V 02), and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were recorded. It was fou 11 d that HR was between 69 o/o a 11 d 91 % of predicted max HR and caloric expenditure was betwee 11 6. 2 and 10. 3 kcal per minute depending on rolling condition and roller ability. These results indicate tl 1 at log rolling on the Key Log� meets American College of Sports Medicine criteria for i 1 nproving cardiorespiratory endurance and can potentially affect body composition...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century (and {{possibly}} even earlier), the area featured a one-room schoolhouse {{known as the}} Pleasant Plains School. Located {{on the north side}} of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Laird's Corner, it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its one-room schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools. Moved across the road on <b>log</b> <b>rollers,</b> it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development. Instead, it was moved to the Township's Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation.|$|R

50|$|These {{tasks are}} by default {{the realm of}} wireline. Because coiled tubing is rigid, it can be pushed into the well from the surface. This is an {{advantage}} over wireline, which depends on {{the weight of the}} toolstring to be lowered into the well. For highly deviated and horizontal wells, gravity may be insufficient for wireline <b>logging.</b> <b>Roller</b> stem and tractors can often overcome this disadvantage at greatly reduced cost, particularly on small platforms and subsea wells where coiled tubing would require mobilizing an expensive mobile drilling rig. The use of coiled tubing for these tasks is usually confined to occasions where it is already on site for another purpose, for example a logging run following a chemical wash.|$|R
50|$|The hotel served {{passengers}} on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, which terminated in Three Forks until 1927, when the line was extended to Gallatin Gateway. The original building was the Madison Hotel, built in 1862 on the original Three Forks townsite, and moved on <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> a mile to its present location. At the time, the Milwaukee Depot was across the street, though the railroad That building now is the eastern portion of the current structure, housing support facilities. In 1910, the main lobby and 29 rooms were constructed by railroad agent John Q. Adams, who hired architect Fred Willson to create a grand but warm and welcoming design.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} acquired {{at auction}} {{had to be}} moved from the city property. Moving the various buildings required patience and ingenuity {{in an era when}} horses provided the motive power. Each building was moved without being dismantled. It would be gently moved off it foundation onto a bed of logs which served as rollers. A team of horses worked a large windlass which was set {{up in front of the}} building in the direction it was to be moved. Ropes from the building were attached to the windlass and as the horses turned it, the building was pulled forward off its foundation and across the <b>log</b> <b>rollers.</b> Once the edge of the bed of logs was reached, the logs from behind the house were moved to the front, the windlass advanced further.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{archaeologist}} Charles Love experimented with a 10-tonne replica. His first experiment found rocking the statue to walk {{it was too}} unstable over {{more than a few}} hundred yards. He then found that placing the statue upright on two sled runners atop <b>log</b> <b>rollers,</b> 25 men were able to move the statue [...] in two minutes. In 2003, further research indicated this method could explain supposedly regularly spaced post holes (his research on this claim has not yet been published) where the statues were moved over rough ground. He suggested the holes contained upright posts {{on either side of the}} path so that as the statue passed between them, they were used as cantilevers for poles to help push the statue up a slope without the requirement of extra people pulling on the ropes and similarly to slow it on the downward slope. The poles could also act as a brake when needed.|$|R
50|$|The wheel {{alone is}} not a machine, but when {{attached}} to an axle in conjunction with bearing, it forms the wheel and axle, one of the simple machines. A driven wheel {{is an example of}} a wheel and axle. Note that wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round <b>logs</b> as <b>rollers</b> to move a heavy load—a practice going back in pre-history so far, it has not been dated.|$|R
50|$|Funeral {{ceremonies and}} burials can be delayed for decades {{during which the}} bodies of the {{deceased}} are kept in the homes of the living. Once sufficient funds have been acquired, {{it is not unusual for}} several generations of Sumbans to be buried or reburied together in segmented compartments of the below-ground tomb in a manner that does not violate incest taboos. While some now use winches and cattle trucks to lift and transport these stones, and others construct them out of cement, the practice of hauling slabs of rock weighing up to 70 tons atop <b>log</b> <b>rollers</b> across the countryside by hand persists in some eastern parts of the island. The actual event is preceded by months of negotiations between allied clans and villages culminating in hundreds of men participating in the tarik batu stone-pulling ceremony. Failure to perform the necessary rites, including the butchering of large numbers of buffalo, cows, pigs and occasionally horses, and nightly protection rituals at the quarries where the stones are cut, risks a violent reaction from malevolent ancestral forces whose approval is sought through the divining of animal innards.|$|R
50|$|The pagpalpag or the {{hammering}} {{phase is}} gradually done by beating the bariw leaves against a flat stone until they become soft and pliable {{with the use}} of a wooden club known as sampok. In some cases, bariw leaves are softened with an improvised <b>roller</b> <b>log</b> made of tree or coconut trunk that works like a rolling pin.|$|R
50|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. The arid spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, and as such the bird is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and <b>logging.</b> This ground <b>roller</b> is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{in about}} 1846, the Joseph Aram party found an {{alternate}} route {{on the south}} side of Donner Lake. Their route ran past the future town of Truckee, California up Coldstream Canyon south of Donner Lake to a 7800 ft saddle between Mt. Judah and Mt. Lincoln, about two miles (3 km) south of Donner's pass. Here the final climb was up over the somewhat higher but less precipitous Roller Pass. The oxen were taken to the top where they could pull on more or less level ground and about 400 ft of chain was let down to a wagon and twelve or more yoke of oxen then pulled the wagon up the final steep (about 30 degree) slope. To minimize friction on the chain it ran over round <b>logs</b> (<b>rollers)</b> put at the top.(Roller Pass Truckee Trail Map) By not requiring dis-assembly and allowing the wagon to stay packed this was a much faster way to the top but was still tortuously slow taking two to three days or longer to get to the top with wagon, people, animals and goods. In about 1848 or 1849 a large group of pioneers cut a switchback trail over the final steep section of Roller Pass, eliminating the need for rollers and chains to get over Roller Pass. From the top of the pass all the pioneers could see was a rugged mountain slope headed west that would require almost 80 mi more of strenuous and dangerous effort to get to their goals.|$|R
30|$|If {{the rotor}} of the pump stalls, a {{two-tone}} emergency alarm will sound. After interrogation with the device programmer, the device display indicates a ‘Motor Stall’. When no motor stall is indicated {{and this is}} not derived from the pump <b>logs,</b> a <b>roller</b> study should be performed in case failure is suspected (Fig. 12). In this procedure, the pump is programmed in the continuous infusion mode, using a preset, without activation and with a priming bolus of 10  μl with a duration of 1  min. With fluoroscopy, the rotor is visualised, thereby reducing the aperture. A plain radiographic image is made and the preset bolus delivery is activated. After 2  min, a new plain radiographic image is made and the two images are compared. In a normal pump function, the rollers have moved approximately 60 ° from their original position. The extra radiopaque dot on one of the roller arms helps to visualise the roller movement (Fig. 12).|$|R
50|$|Dixie Landin' {{was built}} in 1999. Some of its rides came from the now defunct Fun Fair Park which was located at the {{intersection}} of Florida Boulevard and Airline Highway. It includes rides for all ages, including kiddie rides and thrill seeker rides. It currently has 27 attractions, including an S&S combo drop tower, a <b>log</b> flume, four <b>roller</b> coasters, and a variety of flat rides. The Drop Tower, Hot Shot, was originally the O2 Tower from Panama City Beach, Florida's now defunct Miracle Strip Amusement Park. In 2008, Hurricane Gustav destroyed the Coca-Cola concert stage, however, a new one {{was built in}} time for the 2009 season.|$|R
