The leilending (tenant farmer) tax was a property tax where farms were divided into three groups {{depending on the size}} of the farms (full farms, half farms, and deserted farms). The tax was from the 1640s dependent on the land rent. In 1665, Norway got its first <b>land</b> <b>register</b> (...) with a land rent that reflected the value of the production of the farm.

2500|$|In Year 5 of Shoshenq I, this {{king and}} the founder of the 22nd Dynasty, {{dispatched}} a certain Ma (i.e., Libyan) subordinate named Wayheset to the desert oasis town of Dakhla in order to restore Shoshenq I's authority over the western oasis region of Upper Egypt. Wayheset's titles include Prince and Governor of the Oasis. His activities are recorded in the Large Dakhla stela. [...] This stela states that Wayheset adjudicated in a certain water dispute by consulting a land-register which is explicitly dated to Year 19 of a [...] "Pharaoh Psusennes" [...] {{in order to determine the}} water rights of a man named Nysu-Bastet. Kitchen notes that this individual made an appeal to the Year 19 cadastral land-register of king Psusennes belonging to his mother, which historians assumed was made some [...] "80 years" [...] before during the reign of Psusennes I. The <b>land</b> <b>register</b> recorded that certain water rights were formerly owned by Nysu-Bastet's mother Tewhunet in Year 19 of a king Psusennes. This ruler was generally assumed by Egyptologists to be Psusennes I rather than Psusennes II since the latter's reign was believed to have lasted only 14–15 years. Based on the <b>land</b> <b>register</b> evidence, Wayheset ordered that these watering rights should now be granted to Nysu-Bastet himself. However, if the oracle dated to Year 19 of Psusennes I as many scholars traditionally assumed, Nysu-Bastet would have been separated from his mother by a total of 80 years from this date into Year 5 of Shoshenq I—a figure which is highly unlikely since Nysu-Bastet would not have waited until extreme old age to uphold his mother's watering rights. This implies that the aforementioned king Psusennes here must be identified with Psusennes II instead—Shoshenq I's immediate predecessor and, more significantly, that Psusennes II enjoyed a minimum reign of 19 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the <b>Registered</b> <b>Land</b> Act 1963 of Kenya has established an effective system of law and practice governing titles to <b>land</b> <b>registered</b> under the Act. Several key issues are addressed. First, how effective has been the process of land adjudication which brings onto the <b>register</b> <b>land</b> that was formerly subject to customary law; moreover, how successful has been the process of converting land that was subject to one of the preexisting systems of registration. Secondly, how effective is the conveyancing machinery provided by the Act. Thirdly, are the rights of registered proprietors, including those registered jointly or in common, as well as persons with third party interests in land adequately protected by the Act? Fourthly, to what extent have the provisions of the Magistrates' Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act 1981 undermined the provisions of the <b>Registered</b> <b>Land</b> Act 1963 ? In answering these questions the relevant provisions of the <b>Registered</b> <b>Land</b> Act 1963 are compared with those of the English Land Registration Act 1925. This thesis considers the extent to which judicial interpretation of the provisions of the Land Registration Act 1925 can assist in solving some of the problems created by the provisions of the <b>Registered</b> <b>Land</b> Act 1963.
