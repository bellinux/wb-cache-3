40|$|To {{explore the}} safety of the {{standard}} and the <b>low</b> hospital <b>bed,</b> we report on a microanalysis of 15 patients’ ability to ingress, move about the bed, and egress. The 15 participants were purposefully selected with various disabilities. Bed conditions were randomized with side rails up or down and one <b>low</b> <b>bed</b> with side rails down. We explored the patients’ use of the side rails, bed height, ability to lift their legs onto the mattress, and ability to turn, egress, and walk back to the chair. The standard bed was too high for some participants, both for ingress and egress. Side rails were used by most participants when entering, turning in bed, and exiting. We recommend that side rails be reconsidered as a means to facilitate in-bed movement, ingress, and egress. Furthermore, single deck height settings for all patients are not optimal. <b>Low</b> <b>beds</b> as a safety measure must be re-evaluated...|$|R

60|$|Oglethorpe {{lay in a}} <b>low</b> <b>bed,</b> one {{of several}} in a long garret of the inn. The rain soaked in places through the roof and fell in minute drops; there was but one small window; the beds were {{occupied}} by servants, {{the air of the}} garret was both close and chilly. Mr. Archer's heart sank at the threshold to see a man lying perhaps mortally hurt in so poor a sick-room, and as he drew near the <b>low</b> <b>bed</b> he took his hat off. The guard was a big, blowsy, innocent-looking soul with a thick lip and a broad nose, comically turned up; his cheeks were crimson, and when Mr. Archer laid a finger on his brow he found him burning with fever.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>beds</b> of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the <b>lowest</b> <b>beds</b> in the formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2mya, while agreeing with an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, Bay Creek Railway began {{operating}} a self-propelled dining car along BCR track, making {{one to two}} hour round trips from Cape Charles. This passenger excursion service uses a restored interurban railcar, built in 1913 by St. Louis Car Company. It originally served the former Texas Electric Railway in Dallas, Texas as car number 316. When Texas Electric ceased operating in 1948, its fleet of interurban railcars was sold for salvage. Car number 316 {{was used as a}} cabin at a ranch in Fort Worth, Texas until its recent restoration for the Bay Creek Railway. [...] By December 21, 2011 the car was listed for sale on the Ozark Mountain Railcar equipment broker website. The initial asking price was $260,000, later reduced to $205,000.
