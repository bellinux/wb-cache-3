25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or <b>linear</b> <b>actuators.</b> The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E

We draw up governing equations which are composed by combination of electromagnetic theories and empirical knowledge, and deduct {{the values of}} major design factors by use of them. We suggested the governing equations to determine the values of design parameters of <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> as like bobbin size, length of yoke and plunger and turn number of coil. And we also calculated the life test time of <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> for verification of reliability of the prototype. In addition, for reducing the life test time, the acceleration model of <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> is proposed and the acceleration factor is calculated considering the field operating conditions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{dielectric}} barrier discharge plasma actuators in low Re flow control applications. Three different actuator geometries have been tested: a conven-tional design using two rectangular strip electrodes (the <b>linear</b> <b>actuator)</b> that produces a nearly two-dimensional horizontal wall jet upon actuation, and two new designs that render the plasma induced flow {{in the form of}} a vertical jet that can be either three-dimensional using an annular electrode array actuator construction- the plasma synthetic jet actuator, PSJA or nearly two dimensional using a modified <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> construction consisting of two exposed electrodes and one embedded electrode, the L-PSJA. The modification in actuator design can be used to broaden its applicability and enhance the flow control ef-fects. 2 -D PIV measurements are used to characterize the operation of these actuators in quiescent flow, a flat plate boundary layer, and flow over a circular cylinder. In qui-escent flow, these actuators add momentum to the residual fluid with significant velocity fluctuations. The interaction of the plasma induced flow with a mean flow is shown to vary with the actuator geometry. The PSJA and L-PSJA geometries enhance the penetration of the plasma induced jet as compared to the <b>linear</b> <b>actuator.</b> The actuators act as an active boundary layer trip, the effectiveness of which is seen to decrease with increasing freestream velocity. While the PSJA affects the global flowfield, the L-PSJA and <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> affect primarily the near wall region. The <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> is observed to be a better configuration for flow control on a circular cylinder as opposed to the L-PSJA. I...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> {{applications}} are {{addressed by the}} use of hydraulic systems. The high maintenance cost and poor reliability will always be the most critical problem in the real applications. Benefited from both the high mechanical advantage of the roll screw and the simple structure of the switched reluctance motor, a new SRM driven <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> is proposed as a replacement for the traditional hydraulic system. The key factor is to improve drive system reliability without losing the high thrust / high power density characteristic of the original system. Through the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) project example, the detail of the magnetic design is done step-by-step to maximize the SRM power density. The technique credibility is crosschecked by both the SRDaS software and the finite element method. For further improvement of system reliability, converter structure, sensorless control and fault tolerance ability are also investigated. Both the computer simulation and the experimental results verified the validity of the high thrust <b>linear</b> <b>actuator</b> design.

50|$|Pneumatic actuators, or {{pneumatic}} cylinders, {{are similar}} to hydraulic actuators except they use compressed gas to generate force instead of a liquid. They work similarly to a piston in which air is pumped inside a chamber and pushed out {{of the other side}} of the chamber. Air actuators are not necessarily used for heavy duty machinery and instances where large amounts of weight are present. One of the reasons pneumatic <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> are preferred to other types is the fact that the power source is simply an air compressor. Because air is the input source, pneumatic actuators are able to be used in many places of mechanical activity. The downside is, most air compressors are large, bulky, and loud. They are hard to transport to other areas once installed. Pneumatic <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> are likely to leak and this makes them less efficient than mechanical <b>linear</b> <b>actuators.</b>|$|E

50|$|The DPS employs two <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> and {{a central}} {{pivoting}} armature {{that holds the}} iris. The two parallel <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> have coordinated motion {{in such a way}} as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The <b>linear</b> <b>actuators</b> consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic yoke assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.|$|E
