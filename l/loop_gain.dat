25|$|Non-zero output {{impedance}}: Low {{output impedance}} {{is important for}} low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open <b>loop</b> <b>gain.</b> In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.|$|E

25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the {{feedback}} is not limited to a frequency divider. This element can be other elements such as a frequency multiplier, or a mixer. The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the reference frequency. A mixer can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset. It may also be a combination of these. An example being a divider following a mixer; this allows the divider to operate at a much lower frequency than the VCO without a loss in <b>loop</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finite gain: Open-loop gain is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} <b>loop</b> <b>gain</b> (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where closed-loop gain must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} reference tracking in switched-mode power converters {{in terms of both}} large-signal and small-signal perspectives. Common control schemes, namely, voltage mode, current mode, and V 2 -control, are compared for their performance in reference tracking. For small-signal analysis, <b>loop</b> <b>gains</b> and reference-to-output transfer functions are analytically derived and verified by the proposed Matlab-based frequency response simulator. In the case of multiple-loop control like V 2 -control, different <b>loop</b> <b>gains</b> are clarified for their application in load transient or reference tracking. Practical circuit-level design considerations are given to current-mode control for achieving fast reference tracking, while end-point prediction (EPP) is used to improve V 2 -control, which is inherently slow in reference tracking. The effect of EPP on transfer function is then explained in details. A V 2 -controlled buck converter with EPP is fabricated. The measured reference-tracking response shows ten times improvement in tracking speed and verifies the effectiveness of EPP in V 2 -control. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|Disadvantages of CFAs include poorer input {{offset voltage}} and input bias current characteristics. Additionally, the DC <b>loop</b> <b>gains</b> are {{generally}} smaller by about three decimal orders of magnitude. Given their substantially greater bandwidths, {{they also tend to}} be noisier.

2500|$|Classification by {{internal}} compensation: op-amps may suffer from high frequency instability in some negative feedback circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op-amps {{with a built-in}} capacitor are termed [...] "compensated", and allow circuits above some specified closed-loop gain to operate stably with no external capacitor.

2500|$|An {{operational}} amplifier is an amplifier circuit which typically has very high open <b>loop</b> <b>gain</b> and differential inputs.

[...] In these applications the more complex digital phase detectors are used which do not have as severe a reference spur component on their output. Also, when in lock, the steady-state phase difference at the inputs using this type of phase detector is near 90 degrees.
