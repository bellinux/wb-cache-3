40|$|Canada (FERIC) {{undertook}} {{a series of}} studies to investigate the potential of using a combination of technologies to extend <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> operations during the traditional spring break-up period. During spring break-up, thin pavement roads are weakened, resulting in the application of government-imposed load restrictions to prevent road damage from heavy haul traffic. These load restrictions typically result in the suspension of <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> operations for a period of six to ten weeks. The undertaken studies examined the use of Central Tire Inflation (CTI) systems in combination with a variety of axle arrangements on log trucks to minimize road damage while hauling full loads during the traditional load restriction period...|$|R

This main block measures 28 ft in depth and 42 ft in width, and was built from <b>logs</b> <b>hauled</b> to the site from Camden. The house was enlarged by Allen's son in 1907, and has been little altered since. The road it is located on (County Road 40) was once the main road between Magnolia and El Dorado.|$|R

The investigation comes to the following conclussions : 1. Logging Companies in Riau, Jambi and South Sumatera use poorly constructed forest roads without any graveling. 2. On the other hand those in South Kalimantan are relatively good graveled roads. 3. Effective hauling outputs of trucks range from 91 to 361 m 3 km/round trip hour, with an average of 247 m 3 km/round trip hour, and those of semi-trailer truck from 265 to 841 m 3 km/round trip hour, with an average of 494 m 3 km/round trip hour. There is pronounced linier relation between hauling distance and round trip time...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year field {{experiment}} (fall 1990 -spring 1993) showed that woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) altered their dispersion when <b>logs</b> were <b>hauled</b> through their traditional wintering area. Unlike observations in control years 1 and 3, radio-collared caribou that {{had returned to}} the study area before the road was plowed on January 6 of the experimental year 2, moved away 8 - 60 km after logging activities began. Seasonal migration to Lake Nipigon islands usually peaked in April, but by February 22 of year 2, 4 of the 6 had returned. The islands provide summer refuge from predation, but not when the lake is frozen. Tracks in snow showed that some caribou remained but changed locations. They used areas near the road preferentially in year 1, early year 2, and year 3, but moved away 2 - 5 km after the road was plowed in year 2. In a nearby undisturbed control area, no such changes occurred. Caribou and moose partitioned habitat on a small scale; tracks showed gray wolf (Canis lupus) remote from caribou but close to moose tracks. No predation on caribou was observed within the wintering area; 2 kills were found outside it. Due to the possibility of displacing caribou from winter refugia to places with higher predation risk, <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> through important caribou winter habitat should be minimized...|$|R

40|$|With the {{agricultural}} {{economy of the}} Central Pyrenees in steady decline, natural forest stands are colonising abandoned agricultural meadows. The present study seeks to define the economic conditions for a new fuel-wood local economy based on these extensions of the forest cover. Farmer/forest owners are capable of exploiting this resource, involving <b>logging,</b> <b>hauling</b> and cutting the wood to size, to meet their own heating needs. In this way, owners could thus recuperate a maximum unit value estimated at 11. 2 to 22. 3  € per stere (1 cubic metre), or an average value of 16. 8  € per stere after deduction of all costs. An economy based on wood energy, using wood from spontaneously generated forest growth on private land, is therefore possible. A development policy for such an activity could be envisaged with appropriate initiatives to stimulate the owners of land where spontaneous ash reforestation has occurred to harvest this potential resource...|$|R
50|$|On August 1, 2009, a Steam Donkey {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} at McLean Mill National Historic Site in Port Alberni, British Columbia. It {{is now the}} only commercially operating steam donkey in North America. On that occasion, due to extreme fire risk, demonstrations of the donkey were not performed, but the <b>logs</b> <b>hauled</b> by previous test runs of the donkey (and had been loaded onto a truck) were dumped into the McLean Mill millpond, representing the first steam-powered commercial logging operation in North America in decades. This machine continued to operate after R. B. Mclean shuttered the steam-powered McLean Mill site in 1965. It ran until 1972 and was abandoned on site. It was restored by the Alberni Valley Industrial Heritage Society in 1986 for Expo 86 and, more recently, was re-certified for commercial use at McLean Mill. Agreements have been made with forestland owner Island Timberlands (owned by Brookfield Asset Management) to log, mill, and sell trees and lumber from the surroundings of McLean Mill.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{on the effect}} of slopes and load volumes on the productivity of hand lorry was carried out at Padangan Forest District, Unit II Perum Perhutani, East Java, in 1983. In the investigation, four levels of slopes (i. e. 3, 4, 5, and 6 percent), four levels of load volumes (i. e. 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, and 5. 0 m 3) and the crew of 4 workers were used. The objective was to find the productivity of hand lorry opearating on several slopes and with several load volumes. The results reveal that:The productivities of <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> by hand lorry ranged from : 7. 16 to 25. 09 m 3 km/hour with an average of 16. 46 m 3 km/hour. Higher slope and load volume caused the decrease in lorry productivity. The relation of productivity (Y), slope (X 1) and load volume (X 2) can be expressed by the following equation of linear multiple regression: Y = 48. 626 - 2. 199 X 1 - 5. 342 X 2 with R 2 = 0. 58 Slopes and load volumes have highly significant effect on productivities...|$|R
50|$|In Finland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, {{and some}} roads in Norway, trucks with {{trailers}} {{are allowed to}} be 25.25 m long. Elsewhere in the European Union, the limit is 18.75 m (Norway 19.5 m). The trucks are of a cab-over-engine design. These have a flat front and a high floor about 1.2 m above ground with the engine below. The Scandinavian countries are less densely populated than the other EU countries; and distances, especially in Finland and Sweden, are long. Until the late 1960s, vehicle length was unlimited, giving rise to long vehicles to handle goods cost effectively. As traffic increased, lengths became more of a concern and they were limited, albeit at a more generous level than {{in the rest of}} Europe. In the United Kingdom in 2009, a two-year desk study of Longer Heavier Vehicles (LHVs) including options up to 11-axle, 34 m long, 82 t combinations, ruled out all road train type vehicles for the foreseeable future.In 2010, Sweden was performing tests on <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> trucks, weighing up to 90 t and measuring 30 m and haulers for two 40 ft containers, measuring 32 m in total.|$|R

They began their cycling journey on April 1 on the Ice Road that links Tuktoyuktuk on the Arctic Coast with Inuvik at {{the northern end of}} the Dempster Highway thereby making a physical link with their previous canoe voyage. The journey took five months. The route was mapped out to link the three oceans from the Arctic to the Pacific to the Atlantic, to include the Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory and all ten provinces from British Columbia to Newfoundland and, for the most part, the route was on the most northerly roads they could find. Challenges faced included frostbite in the -40-degree weather on the Ice Road, avoiding grizzly bear encounters on the Dempster, enduring severe knee pain on 1500 miles of bone-jarring, unpaved roads, sheltering from hail storms on the prairies, having close encounters with <b>log</b> <b>hauling</b> trucks in British Columbia and northern Ontario, and surviving frigid late autumn weather in Newfoundland off the Strait of Belle Isle.|$|R
