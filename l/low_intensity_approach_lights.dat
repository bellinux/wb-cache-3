40|$|Background: Breaking Free from OCD is a {{cognitive}} behavioural self-help book {{for young people}} with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The book is written for 11 – 16 year olds {{as a first step}} intervention for reducing mild to moderate symptoms of OCD. Aims: This report describes a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the book as a self-help intervention. Method: Using a case-series design, eight 11 – 16 year olds with OCD were monitored for symptom stability 3 weeks prior to receiving Breaking Free from OCD for use over an 8 -week period. Weekly telephone calls were received to complete the CY-BOCS for symptom severity and to monitor adherence to the intervention. The CHOCI and SDQ were sent to participants and their parents pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Results: There was a significant reduction in CY-BOCS symptom severity {{over the course of the}} intervention; however, there were no statistically significant changes on the self-report measures. The intervention was well received by the majority of young people who took part. Conclusions:Breaking Free from OCD may help young people with OCD and is an acceptable <b>low</b> <b>intensity</b> intervention.

At limiting light intensities a linear relation was found in all species. At <b>intensities</b> <b>approaching</b> <b>light</b> saturation, the relation was found to deviate from linearity. The slope of the line in the light-limited range is species dependent and related to differences in absorption cross-section of Photosystem II. The observed non-linearity at high irradiances is not caused by photorespiration but probably by a Mehler-type of oxygen reduction. The relationship could be modelled by including a redox-state dependent oxygen uptake. In the diatom t Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the photochemical efficiency of dark adapted open Photosystem II centers was found to be temperature-dependent with an optimum near 10 °C...|$|R

30|$|Wavelet {{transforms}} (WT) [11] based {{image analysis}} {{is a valuable}} tool for image enhancement since {{it can be used}} to highlight scale-specific or sub-band specific image features. In addition, these features remain localized in space, thus many spatial domain image enhancement techniques can be adapted for the WT domain. The WT domain contrast enhancement algorithms can be divided into manipulating the detail coefficient sets or the approximation coefficient sets that result from WT decomposition. The latter manipulation mainly applies global histogram equalization to the approximation coefficient sets and then adds back the image's small-scale high frequency features. Resulting from the phenomenon that the background gray-level concentrates in <b>low</b> <b>intensity,</b> this <b>approach</b> will degrade the image contrast. In order to enhance the intensity difference around the boundaries of the target, an edge-confined wavelet enhancement filter [10] is applied. To achieve this goal, edge detector is first applied on the image to extract the edges and then the wavelet enhancement is selectively applied on the edges near the target boundaries.|$|R

They commonly interfere with peer relationships, schooling and family life, and persist into adulthood if left untreated. This paper gives an overview of the identification, assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in children and young people. Identification of anxiety disorders is often poor and many young people with anxiety disorders go untreated. We present a brief review of the evidence base for pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches to the management of anxiety disorders in youth.

We previously reported a novel droplet digital-PCR (ddPCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial gene nad 1 to diagnose schistosomiasis japonica.

The assay was validated here using clinical samples collected from 412 subjects resident in an area moderately endemic for schistosomiasis in the Philippines. S. japonicum DNA present in human stool, serum, urine and saliva was detected quantitatively with high sensitivity. The capability to diagnose cases of human schistosomiasis using non-invasively collected clinical samples, the higher level of sensitivity obtained compared with the microscopy-based Kato-Katz test, and the capacity to quantify infection intensity, have important public health implications for schistosomiasis control and programs targeting other neglected tropical diseases.

5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> systems (abbreviated ALS). Most often, {{these are}} at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> system at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b).

Yet there are too few specialists to offer help to everyone, and negative attitudes to psychological problems and their treatment discourage people from seeking it. As a result, many people never receive help for these problems. The Oxford Guide to <b>Low</b> <b>Intensity</b> CBT Interventions marks {{a turning point in the}} delivery of psychological treatments for people with depression and anxiety. Until recently, the only form of psychological intervention available for patients with depression and anxiety was traditional one-to-one 60 minute session therapy - usually with private practitioners for those patients who could afford it. Now <b>Low</b> <b>Intensity</b> CBT Interventions are starting to revolutionize mental health care by providing cost effective psychological therapies which can reach the vast numbers of people with depression and anxiety who did not previously have access to effective psychological treatment. The Oxford Guide to <b>Low</b> <b>Intensity</b> CBT Interventions is the first book to provide a comprehensive guide to <b>Low</b> <b>Intensity</b> CBT interventions. It brings together researchers and clinicians from around the world who have led the way in developing evidence-based <b>low</b> <b>intensity</b> CBT treatments. It charts the plethora of new ways that evidence-based <b>low</b> <b>intensity</b> CBT can be delivered: for instance, guided self-help, groups, advice clinics, brief GP interventions, internet-based or book-based treatment and prevention programs, with supported provided by phone, email, internet, sms or face-to-face. These new treatments require new forms of service delivery, new ways of communicating, new forms of training and supervision, and the development of new workforces. They involve changing systems and routine practice, and adapting interventions to particular community contexts. The Oxford Guide to <b>Low</b> <b>Intensity</b> CBT Interventions is a state-of-the-art handbook, providing <b>low</b> <b>intensity</b> practitioners, supervisors, managers commissioners of services and politicians with a practical, easy-to-read guide - indispensible reading for those who wish to understand and anticipate future directions in health service provision and to broaden access to cost-effective evidence-based psychological therapies.
