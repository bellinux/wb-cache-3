25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|E

6000|$|I {{ran to the}} wash-hand stand; {{drank some}} {{of the water in}} my jug; poured the rest out, and plunged my face into it; then sat down in a chair and tried to compose myself. I soon felt better. The change for my lungs, from the fetid {{atmosphere}} of the gambling-room to the cool air of the apartment I now occupied, the almost equally refreshing change for my eyes, from the glaring gaslights of the [...] "salon" [...] to the dim, quiet flicker of one bedroom-candle, aided wonderfully the restorative effects of cold water. The giddiness left me, and I began to feel a little like a reasonable being again. My first thought was of the risk of sleeping all night in a gambling-house; my second, of the still greater risk of trying to get out after the house was closed, and of going home alone at night through the streets of Paris with a large sum of money about me. I had slept in worse places than this on my travels; so I determined to <b>lock,</b> <b>bolt,</b> and barricade my door, and take my chance till the next morning.|$|E
60|$|Eleven o'clock was {{the family}} hour for going to bed at Baregrove Square. Zack's first {{proceeding}} on entering his room was to open his window softly, put on an old traveling cap, and light a cigar. It was December weather at that time; but his hardy constitution rendered him as impervious to cold as a young Polar bear. Having smoked quietly for half an hour, he listened at his door till the silence in Mr. Thorpe's dressing-room below assured him {{that his father was}} safe in bed, and invited him to descend on tiptoe--with his boots under his arm--into the hall. Here he placed his candle, with a box of matches by it, on a chair, and proceeded to open the house door with the noiseless dexterity of a practiced burglar--being always careful to facilitate the safe performance of this dangerous operation by keeping <b>lock,</b> <b>bolt,</b> and hinges well oiled. Having secured the key, blown out the candle, and noiselessly closed the door behind him, he left the house, and started for the Haymarket, Covent Garden, or the Strand, a little before midnight--or, in other words, set forth on a nocturnal tour of amusement, just at the time when the doors of respectable places of public recreation (which his father prevented him from attending) were all closed, and the doors of disreputable places all thrown open.|$|E
60|$|As a {{neighboring}} church clock was striking nine with an indolence {{which seemed to}} imply such an indifference to the flight of time that one could hardly help wondering why it took the trouble to strike at all, the single door {{of the room was}} opened and a man entered, advancing toward the body. As he did so the door closed, apparently of its own volition; there was a grating, as of a key turned with difficulty, and the snap of the <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> as it shot into its socket. A sound of retiring footsteps in the passage outside ensued, and the man was to all appearance a prisoner. Advancing to the table, he stood a moment looking down at the body; then with a slight shrug of the shoulders walked over to one of the windows and hoisted the blind. The darkness outside was absolute, the panes were covered with dust, but by wiping this away he could see that the window was fortified with strong iron bars crossing it within a few inches of the glass and imbedded in the masonry on each side. He examined the other window. It was the same. He manifested no great curiosity in the matter, did not even so much as raise the sash. If he was a prisoner he was apparently a tractable one. Having completed his examination of the room, he seated himself in the arm-chair, took a book from his pocket, drew the stand with its candle alongside and began to read.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Prevention of slack in {{fastening}} bolt {{has been an}} important researching subject since fatigue failure can be generally caused by loosening nut. According to the above reason, the super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> with double screw mechanism, which is non-loosening, has been developed for preventing such kind of bolt failure. The objects of the present study are as follows: (1) To clarify the fatigue strength characteristics. (2) To investigate the initiation and propagation behaviour of fatigue crack regarding to the thread root of first pitch. In addition, the mechanism of “fatigue strength of super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> ” is also discussed in this paper and it is confirmed that this bolt shows excellent fatigue strength and non-loosening properties...|$|E

40|$|Due to its user-independent {{assembly}} and less deviation in pretension <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> systems {{have a significant}} advantage over conventionale HV-screws. In the industrial environment of an ongoing endeavour to lightweight and the resulting efforts to utilize fiber plastic composites, {{the use of the}} lock bolts is facing different challenges. As part of research project, a vacuum-injection-method is established, which allows a flexible and cost-effective production of test laminates. The quality of the product laminates is evaluated using statistical procedures. Based on the knowledge about design stndards and guideline for screw connections nad for <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, this research, report takes {{on the question of the}} transferability of these design rules onto fiber art material. The basic interest in this context is the carrying capacity of shear force loaded lock bolts connections and the determination of yielding in the laminate thickness direction. For shear force loaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections the possible failures will be listed and the accompannying arithmetical verification presented. Due to the variety of fiber plastic composites, whose selection mainly depends on the type and amount of the load, in this project trial-based assessments are determined and the capacities to withstand certain stresses are investigated. The investigation is focused on the determination of the compliances and the ultimate interface pressure, the shear and bearing stress experiments for the experimental determination of the bearing stress coeddicient as well as the use of the statistic test planning and evaluation in respect to the use of slip-restiant preloaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections. Finally, the experimental determined stress restiance (ultimate surface pressure, ultimate bearing resistance, slip resistance) are compared with the calculated stress resistance and literature values...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield load}} {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is a characteristic joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the yield load equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> and blind rivet joints the yield load equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch rivets / self piercing riveting 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the yield load equivalent. For this kind of joints the yield load equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly. Current research projects at the Fraunhofer AGP - Rostock have the goal of implementing the yield load equivalent in national guidelines and standards for dimensioning of blind rivet and <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> joints...|$|E
