With the emphasis of a modern office being placed on efficiency and ease of communication, <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> have become the backbone of successful businesses. COSNET is a prototype <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system</b> designed and implemented at the Department of the University of Cape Town and runs on Personal Computers that are linked to a NCR UNIX TOWER, which acts as the host. This dissertation investigates the different facilities supported by some of the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> compared in this thesis, and describes the COSNET features. This prototype <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system</b> supports many of the facilities that are supported by large <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems.</b> COSNET allows the user to define any MS-DOS based editor or word processor, and uses a simple editor for the creation of mail. The electronic filing facility allows documents to be created, filed, retrieved and deleted, and thus provides the users with the necessary features for document exchange. A user may set access permissions to each of his documents and may grant other users either read or write access to a specific document. The mail facility lets the user read, file, forward, delete and print a message, and supports classification of mail. A calendar facility is used as an electronic diary and stores all the user's schedules. These schedules may be viewed in either daily, weekly and monthly display modes. Read and write access to the calendar can be set by the user, in order to allow other users to manipulate his schedules. Any MS-DOS based application software can be added to COSNET. This facility allows the COSNET user to configure the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system</b> to simulate the office environment. COSNET thus supports most of the necessary features required by an <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

Innovations and best practices used in <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> during <b>automation</b> {{will improve the}} quality of the services delivered by the organizations to their stakeholders. This paper provides essential management concepts and quality enhancement ideas in office management to develop a foundation for success in transitioning administrative assignments. Best practices are shared that can significantly improve administrators' leadership skills and the possible success in managing students and staff to maintain a productive, positive, and supportive office environment. Best practices through <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> provide another tool that institutions can use to {{improve the quality of}} administration. <b>Office</b> <b>automation</b> is intended to provide elements which support to simplify, improve and automate specified activities of the organization. The implementation of recordkeeping and filing systems should not be too highly stressed. A well-planned <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system</b> contributes significantly to the efficiency of operation as well as to the image of an institution. The <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>system</b> can reduce the work intensity with the help of the network and computer technology as well as the related information resources.

In other words, can we deploy very general, non-customized programs that can be extended and adapted during usage? Besides the well-known knowledge acquisition and automated learning methods we propose an approach called dialog-based learning (DBL), that allows the user to teach the system directly while performing the task. It acquires knowledge through a dialog in which the user both illustrates the procedure using a grounded example, and provides instructions about how to perform the task in the general case. We focus discussion on CAP II (a program that schedules meetings by negotiation via email), and on RAP (a program that makes room reservation via email). 1 Introduction We [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Office</b> <b>automation</b> <b>systems</b> {{are growing}} both in use and in complexity. The {{development}} of a database management <b>system</b> for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment becomes a high priority, {{in order to provide}} an efficient and reliable way to manage the information needs of the office. Therefore, the specification of a database server for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment becomes a key area of concern. In addition to providing traditional database support, the database server must also provide new database support, so as to meet the unique and many needs of <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environments. This paper focuses on the characterization and specification of a database server for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment. It also considers how such a database server can be effectively integrated into the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment. The authors use both intuitive comparisons and queing-theory analyses to evaluate the various integration approaches. Further, they examine an experimental database system, known as the multibackend database system, as a candidate for the database server in the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment.
