5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its <b>loading</b> <b>tray,</b> crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E
25|$|The Mle 1915 was a {{conventional}} design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield {{to protect the}} crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A <b>loading</b> <b>tray</b> was hinged {{to the left side}} of the cradle. It was swung into position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled limber was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the limber. For (slow) motor-traction no limber was necessary and the trail was hooked directly to the tractor.|$|E
500|$|After the British Army {{failed to}} capture Westende, the {{mounting}} was optimised {{for use on}} a monitor. It was very simple, consisting of two large girders connected together at each end with the gun and its carriage between them. The mount could only traverse 10° inside its fixed, ½-inch (12.7mm) gun shield and was aimed over the starboard side of the monitor. It was loaded at a fixed angle of 10°, but it could only fire between 22° and 45° to equalize the stresses on the carriage and the ship. It was provided with hydraulically powered cranes, <b>loading</b> <b>tray,</b> rammer and breech mechanism to minimize the crew's workload, but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power. The shells were stowed below deck {{and had to be}} moved by overhead rail to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded. The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam-heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails, two one-sixth charges at a time, which reduced the rate of fire to about one round about every 3–4 minutes. The monitors had to be extensively modified to handle the gun. Numerous additional structural supports had to be added underneath the gun to support its weight of the sides had to be plated in to accommodate the additional crewmen and the interior rearranged for the 18–inch shells and the loading arrangements.|$|E

[...] It used a Welin interrupted screw breech. The shell was fuzed manually on the <b>loading</b> <b>tray</b> before being rammed by hand and could only be loaded at elevations between 5° and 10°. All mounts used pusher type shell hoists, but the powder bags were passed by hand.|$|E

2500|$|A new {{simpler and}} more compact UMD <b>loading</b> <b>tray</b> design was developed, {{in which the}} tray swivels out instead of opening up completely, while the Wi-Fi switch {{was moved to the}} top of the PSP. To address many {{consumer}} complaints about the Memory Stick door breaking off the old PSP, the Memory Stick door has been relocated and redesigned. The speakers were repositioned on the front of the PSP near the top of its screen. [...] The infra-red port was also removed because it offered no use to the original PSP generation other than in homebrew applications. [...] Its analog stick was also redesigned to be more flexible and is not removable without opening the PSP. The air vent at the top of the original was also removed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structural dynamic modeling of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), {{which is a}} Space Shuttle payload of passive scientific experiments contained in trays mounted on a large cylindrically shaped structure. Special detailed finite element modeling, using the SPAR system of computer programs was required to obtain good agreement between analytical and test vibrations modes. Experimental trays contributed significantly to overall LDEF stiffnesses, and these contributions were realistically represented for each tray by the stiffness matrix of an equivalent orthotropic panel in the overall LDEF SPAR model. Orthotropic stiffnesses for this panel were obtained from finely detailed statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tray</b> SPAR models in which stiffness coupling was accounted for along with partial relative sliding allowed by the tray clamping attachments. Joint boundary conditions were also significant in the structural dynamic modeling of LDEF, and static data proved valuable in assessing modeling of local end fittings...|$|R

50|$|A 52 {{cubic meter}} pit {{had to be}} {{excavated}} to hold the firing platform which took eight to twenty hours, depending on soil conditions. The bedding halves then were winched into position on rails and jacked down into the pit. The carriage was then mounted on the bedding and the barrel mated to it. All this took six to eight hours to prepare for firing. A small tilting crane was mounted {{on the left side}} of the turntable to move shells from their transport carts to the <b>loading</b> <b>tray.</b> It was also used to assemble the <b>loading</b> <b>tray</b> and to change the breech. The howitzer could only be loaded at 11° elevation because the shells had to be rammed by a hand-powered winch with pushrod. The eight later weapons used the same carriage as the 24 cm Kanone M. 16; it had trunnion mounts for both types and the gun used the forward mounts while the howitzer used the rear ones.|$|E
25|$|The French Army {{preferred}} bag {{charges for}} its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases {{used by the}} Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and {{in the amount of}} brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a deBange obdurator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit the barrel of the Mle 1915, but this took quite a bit of time due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their <b>loading</b> <b>trays</b> removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders.|$|R
2500|$|Gunnery {{trials were}} {{conducted}} when Volta {{was on her}} sea trials in mid-1939 and were [...] "an unmitigated disaster" [...] for the reasons given above.

But even these modifications were only stop gaps and an entirely new loading system was deemed necessary, but since this was expected to take 10–12 months to develop the current system would have to be used. Both Volta and Mogador were refitted in January 1940 and had their turrets modified, although loading still could not be done at angles higher than 10°. The surrender of France in June 1940 ended any work on a new loading system. Five-round ready racks for each gun were added to the sides of the turrets during the refit to compensate for any problems with the loading systems.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{bulkiness}} of the ammunition, only 14 rounds {{could be}} carried, of {{which one was}} already loaded, with another in the <b>loading</b> <b>tray.</b> The rest were carried in two storage racks.
