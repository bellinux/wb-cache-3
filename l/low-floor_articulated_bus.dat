50|$|The first {{generation}} Solaris Urbino 18 was produced {{from the second}} half of 1999. This model was to supplement Solaris' offer on large buses, 18-metre buses for public transportation services. The first Solaris Urbino 18 bus unit went to PKA Gdynia in 1999, it was also the only new <b>low-floor</b> <b>articulated</b> <b>bus</b> bought in 1999 by transport companies in Poland. Initially, the 18-metre buses did not sell well because the transportation companies preferred smaller and cheaper 15-metre vehicles. The bus market expanded between 1996-2002, which resulted in the later increase in demand for 18-metre buses. In total, cities in Poland bought 12 units of the Solaris Urbino 18 First Generation. Articulated vehicles were mainly built for export, most Solaris Urbino 18 were bought by a company from Berlin and Riga. A characteristic feature of the bus are the painted railings instead of clear varnish yellow paint.|$|E

Also in 2006 the Tourismo was redeveloped, and a 14-metre version was presented. Amongst the innovations incorporated to the new Tourismo are the new engine output available (354 hp/408 hp/428 hp) and the new-generation transmissions available with EPS system.|$|R
40|$|Wheeled {{mobility}} {{devices that}} are not secured properly on large transit vehicles pose risks to all passengers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to increase the understanding of the effects of horizontal and vertical curves, speed, and driver behavior on the safety and security of people using wheeled mobility devices in rear-facing passive containment systems on large transit buses. Testing included the use of manual wheelchairs and lightweight scooters on an <b>articulated</b> <b>low-floor</b> transit <b>bus.</b> The project conclusions were derived from data produced by accelerometers placed on the bus as well as visual observations of wheeled mobility device movement. The data showed a clear difference in the amount of movement of the wheeled mobility devices and the comfort of the seated passenger when the bus traveled on a combination of horizontal and vertical curves at different driving speeds...|$|R

50|$|Ioannis Saracakis {{started his}} company in Thessaloniki in 1923 {{importing}} and selling vehicles and vehicle parts. In 1941 headquarters {{were moved to}} Athens, where the Group was formally created in 1954. Production of bus bodies on imported chassis started in 1962, but in 1966 the company introduced its own-developed chassis with Volvo engines. From then on, all Saracakis' own chassis types had designations starting with 'SB' (standing for 'Saracakis Brothers') the first being the SB55 line, on which a variety of city and inter-city buses were developed, followed by SB556, SB85 and SB95. Its first chassisless bus type was the SBAV of 1974, a type improved over the years up to the innovative SBAV90 of 1990. Exports were also made, mainly to the Middle East. In addition to building complete vehicles (which included light three-wheeler trucks), the company remained a major bus and truck body builder, also assembling 4x4's, tractors, motorbikes, construction equipment, etc. Its best known bus bodies on Volvo chassis were the articulated models for Athens and Thessaloniki (the company boasts the world's first <b>low-floor</b> <b>articulated</b> <b>bus).</b>|$|E
