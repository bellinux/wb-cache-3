5000|$|.....The Red Mountain ores {{are known}} as a red fossil ore, because {{originally}} the iron accumulated in extensive beds of fragments of fossils, principally the hard parts of crinoids, bryozoans, and brachiopods. The iron, from solution in some form, was precipitated upon and within these beds of fossil fragments and thus the ore beds are simply {{a particular kind of}} sedimentary layers inclosed in ordinary sediments, shales, and sandstones, composing the bulk of the Red Mountain formation. As the fossil fragments were composed of calcium carbonate, which is the mineral that forms limestone, the iron ore beds at depth, where they are unweathered and where there has been no condition that permitted leaching of the lime content, carry a considerable percentage of lime, so that the ore is self-fluxing. Another type of ore is oolite ore, in which the iron oxide occurs in the form of small [...] pellets. The precipitation of the iron that forms this ore started around some minute particle like a small grain of sand or fragment of fossil and built up a small <b>lenticular</b> <b>body.</b> The two kinds of ore are more or less mixed or one or the other may predominate in a particular layer of ore. - Geology of Alabama (1926) ...|$|E

Their mineral assemblages, structures and significant enrichment of Ca, Al and Fe were previously interpreted to be primary (exhalation sediment) or secondary (metasomatic carbonates). In this project, which consists of three sub-studies will focus on the geochemical composition of skarn as the main arguments for the discussion of their origin.

40|$|This is {{the third}} {{of a series of}} papers in which the {{structure}} and kinematics of disk galaxies is studied. By employing direct tilted-ring fits to the data cube as introduced in Paper I, we analyzed the "Spindle" galaxy NGC 2685, previously regarded as a two-ringed polar ring galaxy. Deep HI and optical (i'-band) observations are presented. The HI observations strongly suggest that the gaseous structure of NGC 2685 does not consist of two separate mutually inclined regions, but forms a coherent, extremely warped disk, the appearance of two rings being due to projection effects. By comparing the HI total-intensity maps with the optical image, we demonstrate that at large radii a faint stellar disk is well aligned with the outer HI disk. The shape of the dust lanes obscuring the NE part of the inner stellar body indicates that, also at smaller radii, NGC 2685 possesses a disk containing gas, dust, and stars in which the various constituents are aligned. At smaller radii, this disk is kinematically decoupled from the central stellar body; hence, in the region of the bright, central stellar body, NGC 2685 appears to consist of two disks that share a common center, but have different orientation: a bright stellar <b>lenticular</b> <b>body</b> apparently devoid of dust and gas, and a heavily warped low-surface brightness disk containing stars, gas, and dust. The low-surface-brightness disk changes its orientation gradually and at large radii assumes the orientation of the central stellar S 0 disk. Since, according to our analysis, the intrinsic orientation of the low-surface-brightness disk changes through 70 degrees, the gaseous disk is coherent, and is at no radius oriented perpendicularly with respect to the central stellar body, NGC 2685 {{is not likely to be}} a classical polar-ring galaxy...|$|E

The complex consists of a central <b>lenticular</b> <b>body,</b> up to 700 m thick, of olivine adcumulates, flanked by laterally extensive sheet-like bodies of olivine orthocumulates and spinifex-textured komatiite flows. Rocks progressively further away from the central lens have chemical compositions reflecting higher original proportions of komatiite liquid to cumulus olivine. Parent liquids had MgO contents between 25 and 32 % MgO, approximately chondritic Al/Ti ratios and HREE patterns, and moderate depletion in LREE. Olivines within the adcumulate lens show a progressive increase in forsterite content from Fo 93 at the bottom to Fo 94 [...] 5 at the top. Calculated original olivine compositions in ihe flanking rocks {{are similar to those}} {{at the base of the}} central lens. Original olivine nickel contents show a symmetrical variation from maximum values of 3500 ppm at the top of the central lens, through minimum values of 1000 ppm at the base and margins of the central lens to intermediate values in the distal rocks. The complex as a whole shows evidence for nickel depletion relative to other komatiite suites. These observations are explained in terms of prolonged eruption and flow of komatiitic lava down a major flow channel or lava river. Adcumulates crystallized on the floor and sides of the central channel, which was formed at an early stage by thermal erosion of floor rocks. Episodic overflow of the central channel produced distal 'flood plain ' rocks consisting of olivine orthocumulates and layered flows. Lavas became more magnesian and nickel-rich with time, giving rise to the observed spatial variation in primary olivine composition. Nickel depletion of the earliest lavas is attributed to pre-eruption segregation of large volumes of immiscible Fe-Ni-sulfide, which were concentrated to form the underlying Agnew nickel deposit...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the geology in the Idani district, Shimizu-machi, Aritagun, Wakayama Prefecture, Southwest Japan, since 1968. Recently we found several fusulinids in this district, so that we certify the {{existence}} of the Palaeozoic formations. In this paper we intend to report these fusulinids and discuss the geologic significance of the Palaeozoic formations. The geology in this district was investigated and reported by HIRAYAMA and TANAKA in 1955, and the formation that distributes in this district was named the Idani formation by them. They reported Thamnasteria sp., Stromatopora japonica and others from the limestones, so they have decided that the Idani formation is referable to the Upper Jurassic. This formation mainly consists of black mudstone, with subordinate sandstone, chert and limestone. The strike of the formation is generally ENE-WSW and it inclines to the north. According to them, the Idani formation is overturned to the north and overlies conformably the Yukawa formation which occupies the area to the south of the Idani formation and is referable to the Upper Cretaceous. The northern border of the formation is in contact with the Futagawa formation (Upper Cretaceous in fault. Along the fault a small mass of serpentine is observed, so that they explained the fault as the Butsuzo tectonic line. From the data above mentioned, they considered that the Idani formation might be equivalent to the Nishikawa formation in Shikoku and the Yura formation {{in the western part of}} Wakayama Prefecture in the Shimanto terrain. KATTO (1965) supposed that the south limit of the Idani formation was cut with fault and considered it to be the Butsuzo tectonic line, so he maintained that the Idani formation should be a member of the Chichibu terrain. According to NAKAZAWA (1970), the Yukawa formation which occupies the area to the south of this district has a monoclinic structure as a whole dipping north-ward and the sedimentary top of the formation looks northward; the above fact proves the formation to be in normal order. He guessed that the Idani formation and the Yukawa formation were in fault contact with each other, and, as KATTO previously supposed, he also considered the fault to be the Butsuzo tectonic line and the Idani formation to belong to the Chichibu terrain. In 1968, the fault which exists betweeen the Idani and Futagawa formations has been named the Shimizu-Itao fault by SAKA. Along this fault, SAKA and IMAI (1970) discovered a small mass of granodiorite which is remarkably crushed and partly mylonitized. According to them, this granodiorite is notably similar to that of Nabae Peninsula, Yuasa-machi, Arita-gun, Wakayama Prefecture and moreover resembles the Mitaki igneous rocks discovered in the Kurosegawa zone in Shikoku (Ichikawa et al., 1956). Consequently, they considered that the granodiorite of this district might be identified with the Mitaki Igneous rocks. As for the palaeontological study of the Idani formation, NOHDA and SETOGUCHI (1967) described several Torinosu pelecypods such as Myophorella cfr. obsoleta, Grammatodon takiensis, Entolium yatsujiensis and others from mudstone near the starting point of the Murokawa Forest road in Idani, and two conodonts such as Gladigondolella abneptis and Hindeodella sp. from a crystalline limestone exposed along the Murokawa Forest road in Idani. They considered that these fossils are proofs that the formation was generated an Upper Jurassic age. Recently KOIKE et al. (1970), however, expressed that these conodonts might be compared with the Triassic. In this study, we discovered fusulinids from the north bank of the Arita River (Locality 1) and the Takora Valley (Locality 2). These localities are situated in the southwestern part of this district. Locality 1 : On the north bank of the Arita River, the formation yielding the fusulinids consists of mudstone, sandstone and schalstein, with subordinate limestone and chert. This formation and the Mesozoic formation to the north are in fault with fractured zone; the latter one includes several Torinosu lime-stone lenses yielding stromatoporoids. Though the south boundary is obscure due to the Arita River, we found the Torinosu limestones yielding stromatoporoids and Hexacorals on the opposite bank of the Arita River. The Mesozoic formation bearing these limestones corresponds to the southwestern extension of the mudstone yielding the Torinosu pelecypods described by NOHDA and SETOGUCHI (1967). Therefore, we guess that the present formation and the Mesozoic formation are probably in fault contact. The strike of the formation is generally ENE-WSW and it inclines to the north; however, it is remarkably disturbed. The thickness of this formation is about 80 m. We considered that the formation was squeezed out tectonically as a <b>lenticular</b> <b>body</b> along the fault within the Mosozoic. The following fusulinids and minor foraminifera are found from a small limestone lens in this formation. Lepidolina multiseptata gigantea L. multiseptata shiraiwensis Yabeina sp. indet. Chusenella sp. indet. Pachyphloia sp. indet. The faunal assemblage of the above mentioned fossils is very similar to that known from the Kuma formation in Kyushu. (KANMERA, 1954), the Maizuru group in Kinki (NOGAMI, 1958) and the Toba group in Shima (YAMAGIWA and SAKA, in printing), so that the age of this formation is undoubtedly in the Upper Permian. Locality 2 : In the Takora Valley, the northern border of the formation yielding fusulinids is in contact with th Mesozoic formation including the Torinosu pelecypods described by NOHDA and SETOGUCHI (1967) in fault. The southern border is cut by a fault and comes into contact with the Mesozoic formation containing conodonts, stromatoporoids and Hexacorals reported by HIRAYAMA and TANAKA (1955), and NOHDA and SEOGUCHI (1967). This formation is composed of sandstone and mudstone with limestone, chert and schalstein. We discovered two fusulinids such as Schwagerina cfr. etoi and Triticites aff. plummeri from a small limestone lens attending schalstein of this formation. By the above mentioned fossils, its age belongs to the Lower Permian. The strike of the formation is generally ENE-WSW. It inclines to the north. The thickness is about 50 m. In this study, there are found not only the Mesozoic but also the Palaeozoic formations in this district. Therefore, we guess that the geological members consist of a composite formation including the Palaeozoic and the Mesozoic (Jurassic and Triassic?). Through the survey, we discovered that the southern border of this composite formation was in contact with the Yukawa formation in the Shimanto terrain in fault. From the above geological data these two conclusions are arrived at: (1) this fault correponds to the Butsuzo tectonic line and (2) this composite formation belongs to the Chichibu terrain. As above mentioned, SAKA and IMAI (1970) discovered a small mass of granodiorite along the Shimizu-Itao fault which exist between the composite formation and the Futagawa formation. It is very interesting that the lithologic character of this granodiorite is notably similar to a member of the Mitaki igneous rocks discovered from the Kurosegawa zone in Shikoku (ICHIKAWA et al., 1956) ...|$|E

Similar structures have observed in nearly all the outcrops of the Argille Scagliose between the Reno and Sellustra Valleys, in several {{of which they are}} impressively exposed. The following are the most important observed meso-structures: — Slip planes. These structures affect the Argille Scagliose clayey matrix and develop an intense tectonic lamination. The slip-plane surfaces show striae, mechanical steps, grooves and other slip structures typical of faults in clayey rocks. — <b>Lenticular</b> <b>bodies.</b> There are clayey, marly and sandy bodies included in the Argille Scagliose matrix. They represent residual parts of previously more tabular and continuous lithozones which underwent strong flattening processes accompanied by boudinage. The strain behaviour of the various lithological types are very different. The more competent <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> display brittle systems of deformation. The observed brittle structures indicate that boudinage is the result of an extensive-flattening produced by simple shear. — Folding. Isoclinal, asymmetric and disarmonic folds have plastically deformed the slip planes. The folded zones are enclosed between unfolded levels. Two genetical interpretations are proposed based on drag mechanism and/or on pseudo-diapiric lateral injection. Owing to the presence of these structures the Argille Scagliose in the studied area may be considered as a «tectonic mélange» originated by a very pervasive deformation. This deformation is related to simple shear and pure shear stresses acting on brittle and/or visco-plastic materials. The observed structures can be mainly related to the neogenic polyphased tectonics which originated the thrust system recognized underneath the Ligurian units and across the Apennine border by subsurface geological data and reconstruction produced by AGIP...|$|R

40|$|The {{outcrops}} of Scala Dei (Colombo, 7 980) and Guadalope-Matarraña (Cabrera, 1983) alluvial {{systems are}} located in the SE sector of the Ebro basin. These alluvial systems were developed during the Palaeogene between the mountain front of the Iberian Chain-Catalan Coastal Ranges, and the Los Monegros (Cabrera, 7983) lacustrine system. The proximal alluvial materials correspond to thick conglomeratic levels with different geometries showing diverse types of progressive unconformities (Colombo and Vergés, 1992). The distal materials interfingered with lacustrine deposits correspond mainly to ochre and reddish lutites intercalated with some small tabular or <b>lenticular</b> sandstone rock <b>bodies.</b> The intermediate deposits are characterized by large amounts of sandy rock bodies, with symmetric or asymmetric transverse geometries, placed between tabular lutites and sandstone flat layers. Their geometries are lenticular and well differentiated with respect to their wings of lateral expansion which are infrequent. The planimetry of these <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> shows more or less straight segments separated by bends with a low curvature radius. Their mean sinuosity is low, although on rare occasions it is possible to find some bodies with a high sinuosity. The real meandering geometry is very uncommon. The study of several of these sandy bodies and their lateral edges allows us to define two basic architectural units.

However, {{the number of}} observations of sedimentary structures formed by supercritical flow bedforms remains limited. The low number of observations might be caused by poor constrains on criteria to recognise these associated deposits. This study provides a detailed quantification on the mechanics of a fluvial cyclic step system, and their depositional signature. A computational fluid-dynamics model is employed to acquire a depth-resolved image of a cyclic step system. New insights into the mechanics of cyclic steps shows that: (i) the hydraulic jump is, in itself, erosional; (ii) there are periods over which the flow is supercritical throughout {{and there is no}} hydraulic jump, which plays {{a significant role in the}} morphodynamic behaviour of cyclic steps; and (iii) that the depositional signature of cyclic steps varies with rate of aggradation. Previous work has shown that strongly aggradational cyclic steps, where most of the deposited sediment is not reworked, create packages of backsets, bound upstream and downstream by erosive surfaces. Here the modelling work is focussed on less aggradational conditions and more transportational systems. The depositional signature in such systems is dominated by an amalgamation of concave-up erosional surfaces and low-angle foresets and backsets creating <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies.</b> The difference between highly aggradational cyclic steps and low aggradation steps can be visible in outcrop both by the amount of erosional surfaces, as well as the ratio of foreset to backset, with backsets being indicative of more aggradation...|$|R

An 8 meter-thick, delta-plain succession temporarily accessible in the subaerial delta plain was sub-divided into four units (A to D), which constitute a shallowing upwards sequence recording sedimentation from shoreface at the bottom (Unit A) to lacustrine settings at the top (Unit D). Unit B basically comprises gravelly, coarse-grained sandy <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> (up to 20 m wide, up to a few decimetres thick), within a homogenous, medium-grained sandy background, interpreted as prograding foreshore bars. 3 D facies models, built by using the sequential conditional indicator simulation method, reproduced the sedimentary heterogeneities identified in Unit B, using as input data the sedimentary body geometry and its correlation with sandstone grain size values, with the grain size modes taken as a continuous, quantitative proxy for facies distribution. The simulations not only reproduced satisfactorily the significant sedimentary heterogeneities generated by the facies arrangement, but also predicted and described the spatial relation and the three-dimensional shape of sedimentary bodies accurately. Quality of the models should be ensured by a consistent prior analysis of the spatial structure of the grain size mode based on semivariogram models. Llobregat delta. Physical properties.

40|$|High-pressure (HP) mafic granulites {{are widely}} {{distributed}} as sheet-like and <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> within highly deformed tonalitic gneisses in the Sanggan area, North China Craton. They have clockwise isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling P-T paths implying continental collision tectonics. Whole-rock analyses of 15 samples define a Sm-Nd isochron yielding {{an age of}} 2547 ± 87 Ma with ε Nd(t) = 2. 7. Corresponding Nd depleted mantle model ages show a similar range and are interpreted as {{the age of the}} magmatic protolith to the high-pressure granulites. A combined Sm-Nd mineral+whole-rock isochron from one of these samples yields an age of 1813 ± 23 Ma, taken to represent the metamorphic age at an early stage on the cooling path. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon analyses of three HP mafic granulite samples give uniform weighted mean 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages of 1817 ± 12, 1817 ± 12 and 1819 ± 16 Ma. These ages are interpreted to date metamorphism of the HP granulites and, with the Sm-Nd mineral + whole-rock result, strongly suggest that the time of continental collision was at ca. 1. 82 Ga. An additional sample records two age populations; one at 1803 ± 9 Ma and an older one at 1872 ± 16 Ma. The latter may indicate the timing of either an earlier metamorphic event or possibly the earliest stage of a single prolonged metamorphic episode that peaked at ∼ 1. 82 Ga.

The levator palpebrae superioris’ action is sent through the oculomotor nerve.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the structures and metamorphic petrology of an area of Eocambrian rocks in Soroy, Northern Norway, forms {{the basis of this}} dissertation. The area is characterised by metasediments some of which enclose sheared <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> of metagabbro. Gneisses have been developed as products of granitisation. The stratigraphical order of the metasedimentary succession can be demonstrated by reference to sedimentary structures preserved in massive psammites. From this evidence, it is manifest that strata are Inverted over a large part of N. E. Sry, this inversion being attributed to the presence of early recumbent folds of considerable magnitude. In the surveyed area, major folds of a later, second deformation episode dominate the structural picture and refold the early structures. The second episode of folding was protracted and consists of two distinct phases. The main folding occurred early in this period while the later phase is characterised by a brittle deformation. Generally, second episode folds display monoclinic symmetry though in the south and west there is no uni-directional sense of fold overturning and the symmetry of movement is apparently orthorhombic. This difference of fold symmetry is clearly related to an orthogonal swing of strike direction. Textural studies of the metasediments in relation to the tectonic episodes allow a subdivision of the metamorphic history into a number of phases. A low grade metamorphism accompanied the early folding. The highest grade of regional metamorphism was established late in the static Interval separating the first and second deformation episodes. Coeval with this, a granitisation of the metasediments was effected which continued, in part, into the second episode of folding. Diaphthoretic phenomena characterise the later phase of brittle deformation. <p...|$|R
40|$|In the Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux quarry (Armorican Hercynian belt, western France), an {{epigenetic}} {{hydrothermal alteration}} affects an oolitic ironstone layer intercalated within the Lower Ordovician Grès armoricain Formation. The hydrothermal overprint produced pervasive and massive sulphidation with stratoid pyritized <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> within the oolitic ironstone layer. These sulphide lenses are spatially associated with strike-slip faults and extend laterally from them. Following the massive sulphidation stage (Fe-As, stage 1), subsequent fracturing allowed the deposition of base metals (stage 2) and Pb-Sb-Au (stage 3) parageneses in veins. The dominant brittle structures are vertical extension veins, conjugate shear veins and strike-slip faults of various orders. All these structures {{are filled with}} the same paragenetic sequence. Deformation analysis allows the identification of structures that developed incrementally via right lateral simple shear compatible with bulk strain affecting the Central Armorican Domain. Each increment corresponds to a fracture set filled with specific parageneses. Successive hydrothermal pulses reflect clockwise rotation of the horizontal shortening direction. Geothermometry on chlorite and arsenopyrite shows an input of hot hydrothermal fluids (maximum of 390 - 350 °C) during the main sulphide stage 1. The subsequent stages present a marked temperature drop (300 - 275 °C). Lead isotopes suggest that the lead source is similar for all hydrothermal stages and corresponds to the underlying Neo-proterozoic basement. Lead isotope data, relative ages of deformation and comparison with neighbouring deposits suggest large-scale fluid pulses occurred during the whole Hercynian orogeny rather than pulses restricted to the late Hercynian period. The vicinity of the Hercynian internal domain appears as a key-control for deformation and fluid flow in the oolitic ironstones which acted as a chemical and structural trap for the hydrothermal fluids. The epigenetic mineralization of Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux appears to be very similar to epigenetic sulphidation described in BIF-hosted gold deposits...|$|R

In the Polar Urals, the metasomatites occur as <b>lenticular</b> and tube-like <b>bodies</b> in the fault zones of the Cambrian basement within the Kharbey block.

40|$|The Mundão anatectic {{complex is}} located in the axial zone of the Iberian massif of Central Northern Portugal (Central Iberian Zone). It {{consists}} of <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies</b> of felsic gneisses and stromatic metatexites derived from metasedimentary protoliths of Neoproterozoic-Lower Cambrian age, both showing evidence of incipient to extensive partial melting during the Variscan orogeny. Although the precise age of the migmatization event is still unknown, field and structural evidence show that the partial melting conditions were reached in the last stages of crustal thickening (D 1), continued during subsequent extensional deformation (D 2) and culminated with the emplacement of large volumes of S-type granite magmas in a transcurrent tectonic regime (D 3). The upper limit for crustal melting is provided by the Late Carboniferous age of the S-type granitoids (312. 4 2. 7 Ma) intruding the Mundão anatectic complex. Due to their transitional contacts with the stromatic metatexites, the felsic gneisses were previously interpreted as diatexites resulting from anatexis of the same pelitic and/or metagreywacke protolith. However, new U–Pb dating by ID-TIMS show that the zircon fractions from one sample of the leucocratic gneisses are concordant and yield a 206 Pb/ 238 U weighted average age of 474. 5 1. 5 Ma. The results obtained reveal that these rocks correspond to orthogneisses instead of sedimentary-derived diatexites and provide a good estimate for the crystallization age of their magmatic protolith. In contrast, the monazite fractions show distinct 207 Pb/ 235 U ages of 341. 8 2. 1 Ma and 453. 4 2. 0 Ma and may therefore have lost Pb to different extent during Variscan deformation and metamorphism. The preservation of inherited ages of the igneous protolith in the Mundão leucocratic gneisses suggests that zircon was mainly incorporated as restitic material, with only minor precipitation and/or recrystallization during crustal anatexis. The new age of the Mundão orthogneiss brackets the so-called Early Ordovician Sardic unconformity, characteristic of the Central Iberian Zone...|$|R
40|$|The Bepkong {{gold deposit}} {{is one of}} several gold camps in the Paleoproterozoic Wa-Lawra greenstone belt in {{northwest}} Ghana. These deposits lay along the Kunche-Atikpi shear zone, {{which is part of the}} larger transcurrent Jirapa shear zone. The formation of these shear zones can be attributed to the general ESE-WNW major shortening that took place in the Wa-Lawra belt. Gold mineralization in the Bepkong deposit mainly occurs within graphitic shales and volcaniclastic rocks. The ore consists of four N-S trending <b>lenticular</b> <b>bodies,</b> plunging steeply to the south, that are lithologically and structurally controlled. Their shape and thickness are variable, though a general strike length of 560 m and an overall thickness of 300 m can be defined. An alteration mineral assemblage characterises the ore, and consists of chloritecalcite-sericite-quartz-arsenopyrite-pyrite. Pyrite, as distinct from arsenopyrite, is not limited to the altered rocks and occurs throughout the area. At Bepkong, gold is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite, which occur disseminated in the mineralized wall rock, flanking Type- 1 quartz veins, or within fractures crossing these veins. Textural observations indicate the early formation of abundant arsenopyrite, followed by pyrite, with chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrrhotite occurring as inclusions within pyrite and altered arsenopyrite. Detailed petrography, coupled with SEM, LA-ICP-MS and EMP analyses, indicate that gold in the Bepkong deposit occurs in three distinct forms: (i) invisible gold, mostly in arsenopyrite (ii); visible gold as micron-size grains within fractures and altered rims of arsenopyrite, as well as at the interface of sulphide grains; (iii) free visible gold in fractures in quartz veins and their selvages. We interpret the invisible gold to have co-precipitated with the early-formed arsenopyrite. The small visible gold grains observed within the sulphide interfaces, altered arsenopyrite, fractures and grain boundaries, are interpreted to have formed as a result of the dissolution and redistribution of the invisible gold during later alteration of arsenopyrite, which took place at lower temperatures during crenulation and fracturing accompanying late deformation, and was accompanied by pervasive pyritization of the wall rock...|$|R
