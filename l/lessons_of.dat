5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophers}} chose a {{short history}} of scientific predecessors– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day.

5|$|On 12 December 2008, the Icelandic {{parliament}} {{established a}} Special Investigation Commission (SIC), {{which came to}} consist of Supreme Court Justice Páll Hreinsson who served as chairman, Parliamentary Ombudsman Tryggvi Gunnarsson and Sigríður Benediktsdóttir associate chair at Yale University, to investigate the causes and <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the crisis.

5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel.

5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors {{to absorb the}} <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.|$|E

He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the campaign in Greece.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911. Shortly after completion she ran aground off the Romanian port of Constanţa in October 1911, but was only slightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population.

5|$|The British Army {{tried to}} learn the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the First World War, and adopt them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, {{and much of the}} 1930s, the General Staff tried to {{establish}} a small, mechanised, professional army and formed the Experimental Mechanized Force but, with the lack of any identified threat, its main function reverted to garrison duties around the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to codify, {{preserve}} and pass on the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> warfare at land and sea from past experience, {{through the use of}} military manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that {{is a combination of}} various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the Battle of the Somme and could mount set-piece attacks against fortified field defences. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector then returned to the stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E

5|$|As the Japanese on Los Negros {{ran out of}} {{food and}} ammunition, the fight became {{increasingly}} unequal. A last stand by fifty Japanese in the Papitalai Hills on 24March {{marked the end of}} organised Japanese resistance on Los Negros. The end of organised resistance on Los Negros and Manus still left a number of islands in Japanese hands. To minimise civilian casualties, ANGAU quietly evacuated these islands in advance of the American operations. Pityilu was believed occupied by about 60Japanese. On 30 March the 1stSquadron, 7thCavalry was transported there from Lorengau by 10LCMs towing seven LVTs. With the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Hauwei in mind, the landing was covered by bombardment by destroyers, artillery, and two Landing Craft Support, plus an air strike by Kittyhawks and Spitfires. The landing was unopposed, but a strong Japanese position was encountered which was overcome with the aid of artillery and tanks. Some 59Japanese were killed compared with eight Americans killed and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 13 May 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> the Russo-Japanese War. For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, a major {{lesson for}} the Greeks was the {{potential}} of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious. Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how devastating the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon. The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military <b>lessons</b> <b>of</b> Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.|$|E
