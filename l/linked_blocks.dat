50|$|The Van Alen Building {{consists}} of three <b>linked</b> <b>blocks</b> of equal width, of which the westernmost is recessed significantly from Marine Parade. The centre bay is set further forwards but still recessed, and the easternmost (corner) bay fronts the road. Curved lines and surfaces are used throughout; the building thereby represents a 21st-century interpretation of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne styles which were popular themes in seaside resort architecture in the 1930s. In Brighton, this tradition was represented by the Embassy Court development of 1934-36 by Modernist architect Wells Coates—one of the city's most innovative and iconic modern buildings—and the Van Alen Building {{has been compared to}} it. The overall design has been praised as innovative by Brighton & Hove City Council and within the building industry. Local conservationists have also given their approval.|$|E
5000|$|Eastney Barracks, {{designed}} by William Scamp (assistant director, Admiralty Works Department), was built as {{headquarters for the}} Royal Marine Artillery, who moved in from Fort Cumberland in 1867. After the amalgamation of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and Royal Marine Artillery in 1923, Forton Barracks was closed and Eastney Barracks served as headquarters for the Portsmouth Division of the Corps. The series of seven <b>linked</b> <b>blocks</b> facing the sea forms the second longest barracks frontage in the country (after the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich). The ensemble has been called [...] "the best and most complete barracks of the post-Crimean War period". Eastney Barracks remained the Corps Headquarters until 1995, when it was sold and converted to private housing. The Royal Marines Museum, established there in 1958, is accommodated in the former officers' mess at Eastney Barracks.|$|E

The Health Campus scheme collapsed in 2005 and in February 2006 the Paddington Development Corporation - now European Land and Property Ltd - submitted a new planning application. Branded as Merchant Square, this proposed 1800000 sq ft of mixed-use space spanning 6 buildings, including 554 residential units and 58% commercial space. Planning permission was granted on 1 March 2007. A revised planning application was subsequently submitted and was approved on 19 May 2011. 4 Merchant Square, a 16-storey block of 196 flats, designed by Tryfon Kalyvides Partnership, is now complete; 5 Merchant Square (formerly Carmine) is a 14-storey office block of 255000 sq ft designed by mossessian & partners and part-occupied by Marks & Spencer, which also occupies the Waterside Building.|$|E

The return crank attached to the eccentric rod, which hung from a pivot close {{to the far end}} of the eccentric rod. This pivot attached to the end of the radius hanger, the other end of which attached to a <b>link</b> <b>block</b> which slid back and forth in a track curved in the same manner as the expansion link of a Walschaerts gear.

A single component organic solar cell (SCOSC) fabricated from BDTRh-PCBM exhibits the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2. 44 % and maximum external quantum efficiency of 46 %, which are the highest among the reported efficiencies so far. The SCOSC device shows efficient charge transfer (CT, approximate to 300 fs) and smaller CT energy loss, resulting in the higher open-circuit voltage of 0. 97 V, compared to the binary blend (BDTRh:PCBM). Because of {{the integration of the}} donor and acceptor in a single molecule, BDTRh-PCBM has a specific D-A arrangement with less energetic disorder and reorganization energy than blend systems. In addition, the SCOSC device shows excellent device and morphological stabilities, showing no degradation of PCE at 80 degrees C for 100 h. The SCOSC approach may suggest a great way to suppress the large phase segregation of donor and acceptor domains with better morphological stability compared to the blend device...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{changes in the}} explanatory style of university students can lead to conditions that can enhance creative thinking. Seligman’s theory of explanatory style optimism {{has been associated with}} increased feelings of well-being, academic success, popularity, and creative problem-solving. In contrast his theory of pessimism has been associated with depression, low achievements, poor social skills, and lack of creativity. Other theorists have <b>linked</b> <b>blocks</b> for creativity to attitudes of failure avoidance, past experiences of failure, repeated stress, extrinsic motivation, lack of enjoyment, and reactive attitudes. Qualitative analyses using Nvivo 7 was made of the comments of 50 students who completed the nine week programme “Get optimistic about study”. The programme was presented using innovative and creative methodology. Data taken at pre-programme and post-programme intervals showed themes that suggest enhanced creativity in post-programme comments. Further quantitative analysis of the data is recommended to investigate how changes in creativity may have influenced the academic results of participants.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing biomedical research since the sequencing of the human genome has been to understand the role of genetic variation in human disease. Many genetic variants have been associated with common diseases. However, determining the functional consequences of these variants has been hard. Several variants are often inherited together in tightly <b>linked</b> <b>blocks,</b> making it difficult to determine the causative variant. People have millions of other genetic differences, making it difficult to correlate cellular phenotypes with a particular variant. Different gene sets are expressed in different cells, {{but it is difficult to}} extract disease-relevant cells from large numbers of patients. We describe a method with the potential to revolutionize the functional analysis of genetic variation, using custom nucleases to genetically modify individual variants in induced pluripotent stem cells. This process would provide unprecedented analytical power, present the first general method to determine if a variant is causative, and analyze function disease-relevant cell types. We will focus on variants at the 9 p 21 region of the genome that have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The methods should provide a new way to unlock the wealth of data from genome-wide association studies, and to probe the genetic architecture of common diseases. We will describe our improved methods for inexpensive and rapid construction of highly active zinc finger and TALE nucleases to examine the functional role of polymorphisms at the 9 p 21 CAD risk locus...|$|E

Herein we report the detailed synthesis and characterizations of two hybrid coil-coil diblock copolymers along with two hybrid rodcoil diblock copolymers through polymerization-hybridization approach. The coil-coil diblocks were synthesized via atom transfer radial polymerization (ATRP) of styryl-type monomers and 4 -vinylpyridine in sequence. For rod-coil diblock copolymers, the coil block was synthesized through ATRP, followed by the conversion of the terminal bromide to an azide. Ethynyl terminated poly (p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and poly (3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) were prepared separately as the rod blocks. The rod block and the coil block were connected through click chemistry to yield rod-coil diblock copolymers. After removing the phthalimide protecting groups to regenerate aryl amines, POM clusters were finally linked to the coil block of all diblock copolymers to yield the targeted hybrid diblock copolymers. The covalent cluster attachment was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR and cyclovoltammetry measurements. The structures, solution and film optical properties, self-assembled morphologies and solar cell performances of these hybrids have been studied. It has been found that solar cell devices based on hybrid P 3 HT exhibited rather poor performances. Fluorescence dynamic studies indicate that the photoinduced electron transfer process from the rod block to pendant POMs is quite inefficient which may account for the poor device performance. Though the self-assembly process of these hybrid diblock copolymers and the preliminary morphologies has been demonstrated, detailed and systematic study of morphological control requires further extensive research.
