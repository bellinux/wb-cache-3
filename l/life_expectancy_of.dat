40|$|Introduction: <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> {{at birth}} is an {{indicator}} of the mean age that a new born will live and this indicator is one of the criteria for evaluation of the heath, economic and social conditions. Methods: In this descriptive study, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> table <b>of</b> men and women in Yazd state is calculated on the basis of probability of death in different age groups during the years 1996 and 2003. Results: In 1996, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> at birth <b>of</b> women and men were 74. 5 and 71. 9 years, respectively, while these figures in 2003 were 79. 5 and 71. 9 years, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} improvements in <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) over time, {{but it is not}} clear whether these improvements are explained by changes in baseline clinical characteristics, longer duration on ART, or changes in clinical practices. METHOD Two parametric survival models were fitted to mortality data from South African ART cohorts that had linked patient records to the national vital registration system. The first model estimated mortality by age, sex, cohort, baseline CD 4 count, time since ART initiation and period of ART initiation; the second model included only age, sex, cohort and period <b>of</b> follow-up. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancies</b> were calculated from the estimated mortality rates. RESULTS The first model estimated little change in mortality over time: women starting ART at age 35, at CD 4 counts of 200  cells/μl or higher, had <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> 32. 7 (95...|$|R

The Office for National Statistics predicted that by 2031, the percentage of residents over 65 will rise to 37.9. In 2005, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>of</b> female residents was 83.4 years and male residents 79.7 years.

5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>of</b> a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E

Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>of</b> captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
