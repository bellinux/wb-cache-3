5|$|Odin {{was also}} {{closely linked to}} ravens because in Norse myths he {{received}} the fallen warriors at Valhalla, and ravens were linked with death and war due to their predilection for carrion. It is consequently <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were regarded as manifestations of the Valkyries, goddesses who chose the valiant dead for military service in Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|Structure 24 - two crude tennoned zoomorphic heads, {{possibly}} jaguar heads, {{were found}} near this structure but were probably ballcourt markers {{from one of}} the two ballcourts. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> served as a core onto which stucco modelling was applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
50|$|In his book, An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate (1974), he wrote, I {{know nothing}} to {{indicate}} that Nixon was aware {{in advance of the}} plan to break into the Democratic headquarters. It is possible that Mitchell or Haldeman told him in advance, but I think it's <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not have mentioned it unless the operation had produced some results of interest to him. This book was published before Magruder's sentencing on May 21, and before Nixon resigned as the President.|$|R
50|$|Ban the Box is {{the name}} of an {{international}} campaign by civil rights groups and advocates for ex-offenders, aimed at persuading employers to remove from their hiring applications the check box that asks if applicants have a criminal record. Its purpose is to enable ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring process before being asked about their criminal records. The premise of the campaign is that anything that makes it harder for ex-offenders to find a job makes it <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will re-offend, which is bad for society.|$|R

As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|His loyalty {{the crown}} {{was such that}} in 1460 the Yorkists proclaimed him {{one of their most}} mortal enemies among the king's supporters. They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of Wiltshire and Shrewsbury, orchestrated the Yorkists' {{attainder}} at the 1459 Coventry parliament, in order to seize the Yorkists' lands. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way that Henry VI's queen (to whom he was a personal adviser), Margaret of Anjou could not be.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites {{ceased to exist}} as a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il {{is considered to be}} the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God in Islam, alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.|$|E

5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E
5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were obtained {{in a fight with}} another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the heads}} are realistic, unidealised and frank {{descriptions}} of the men. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers well known to the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E
5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of the media at riots has {{had a significant impact}} on water cannon use. There is much pressure on police departments to avoid bad publicity, and water cannon often play badly in the press. It is considered that this is a <b>likely</b> reason <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not used more often in certain countries.|$|R
5000|$|Baphetids {{have been}} {{previously}} considered primitive temnospondyls {{and more recently}} batrachosaurs (reptile-like amphibia). It is <b>likely,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represent one more {{of a number of}} early Carboniferous tetrapodomorph radiations. Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of a data matrix using characteristics of most of the major groups of terrestrial vertebrates place the Baphetids close to the ancestry of amniotes.|$|R
5|$|Siward {{is perhaps}} most famous for his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no {{connection between the two}} events is clear it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were linked.|$|E
5|$|The Davenports {{held the}} manor for around 500 years, {{and it is}} <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, {{and one of the}} first {{recorded}} trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{a former}} Ch'ol-speaking Maya people inhabiting the extreme south {{of what is}} now the Petén Department of modern Guatemala, the area around Lake Izabal (also known as the Golfo Dulce), and {{southern}} Belize. The Manche Ch'ol took the name Manche from the name of their main settlement. They were the last group of eastern Cholan-speakers to remain independent and ethnically distinct. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were descended from the inhabitants of Classic period (c. 250-900 AD) Maya cities in the southeastern Maya region, such as Nim Li Punit, Copán and Quiriguá.|$|E

5|$|The three recent {{treatments}} (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a {{total of}} 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting {{of four or five}} species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.attaleoides—A.camopiensis, A.degranvillei, A.guianensis and A.maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A.guianensis, A.maripensis and A.attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all represented the same species.|$|E
5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The tips of the jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It is more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{allegiance}} of Felix to Canterbury {{determined the}} Roman {{basis of the}} East Anglian Church, influenced along continental lines, though Felix's training in Burgundy may have been coloured by {{the teaching of the}} Irish missionary Saint Columbanus in Luxeuil. In around 633, perhaps shortly before Saint Aidan was sent to Lindisfarne from Iona, the Irish royal hermit and missionary Saint Fursey came to East Anglia from the Athlone area, along with his priests and brethren. Sigeberht granted him a monastery site in an old Roman fort called Cnobheresburg, usually identified as Burgh Castle, near Great Yarmouth. Felix and Fursey both effected a large number of conversions and established many churches in Sigeberht's kingdom. Bede records that Archbishop Honorius and Bishop Felix much admired the work of Saint Aidan of Lindisfarne and it is therefore <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> also appreciated the tasks accomplished by Saint Fursey, whose community also lived according to the ascetic principles of Irish Christianity.|$|E
5000|$|As a group, {{they prefer}} {{temperate}} waters and {{are far more}} diverse in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern. Some are anadromous migrants and many are quite euryhaline.
