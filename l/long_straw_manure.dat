40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the physicochemical properties as well as the fertilizing and crop-yielding value of <b>straw</b> and cellulose <b>manure</b> after a 6 -month storage period. Before field application pH value and contents of dry matter, TC, Corg. and N in cellulose manure were higher than in <b>straw</b> <b>manure.</b> The application of cellulose manure caused an increase in pH and the contents of P and K in the soil. The contents of DM, TC, Corg., as well as N and P in the rye grain collected from a field with cellulose manure were higher than in the rye grain collected from a field with <b>straw</b> <b>manure.</b> It follows that the soil fertilized with the cellulose manure was more conducive to the mineralization and sorption of macroelements assimilable by plants. The cellulose manure demonstrated better fertilizing value than the <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and increased the yield potential of the soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{interplanting}} with zero-tillage of rice, i. e. direct sowing rice 10 â€“ 20 {{days before}} wheat harvesting, and remaining about 30 -cm high stubble after cutting wheat or rice with no tillage, {{is a new}} cultivation technology in wheat-rice rotation system. To {{study the effects of}} interplanting with zero tillage and <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> on rice growth and quality, an experiment was conducted in a wheat-rotation rotation system. Four treatments, i. e. ZIS (Zero-tillage, <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice interplanting), ZI (Zero-tillage, no <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice interplanting), PTS (Plowing tillage, <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice transplanting), and PT (Plowing tillage, no <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> and rice transplanting), were used. ZIS reduced plant height, leaf area per plant and the biomass of rice plants, but the biomass accumulation of rice at the late stage was quicker than that under conventional transplanting cultivation. In the first year (2002), {{there was no significant difference}} in rice yield among the four treatments. However, rice yield decreased in interplanting with zero-tillage in the second year (2003). Compared with the transplanting treatments, the number of filled grains per panicle decreased but 1000 -grain weight increased in interplanting with zero-tillage, which were the main factors resulting in higher yield. Interplanting with zero-tillage improved the milling and appearance qualities of rice. The rates of milled and head rice increased while chalky rice rate and chalkiness decreased in interplanting with zero-tillage. Zero-tillage and interplanting also affected rice nutritional and cooking qualities. In 2002, ZIS showed raised protein content, decreased amylose content, softer gel consistency, resulting in improved rice quality. In 2003, zero-tillage and interplanting decreased protein content and showed similar amylose content as compared with transplanting treatments. Moreover, protein content in PTS was obviously increased in comparison with the other three treatments. The rice in interplanting with zero-tillage treatments had higher peak viscosity and breakdown, lower setback, showing better rice taste quality. The <b>straw</b> <b>manure</b> had no significant effect on rice viscosity under interplanting with zero-tillage, but had the negative influence on the rice taste quality under transplanting with plowing tillage...|$|R

40|$|Up to {{the present}} day, wood {{has been used to}} supply the needs for cooking in rural Africa. Due to the ongoing deforestation, {{households}} need to change to other energy sources. To cover this need, a large amount of people are using residues from agriculture (<b>straw,</b> <b>manure)</b> instead. However, both <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> also have a function in agriculture for soil improvement. Using all the <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> will seriously affect the food production. In this paper we first determine the amount of energy that households need for cooking (about 7 GJ per year). Then we estimate the amount of residues that can be obtained from the agricultural system and the amount of energy for cooking that can be derived from this amount when different conversion techniques are used. The amount of residues needed is strongly affected by the technology used. The traditional three stone fires require at least two times as much resource than the more advanced technologies. Up to 4 ha of land or 15 cows are needed to provide enough <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> to cook on the traditional three stone fires. When more efficient techniques are used (briquetting, biogas) this can be reduced to 2 ha and six cows. Due to large variation in resource availability between households, about 80 % of the households own less than 2 ha and 70 % holds less than four cows. This means that even when modern, energy efficient techniques are used the largest share of the population is not able to generate enough energy for cooking from their own land and/or cattle. Most rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa may share similar resource holding characteristics for which the results from the current findings on Ethiopia can be relevant...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} to herbicides in dwarf apple orchards (Malus pumila Mill.) {{is the use}} of mulches. Research objectives were to compare several mulch systems (Festuca rubra L., Lupinus albus L. plus Daucus carota L.; <b>straw,</b> <b>manure</b> compost, geotextile) with soil cultivation as to soil physical properties and plant nutrient levels in soils, leaves and fruit. Studies carried out in 1992 and 1993 on three dwarf apple orchards on the Macdonald Campus of McGill University showed that straw mulch increased soil water contents and exchangeable K, but reduced exchangeable Mg compared to Festuca mulch. Straw mulch reduced soil temperatures in summer relative to geotextile or cultivation. Festuca reduced leaf N contents but increased leaf P contents-elative to geotextile treatments. Soil nitrate N contents were correlated with soil water contents, and the ratios N/Ca and K/Ca in the fruit were unaffected by treatment. Straw and geotextile mulches increased soil water content and nitrate-N levels during peak sowing periods and thus were the superior treatments...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} on a two-years field {{experiment}} aimed at the quantification of the emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) from the dominant wheat maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The experiment had 6 different fertilization strategies, including a control treatment, recommended fertilization, with and without <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> applications, and nitrification inhibitor and slow release urea. Application of N fertilizer slightly decreased CH 4 uptake by soil. Direct N 2 O emissions derived from recommended urea application was 0. 39 % of the annual urea-N input. Both <b>straw</b> and <b>manure</b> had relatively low N 2 O emissions factors. Slow release urea had a relatively high emission factor. Addition of nitrification inhibitor reduced N 2 O emission by 55 %. We conclude that use of nitrification inhibitors is a promising strategy for N 2 O mitigation for the intensive wheat maize double cropping systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
