30|$|Implementation {{of radio}} network and service {{functions}} in C-RAN environments will simplify the mapping of SDN and NFV features (known from core function virtualization in data centers) to the RAN. It also increases flexibility {{with respect to}} integration of decentralized core functions in C-RAN processing units like local mobility management, <b>local</b> <b>breakouts,</b> and content delivery networks (CDNs) with caching capabilities [50]. Due to centralized processing and minimum delay among baseband processing units (BBUs), C-RAN environments allow simplified clustering of cells for joint RRM and interference coordination (including coordinated multipoint transmission/reception (CoMP)). Dependent on network infrastructure availability of the mobile network operator and delay limitations set on back-/fronthaul links b, e.g., by CoMP schemes, C-RANs can be deployed in a distributed or more centralized way, which differentiate {{especially in terms of}} the number of contained BBUs (realizable via virtual machines on general purpose processors, possibly with support of hardware accelerators for dedicated physical layer computing tasks). Nevertheless, the BBU number of a local C-RAN can be also high in case of UDN, e.g., for a stadium scenario.|$|R
40|$|Explosion {{of mobile}} traffic {{will bring a}} heavy burden to the core network, and rapid growth of mobile devices, as well as {{increasing}} demand for delay-sensitive services poses severe challenges to future wireless communication systems. In this regard, <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> is a promising solution to save core network load and, more importantly, to reduce end-to-end (e 2 e) delay of packets with local significance. However, the capacity of <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> link is limited, resulting in excessive delay when the traffic load through the local link is high. Therefore, the decision on whether the traffic flows should be transmitted through core network or by <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> link has great practical significance. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> framework to deliver low e 2 e delay packets with local significance. A real-time <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> rule based on the solution to a Markov decision process is given, showing that some packets with local significance should pass through core network rather than being delivered by <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> link to meet the delay requirements. To test our proposed framework, a long-term-evolution (LTE) based test-bed with virtual base stations is implemented, by which we show the proposed framework is feasible and the e 2 e delay is significantly reduced.

40|$|Abstract. For {{engineering}} ceramics, cracks {{produced in}} preparation process, i. e. sintering and surface finishing, {{have a profound}} impact on the mechanical strength and wear. Under cavitation loading, the flaws on the surface and subsurface are preferentially eroded. In this paper, artificial cracks are introduced on WC ceramic by indentation of a Vickers indenter at a load of 10 kgf. Five positions on the cavitation eroded area are selected. The average length of the cracks is 71. 6 µm. The cavitation erosion tests are terminated at 1, 3, and 5 min to reveal the evolution of cracks. A single pattern for the evolution of cracks is recognized. Two new cracks at the tip of indentation cracks first nucleate and then propagate (accompanied by pullout of grains). The angle between the two new cracks ranges from 30 ° to 45 °. The evolution of adjunct two groups of cracks gives birth to <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> finally. Steps provided limited resistance to breakout are observed. The nucleation and propagation of the four indentation cracks do not always occur simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|When the {{two eyes}} view {{incompatible}} images that subtend the entire visual field, perception alternates {{between the two}} images unpredictably: at seemingly random times and locations, observers experience sudden changes in the awareness of the unchanging visual stimulation. Here {{we focus on the}} very first spontaneous breakout from the very first suppression phase after onset of the two eyes' competing whole-field stimuli. We call such spontaneous <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> an "initial percept-switch nucleation. " We employed homogeneous visual input to examine where, and how, spontaneous local initial percept-switch nucleations originate, demonstrating that their spatial distribution contains locally random inhomogeneities, which are eye- and observer-dependent. We were able to predict the occurrence probability of the percept nucleations by adaptation buildup of the neurons associated with the representation of one eye's image. Intriguingly, the neuronal processes related to both cross-inhibition and local eye dominance could not predict nucleation probability; this is because nucleation inhomogeneity appeared to be different from another previously reported local inhomogeneity known as "onset bias" signifying the local first dominance-choice inhomogeneity upon stimulus onset. Collectively, we reveal a governing role of local adaptation in the neurons associated with early visual processing of one eye's image, in the origination of new phases in awarenes...|$|E

The <b>local</b> Internet <b>breakout</b> solution provides improved performance when accessing cloud-based applications along with a greater user experience. The reason behind this is not having data travel through the corporate WAN to access the Internet at a single point. This new network design solution not only improves user experience by lower latency when accessing the Internet, but also offloading the applications traffic from corporate WAN connections. The main theme {{of this study was}} to experiment how <b>local</b> could Internet <b>breakout</b> can help a corporation improve network performance, save band-width on corporate WAN link and to improve the end-user experience.

40|$|We propose Multi-HDCS, a new hybrid {{approach}} for solving Distributed CSPs with complex local problems. In Multi-HDCS, each agent concurrently: (i) runs a centralised systematic search for its complex local problem; (ii) participates in a distributed local search; (iii) {{contributes to a}} distributed systematic search. A centralised systematic search algorithm runs on each agent, finding all non-interchangeable solutions to the agent’s complex local problem. In order {{to find a solution}} to the overall problem, two distributed algorithms which only consider the local solutions found by the centralised systematic searches are run: a local search algorithm identifies the parts of the problem which are most difficult to satisfy, and this information is used in order to find good dynamic variable orderings for a systematic search. We present two implementations of our approach which differ in the strategy used for <b>local</b> search: <b>breakout</b> and penalties on values. Results from an extensive empirical evaluation indicate that these two Multi-HDCS implementations are competitive against existing distributed local and systematic search techniques on both solvable and unsolvable distributed CSPs with complex local problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{present day}} {{state of stress}} has a key {{influence}} on fluid flow through fractured geo-reservoirs. Breakouts are commonly used as principal indicator of stress direction. However, variation of breakout orientation with depth, especially {{in the vicinity of}} fracture zones, is frequently observed. This study describes a systematic analysis of breakout occurrence, variation of breakout orientation and its modeling. Numerical modeling which taking into account the elastic property changes as a result of fracturing and fracture filling is developed to better quantify the very local scale breakout orientation heterogeneity observed in this study. Two different mechanisms for the breakout rotation are proposed. Anomalies of breakout orientation in the vicinity of fracture zones reflect the large-scale stress heterogeneity which might be caused by the previous slip acting on the fault plane. While the <b>local</b> <b>breakout</b> orientation anomalies around minor fractures might be the effect of the material heterogeneities around borehole due the intersection between the borehole with the fracture. The results of this study provide a better understanding of stress-induced borehole elongations in fractured rocks. Borehole breakout heterogeneities {{do not seem to be}} related to the principal stress heterogeneity only, but also to the effect of mechanical heterogeneities like weak zones with different elastic moduli, rock strength and fracture patterns. Consequently, care has to be taken when inferring the principal stress orientation from borehole breakout data observed in fractured rock. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} a recently proposed adaptive diversification strategy (ADS) {{to the performance of}} an iterated local search (ILS) algorithm. ADS is used as a diversification mechanism by <b>breakout</b> <b>local</b> search (BLS), which is a new variant of the ILS metaheuristic. The proposed perturbation strategy adaptively selects between two types of perturbations (directed or random moves) of different intensities, depending on the current state of search. We experimentally evaluate the performance of ADS on the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and the maximum clique problem (MAX-CLQ). Computational results accentuate the benefit of combining adaptively multiple perturbation types of different intensities. Moreover, we provide some guidance on when to introduce a weaker and when to introduce a stronger diversification into the search...|$|R

The proposed heuristic is highly competitive with the exact state-of-art approaches from {{the literature on the}} current VSP benchmark.

40|$|The {{quadratic}} assignment problem (QAP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied NP-hard problems with various practical applications.

BMA integrates an effective local optimization algorithm called <b>Breakout</b> <b>Local</b> Search (BLS) within the evolutionary computing framework which itself is based on a uniform crossover, a fitness-based pool updating strategy and an adaptive mutation procedure. Extensive computational studies on the set of 135 well-known benchmark instances from the QAPLIB revealed that the proposed algorithm is able to attain the best-known results for 133 instances and thus competes very favorably with the current most effective QAP approaches. A study of the search landscape and crossover operators is also proposed to shed light on the behavior of the algorithm...|$|R

Out of the 71 benchmark instances, BLS is capable of finding new improved results in 33 cases and attaining the previous best-known result for 35 instances, within a computational time ranging from less than one second to 5. 6 hours for the largest instance with 20000 vertices...|$|R

40|$|The Steiner tree problem (STP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{combinatorial}} optimization problems with various practical applications. In this paper, we propose a <b>Breakout</b> <b>Local</b> Search (BLS) algorithm for an important generalization of the STP: the Steiner tree problem with revenue, budget and hop constraints (STPRBH), which consists of determining a subtree of a given undirected graph which maximizes the collected revenues, subject to both budget and hop constraints. Starting from a probabilistically constructed initial solution, BLS uses a Neighborhood Search (NS) procedure based on several specifically designed move operators for local optimization, and employs an adaptive diversification strategy to escape from local optima. The diversification mechanism is implemented by adaptive perturbations, guided by dedicated information of discovered high-quality solutions. Computational results based on 240 benchmarks show that BLS produces competitive results with respect to several previous approaches. For the 56 most challenging instances with unknown optimal results, BLS succeeds in improving 49 and matching one best known results within reasonable time. For the 184 instances which have been solved to optimality, BLS can also match 167 optimal results...|$|R

40|$|We use {{idealized}} three-dimensional hydrodynamic {{simulations of}} global galactic discs {{to study the}} launching of galactic winds by supernovae (SNe). The simulations resolve the cooling radii {{of the majority of}} supernova remnants (SNRs) and thus self-consistently capture how SNe drive galactic winds. We find that SNe launch highly supersonic winds with properties that agree reasonably well with expectations from analytic models. The energy loading (η_E = Ė_ wind / Ė_ SN) of the winds in our simulations are well converged with spatial resolution while the wind mass loading (η_M = Ṁ_ wind / Ṁ_) decreases with resolution at the resolutions we achieve. We present a simple analytic model based on the concept that SNRs with cooling radii greater than the <b>local</b> scale height <b>breakout</b> of the disc and power the wind. This model successfully explains the dependence (or lack thereof) of η_E (and by extension η_M) on the gas surface density, star formation efficiency, disc radius, and the clustering of SNe. The winds in the majority of our simulations are weaker than expected in reality, likely {{due to the fact that}} we seed SNe preferentially at density peaks. Clustering SNe in time and space substantially increases the wind power. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures. Movies available at [URL]...|$|R
