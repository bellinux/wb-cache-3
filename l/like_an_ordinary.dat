5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> fluid.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

30|$|In addition, a small {{device called}} Anoto Digital Pen [7] {{can be used}} to send written strokes as digital {{information}} without any scanner or camera device. Furthermore, regular paper printed with the Anoto dot pattern in the background is enough for Anoto pen to operate. No special material and electric parts are needed to mount on the paper for this method. This is a great advantage for the purpose of sticky-note-based interaction because we can treat the sticky note <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>ordinary</b> one and throw away a waste sticky note. That is why we chose Anoto Pen as the input device of our paper-based interactive system.|$|R

25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does. For instance, a curve with fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> surface, but {{one with a}} fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume. This general relationship {{can be seen in}} the two images of fractal curves in Fig.2 and Fig. 3 – the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of 1.26.|$|E

This has the effect of driving away those with the resources to buy original paintings.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} number of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers are designed to store notes upright & facing forward, instead of the traditional flat & facing upright position. This enables faster access to each note and allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Sometimes the cashier will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are flip top in design, where they flip open instead of sliding out <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.|$|E
25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking {{up and down the stairs}} (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E

Probyn's efforts are frustrated by the complex structure of the dominant Maciver family, which seeks to deal with Robbie internally.
