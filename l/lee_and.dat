5|$|<b>Lee</b> <b>and</b> Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and <b>Lee</b> <b>and</b> Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. <b>Lee</b> <b>and</b> Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy <b>Lee</b> <b>and</b> Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition.
