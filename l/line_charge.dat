[...] However, {{he was not able}} to reach Wayne in time to recall him. [...] He immediately began moving additional troops forward in an attempt to prevent the trap from closing on Wayne. [...] In the meantime, the British charge had thrown the Americans into some confusion, and Wayne was concerned that a retreat would turn into a disorderly rout. [...] Wayne reformed his line, ordered his artillery to fire a blast of grape shot, and then had the <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> the numerically overwhelming British with bayonets fixed.|$|E

2500|$|One {{experiment}} was mounting a [...] "flying hose" [...] on an LCA as a mine-clearing <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> device for clearing mines and obstacles on beaches. The LCA was {{fitted with a}} coil of hose, attached to a rocket. The rocket would carry the hose onto the beach, the crew would pump nitroglycerine into the hose, and then attach an explosive charge to the near end and throw it overboard. Fortunately, this system was never used operationally. The same concept was employed by the 79th Armoured Division (called [...] "Congers"), using Universal Carriers. The nitroglycerin supply for the unit using them accidentally ignited - causing great damage and loss of life.|$|E

5000|$|The M58 Mine Clearing <b>Line</b> <b>Charge</b> (MICLIC) is a rocket-projected {{explosive}} <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> {{which provides}} a [...] "close-in" [...] demining capability for maneuver forces of the United States Army and Marine Corps. It is effective against conventionally fuzed land mines and, when detonated, it provides a lane 8 meters by 100 meters. The MICLIC system consists of an M353 3½ ton or M200A1 2½ ton trailer (or M200 tracked trailer) chassis, a launcher assembly, an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> and a 5-inch MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> is 350 feet long and contains 5 pounds per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet {{along the length of}} it. Due to the inherent dangers of entering a live minefield to manually arm the backup fuses on a charge that could still detonate at any moment, possibly while under enemy fire as well, the act is jokingly referred to as the [...] "Medal of Honor run".|$|E
