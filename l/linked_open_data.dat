40|$|The {{emergence}} of the <b>Linking</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> Cloud (LODC) {{is an example of}} the adoption of Linked Data principles and the creation of a Web of Data. There is an increasing amount of information linked across member datasets of the LODC by means of RDF links, yet there is little support for a human to understand which datasets are connected to one another. This research presents a novel approach for understanding these interconnections with the publicly accessible tool LODNav – <b>Linking</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> Navigator. LODNav provides a visualization metaphor of the LODC by positioning member datasets of the LODC on a world map based on the geographical location of the dataset. This interactive tool aims to provide a dynamic up-to-date visualization of the LODC and allows the extraction of information about the datasets as well as their interconnections as RDF data...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{the number of}} freely {{available}} <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> datasets has multiplied into tens of thousands. The numbers of applications taking advantage of it, however, have not. Thus, large portions of potentially valuable data remain unexploited and are inaccessible for lay users. Therefore the upfront investment in releasing data {{in the first place}} is hard to justify. The lack of applications needs to be addressed in order not to undermine efforts put into <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data.</b> In existing research, strong indicators can be found that the dearth of applications is {{due to a lack of}} pragmatic, working architectures supporting these applications and guiding developers. In this thesis, a new architecture for the integration and application of <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> is presented. Fundamental design decisions are backed up by two studies: firstly, based on real-world <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> samples, characteristic properties are identified. A key finding is the fact that large amounts of structured data display tabular structures, do not use clear licensing and involve multiple different file formats. Secondly, following on from that study, a comparison of storage choices in relevant query scenarios is made. It includes the de-facto standard storage choice in this domain, Triples Stores, as well as relational and NoSQL approaches. Results show significant performance deficiencies of some technologies in certain scenarios. Consequently, when integrating <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> in scenarios with application-specific entities, the first choice of storage is relational databases. Combining these findings and related best practices of existing research, a prototype framework is implemented using Java 8 and Hibernate. As a proof-of-concept it is employed in an existing <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> integration project. Thereby, it is shown that a best practice architectural component is introduced successfully, while development effort to implement specific program code can be simplified. Thus, the present work provides an important foundation for the development of semantic applications based on <b>Linked</b> and <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> and potentially leads to a broader adoption of such applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{ever-increasing}} {{availability of}} <b>linked</b> <b>open</b> geospatial <b>data</b> provides an unprecedented source of geo-information to describe urban environments. This wealth of data should {{be turned into}} actionable knowledge: for example, <b>open</b> <b>data</b> {{could be used as}} a proxy or substitute for closed or expensive information. The successful employment of <b>linked</b> <b>open</b> geospatial <b>data</b> can pave the way for innovative solutions to smart city problems. In this paper, we illustrate a set of experiments that, starting from <b>linked</b> <b>open</b> geospatial <b>data,</b> execute a knowledge discovery process to predict urban semantics. More specifically, we leverage geo-information about points of interests as input in a classification model of land use at a moderate spatial resolution (250 meters) over wide urban areas in Europe. We replicate our experiments in different European cities—Milano, München, Barcelona and Brussels—to ensure the repeatability and generality of our approach, and we explain the experimental conditions, as well as the employed datasets to guarantee reproducibility. We extensively report on quantitative and qualitative evaluation results, to judge the validity, as well as the limitations of our proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The massively {{distributed}} {{publication of}} linked data {{has brought to}} the attention of scientific community the limitations of classic methods for achieving data integration and the opportunities of pushing the boundaries of the field by experimenting this collective enterprise that is the <b>linking</b> <b>open</b> <b>data</b> cloud. While reusing existing ontologies is the choice of preference, the exploitation of ontology alignments still is a required step for easing the burden of integrating heterogeneous data sets. Alignments, even between the most used vocabularies, is still poorly supported in systems nowadays whereas links between instances are the most widely used means for bridging the gap between different data sets. We provide in this paper an account of our statistical and qualitative analysis of the network of instance level equivalences in the <b>Linking</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Data</b> Cloud (i. e. the sameAs network) in order to automatically compute alignments at the conceptual level. Moreover, we explore the effect of ontological information when adopting classical Jaccard methods to the ontology alignment task. Automating such task will allow in fact to achieve a clearer conceptual description of the data at the cloud level, while improving the level of integration between datasets. <br/...|$|R
