5000|$|<b>Lofendazam</b> is {{an organic}} {{molecule}} {{which is a}} benzodiazepine derivative. <b>Lofendazam</b> is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, with the nitrogen atoms located at positions 1 and 5 of the diazepine ring; therefore, <b>lofendazam</b> is most closely related to other 1,5-benzodiazepines such as clobazam.|$|E
50|$|Arfendazam {{produces}} an active metabolite <b>lofendazam,</b> which {{is thought to}} be responsible for part of its effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofendazam</b> {{as a human}} {{pharmaceutical}} has sedative and anxiolytic effects {{similar to}} those produced by other benzodiazepine derivatives. It is an active metabolite of another benzodiazepine, arfendazam.|$|E
50|$|Like other 1,5-benzodiazepines (e.g., arfendazam, <b>lofendazam,</b> CP-1414S), {{the active}} {{metabolite}} N-desmethyl-clobazam has less {{affinity for the}} α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has higher affinity for α2 containing receptors, where it has positive modulatory activity.|$|E
