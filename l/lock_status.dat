We developed a finite-element model using visco-elasto-plastic rheology.

We show that the amount of interseismic fault locking, and thus the seismic potential, is not necessarily associated with the fastest-slipping faults. More specifically, the locked Bassano thrust has a greater seismic potential than the freely slipping Montello thrust. The findings suggest that faults with subtle evidence of Quaternary activity should be carefully considered when creating seismic hazard maps...|$|R

5000|$|As part of [...] "really shared files" [...] (stage three above), file locking was {{introduced}} to control simultaneous access to shared files between active MTS sessions (that is, between separate running tasks or processes). File locking does not limit or block access to files within a single MTS session (between command language subsystems or user programs running {{as part of the}} same MTS session).File locking in MTS is mandatory rather than advisory. Files are locked implicitly on first use of a particular type of access or explicitly using the $LOCK command or the LOCK subroutine. Files are unlocked implicitly when the last use of a file within a task is closed or explicitly using the $UNLOCK command or the UNLK subroutine.

50|$|The unlock code is {{verified}} by the handset and {{is generated by}} the manufacturer, typically by an algorithm such as a one way hash or trapdoor function. Sometimes big telecom providers change the original factory unlock codes as an extra layer of security against unlocking services. For various big brands such as Samsung and Motorola there is no algorithm but just a random code generator where the unlock codes are programmed in the phone itself and then saved in a big database managed by the manufacturer. For the other brands where the unlock codes are still based on algorithms those {{are based on the}} IMEI number and the MCC code and have been reverse-engineered, stolen or leaked. Some handsets can be unlocked using software that generates an unlock code from an IMEI number and country and operator details using the algorithm specific to the handset. Other manufacturers have taken a more cautious approach, and embed a random number in the handset's firmware that is retained by the network on whose behalf the lock was applied and the manufacturer. These handsets can still be unlocked by online services that have access to either inside people with the manufacturer or with the telecom networks, or they need to be connected to the computer with a cable where specific software will bypass the security and SIM-unlock the phone. Sometimes this is done by advanced calculations to bypass the security the official way and other times using exploits or overwriting parts of the firmware where the <b>lock</b> <b>status</b> is kept, and often even recover a phone that is bricked or completely damaged in the software sense.|$|E

There are many choices of cars in the market, from budget cars to the luxurious cars, only a matter now is affordability. One of the important aspects of a car is security because car theft is a crime that occurs all around the world, including Malaysia. Currently, local car manufacturers in Malaysia provides a standard security system for each car manufactured, that is central locking system and standard car alarm. The focus is on the car locking system, where the conventional remote for the car locking system is commonly consists of two buttons, which is the first, is for lock and unlock function and the second button is for the car alarm. There is no indicator that indicates the <b>lock</b> <b>status</b> of the car, acting as the double confirmation for the <b>lock</b> <b>status.</b> Here comes the idea to improve the conventional car lock system by adding an indicator to work as the second confirmation for the car <b>lock</b> <b>status.</b> The project is named as Car Lock Indicator and using microcontroller Motorola MC 68 HC 11 A 1 as the heart of the system.

40|$|High-performance {{digital systems}} use clocks to {{sequence}} operations and synchronize between functional units and between ICs. Clock frequencies and data {{rates have been}} increasing with each generation of processing technology and processor architecture. Phase locked-loops (PLLs) are widely used to generate well-timed on-chip clocks in high-performance digital systems. A PLL is a closed loop frequency system that locks the phase of an output signal to an input reference signal. PLL’s are widely used in computer, radio, and telecommunications systems where {{it is necessary to}} stabilize a generated signal or to detect signals. The term “lock” refers to a constant or zero phase difference between two signals. The signal from the feedback path is compared to the input reference signal, until the two signals are locked. If the phase is unmatched, this is called the unlocked state, and the signal is sent to each component in the loop to correct the phase difference. These components consist of the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), the charge pump (CP), the low pass filter (LPF), the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and divide by counter. The PFD detects any phase differences in and and then generates an error signal. According to that error signal the CP either increases or decreases the amount of charge to the LPF. This amount of charge either speeds up or slows down the VCO. The loop continues in this process until the phase difference between and is zero or constant—this is the locked mode. After the loop has attained a <b>locked</b> <b>status,</b> the loop still continues in the process but the output of each component is constant. The output signal has the same phase and/or frequency as. A divider can be used in the feedback path to synthesize a frequency different than that of the reference signal. The application I chose in designing the PLL was a frequency synthesizer. A frequency synthesizer generates a frequency that can have a different frequency from the original reference signal...|$|R

The relationship among mean-time-to-lose-lock (MTLL), detection threshold and lock probability related to C/N 0 can be further discovered by utilizing this probability.

40|$|The Java {{language}} combines object-oriented and concurrency features. Both sets {{of features}} {{are difficult to}} understand and handle, and combining them increases their complexity. A program developer {{must be aware of}} objects that become locked and unreachable.
