40|$|In {{this thesis}} we give an {{overview}} of recent stochastic <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>models</b> and present a new particle model for turbulent dispersion and chemical reactions. Our purpose is to investigate and assess the feasibility of the <b>Lagrangian</b> approach for <b>modelling</b> the turbulent dispersion and chemistry interactions. We emphasise the numerical aspects and advantages of the method for the implementation on (massively) parallel computers. In Chapter 1, a general introduction {{to the topic of}} modelling turbulent transport and chemistry is given. Before we direct most of our attention to <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>modelling,</b> we give {{an overview of}} Eulerian models for turbulent transport and chemistry, like direct numerical, large eddy and Reynolds averaged simulations in Chapter 2. We begin the treatment of <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>modelling</b> with a detailed survey of the stochastic Lagrangian theory (Chapter 3). In stochastic models turbulence is considered as a stochastic process. Accordingly the concentration is a stochastic function and can be modelled by its mean, its uctuations and higher statistical moments. By generating many one-particle trajectories we are able to predict the mean concentration only. The second moment of the concentration can be inferred from the statistics of particle pair trajectories. Models based on one-particle trajectories are discussed in Chapter 4. In the same chapter we give a short overview of the problems that arise if one attempts to formulate relative di usion models and present Kaplan and Dinar's model to describe the trajectories of pairs of uid particles. There are to our knowledge only a few <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>models</b> for the turbulent transport of reactive constituents. In Chapter 5 an overview of these models is given. We also propose some improvements in these models and present a new one-particle model. We present, in Chapter 6 a new two-particle model for turbulent transport and chemistry interactions. The results of the new two-particle model for transport and chemistry are discussed in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 the parallel implementation aspects of <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>models</b> and of the new two-particle model in particular are discussed. Finally the conclusions from the present study are summarised in Chapter 9...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A Lagrangian {{stochastic}} model {{was used to}} estimate the fetch and latent heat flux above a nonuniform grass-covered forest clearing site at the Duke Forest, in Durham, North Carolina, and an irrigated bare soil patch at the University of California in Davis. The latent heat flux predictions by the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model</b> compared well with eddy correlation flux measurements. In order to apply the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model</b> to a nonuniform grass-covered forest clearing, the surface was treated as an imaginary “equivalent ” uniform terrain subjected to surface roughness and turbulence statistics (i. e., mean, variance, and covariance) of velocities and scalars identical to those measured above the nonuniform terrain. At the irrigated bare soil site the equilibrium distance of the air from dry to wet was well defined, and its influence on the water vapor flux internal boundary layer was considered. In the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model,</b> five different schemes to account for inhomogeneous turbulent flows were compared in terms of estimating scalar fluxes. Our comparisons demonstrate that the five different schemes produce similar scalar fluxes {{despite the fact that}} some of them do not satisfy the well-mixed criterion.

Previous studies have suggested that EIs of some reactive alkenes, in particular, may be far too low, leading to the failure of corresponding operational air quality modelS (OAQMS) to simulate the observed transient high ozone episodes (THOEs).

40|$|The breathing-mode isoscalar giant {{monopole}} resonance (GMR) is investigated {{using the}} generator coordinate method within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory. Employing the Lagrangian {{models of the}} nonlinear-σ model (NLσ), the scalar-vector interaction model (SVI) and the σ-ω coupling model (SIGO), we show that each <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model</b> exhibits a distinctly different GMR response. Consequently, Lagrangian models yield a different value of the GMR energy for a given value of the nuclear matter incompressibility K_∞. It is shown that this effect arises largely from a different value of the surface incompressibility K_surf inherent to each <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model,</b> thus giving rise to the ratio K_surf/K_∞ which depends upon the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model</b> used. This is attributed to {{a difference in the}} density dependence of the meson masses and hence to the density dependence of the nuclear interaction amongst various Lagrangian models. The sensitivity of the GMR energy to the <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>model</b> used and thus emergence of a multitude of GMR energies for a given value of K_∞ renders the method of extracting K_∞ on the basis of interpolation amongst forces as inappropriate. As a remedy, the need to 'calibrate' the density dependence of the nuclear interaction in the RMF theory is proposed. Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures; Accepted in Nucl. Phys. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to photochemical modeling is investigated and a <b>lagrangian</b> particle <b>model</b> named Photochemical <b>Lagrangian</b> Particle <b>Model</b> (PLPM) is described. <b>Lagrangian</b> particle <b>models</b> are a consolidated tool to deal with the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Good results have been obtained dealing with inert pollutants. In recent years, a number of pioneering works have shown as <b>Lagrangian</b> <b>models</b> can be of great interest when dealing with photochemistry, provided that special care is given in the reconstruction of chemicals concentration in the atmosphere. Density reconstruction can be performed through the so called ''box counting'' method: an Eulerian grid for chemistry is introduced and density is computed counting particles in each box. In this way one of the main advantages of the Lagrangian approach, the grid independence, is lost. Photochemical reactions are treated in PLPM by means of the complex chemical mechanism SAPRC 90 and four density reconstruction methods have been developed, based on the kernel density estimator approach, in order to obtain grid-free accurate concentrations.
