40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis verifies {{random allocation}} of <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> of {{vehicles in the}} capital city of Prague. The aim is to determine whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> have a statistically significantly higher purchase price, which disproves random allocation. The second aim is to verify whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> statistically significantly use the left lane in the driving direction, which is the lane designated for overtaking. The data needed to verify these hypotheses was gained by two day measuring during which were captured more than 4, 000 vehicles. From footbridge over the Nuselský Bridge in Prague were recorded passing vehicles using the camera. From the entire sample were randomly generated 184 vehicles. For cars was estimated the purchase price in the time of allocation of <b>registration</b> <b>number.</b> The numerical combinations of <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> were divided into three categories according to attractiveness. These categories were compared with each other in the three models based on their average prices. According to measurement results we can at one percent significance level reject the null hypothesis and say that at this level of significance are not the <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> allocated randomly. The result of the fourth model is not statistically significant. It did not confirm that the vehicles with an attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> use more left lane in the direction of travel...|$|R
