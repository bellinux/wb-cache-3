Because the neutron and surface heat loads are higher in APEX designs than those in conventional fusion designs, decay heat and activation are generally higher presenting an increased challenge when justifying the safety case. Potential first wall materials that can function adequately under higher neutron and heat loads include materials such as tungsten and molybdenum. The activation products of both these materials are radiologically hazardous and mobilizable under accident conditions. We have examined a number of APEX concepts to determine the ability of the design to remove decay heat from the plasma-facing surface during a loss of coolant and air ingress event.

40|$|A few {{exploratory}} {{tests were}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of cyclic work softening on the mechanical properties of a hard commercially pure al-uminum. Cyclic work softening, or fatigue softening, is the loss of mech-anical strength and the accompanying reduction in surface hardness which 2 some materials show under cyclic loading [1]. Like hardening under cyclic loads, softening under cyclic loads is limited and usually takes place only during the first 10 - 25 % of the fatigue life. Cyclic hardening or soften-ing occurs only if there is plastic strain produced by each loading i. e. only if there is a mechanical hysteresis loop for the cyclic loading. Note that the material exhibits softening only in a cycle or on the reversal of <b>load.</b> <b>Materials</b> which soften cyclically do show normal stable strain harden-ing under monotonic loading [2].
