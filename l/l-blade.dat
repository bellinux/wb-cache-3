After {{studying}} and analyzing {{the types of}} cutter roller’s movable blades, various arrangements and layouts of movable blades and structures of such cutter roller of current sugarcane leaf shattering and returning machine in China, a totally new cutter roller design is proposed for 1 GYF- 200 sugarcane leaf shattering and returning machine: blades are arranged in unequally-spaced double-helix symmetry, the movable blades arranged {{on both sides of}} the cutter roller are increased appropriately, and combination of two straight blades and one improved <b>L-blade</b> are adopted as movable blades. Comparing with the original prototype, the improved machine’s pick-up rate has increased by 0. 8 % and shattering rate has improved by 2. 5 %. This study provides theoretical basis and reference in designing an effective and reliable machine for shattering sugarcane leaves and incorporating it into soil...|$|E
