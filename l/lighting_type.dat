40|$|We {{investigated}} the optimal spectral bands for {{the identification of}} lighting types and the estimation of four major indices {{used to measure the}} efficiency or character of lighting. To accomplish these objectives we collected high-resolution emission spectra (350 to 2, 500 nm) for forty-three different lamps, encompassing nine of the major types of lamps used worldwide. The narrow band emission spectra were used to simulate radiances in eight spectral bands including the human eye photoreceptor bands (photopic, scotopic, and “meltopic”) plus five spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared modeled on bands flown on the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). The high-resolution continuous spectra are superior to the broad band combinations for the identification of <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> and are the standard for calculation of Luminous Efficacy of Radiation (LER), Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and Color Rendering Index (CRI). Given the high cost that would be associated with building and flying a hyperspectral sensor with detection limits low enough to observe nighttime lights we conclude that it would be more feasible to fly an instrument with a limited number of broad spectral bands in the visible to near infrared. The best set of broad spectral bands among those tested is blue, green, red and NIR bands modeled on the band set flown on the Landsat Thematic Mapper. This set provides low errors on the identification of lighting types and reasonable estimates of LER and CCT when compared to the other broad band set tested. None of the broad band sets tested could make reasonable estimates of Luminous Efficacy (LE) or CRI. The photopic band proved useful for the estimation of LER. However, the three photoreceptor bands performed poorly in the identification of lighting types when compared to the bands modeled on the Landsat Thematic Mapper. Our conclusion is that it is feasible to identify <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> and make reasonable estimates of LER and CCT using four or more spectral bands with minimal spectral overlap spanning the 0. 4 to 1. 0 um region...|$|E

Building lighting systems is typically the first item evaluated by commercial and industrial energy auditors.

The paper presents a prototype system that can enumerate and classify the lighting in a building using an optical camera, accelerometer, spectrometer, and distance sensor. As the aerial vehicle navigates throughout a room, the prototype system captures images and collects frequency data of lighting. The system employs image recognition techniques to quantify lighting in each room. Using the unique frequency spectrum of each <b>lighting</b> <b>type,</b> the prototype system classifies the different types of lighting with the spectrometer.

40|$|Abstract Workplaces {{with good}} {{daylighting}} offer visual comfort to users, {{give them a}} series of physiological and psychological benefits and allow good performance of visual activities, besides saving energy. However, this solution is not always adopted: <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> preferences involve many variables besides the availability of daylight. This paper explores a case study through the analysis of questionnaire answers and computer simulations {{of a series of}} metrics related to quality of lighting with the aim of finding explanations for the lighting preferences of individual office users. The results show that, although the offices present good daylighting conditions and no glare potential, and users are satisfied with daylighting, these parameters are not sufficient to explain the predominant lighting preferences. The findings have also shown that there is no consensus about which parameters potentially cause visual comfort, while the parameters that cause discomfort are clearly identified. In addition, in this study, 49 % of the preference for mixed lighting (daylight plus electrical light) {{can be explained by the}} fact that mixed lighting produces better modeling than daylighting alone...|$|E

Instead, they rely on color as one of the major criteria to select beef cuts. During refrigerated display, fresh meat color changes and consumers discriminate against discolored meats.

A descriptive study was done. Twelve research professors participated: their age ranking between 25 to 55 years. The methodology used was of quality and participation nature (focusing on emic). The following activities were carried out: brainstorming from an investigation question, ranking and classifying the information, analyzing and interpreting data and determining the categories. The research participation techniques used were brainstorming and focal group. The risk factors identified by the focal team were: screen brightness, exposition time, <b>lighting,</b> <b>type</b> of monitor, size of screen, font type, font size, reader posture, colors used, quality of text printing, human factors and amicable software. The proposed categories by the participants were: equipment, material, environment and people.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Multispectral imagery (MSI) of Las Vegas, Nevada, were investigated {{to determine their}} potential for accurately mapping nocturnal lighting using a reference spectral library of lighting types. Nocturnal lighting classifications of International Space Station (ISS) astronaut color photography and 8 -, 6 -, and 4 -band MSI generated by modeling high spectral resolution hyperspectral imagery (HSI) data to lower spectral resolution were compared to lighting identification accomplished using the full resolution HSI spectral signatures. The results indicate that ISS imagery {{does not have the}} spectral resolution necessary to accurately distinguish between the emission features of outdoor lighting. The modeled multispectral band configurations demonstrated somewhat improved separation of certain lighting types by their spectral signatures, however, with only 8, 6, or 4 spectral bands, accurate discrimination of lighting types still remains a daunting task. While the different colors associated with outdoor lighting can be visually delineated in MSI data, the limited spectral information does not allow for accurate <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> classification because of the inability to identify specific sharp emission features. Mapping nocturnal lighting using MSI data does have some utility, and certainly would provide better spatial coverage, however, HSI remains the most accurate method to differentiate the emission features associated with urban outdoor lighting.

40|$|Introduction and Aims Insufficient {{lighting}} as {{a physical}} stressor in work environment may impact on work performance and cause work–related accidents. This study assessed the illumination and the probable effects on visual fatigue and mental states in Velaiat hospital’s personnel of Damghan. Materials and Methods A case study design performed in indoor hospital working areas. Layout and type of luminaires were examined and interior illuminations were measured as proposed by IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America). A questionnaire was used to collect data and descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were conducted. Results Interior lighting measurements showed unacceptable levels of local illumination in 82. 3 percent of sections during day light hours and all sections during night hours. General levels of illumination were unacceptable for 83. 3 percent of section in day light and all sections in night hours. Uniformity ratios were unacceptable during day and night hours for 91 percent and 83 percent of sections, respectively. There is a significant relation between age and perceived favorable light, visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). We found significant relationships between the <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> and illumination with visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Insufficient illumination and excessive artificial light may lead to visual fatigue and mental strain. Lighting design should account for acceptable quantity and similarity to daylight. * Corresponding Author: Research Center for Social Determinants of health, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

40|$|Energy {{benchmarking}} is {{an important}} step in evaluating a building’s energy use and comparing it with similar buildings in similar climates. Depending on the benchmarking results, extra measures can be taken to reduce energy consumption when the subject building has been assessed to consume more than other similar buildings. This study presents the current state of energy benchmarking-related research and available tools. An artificial neural networks (ANN) -based benchmarking technique is presented as a highly effective method. The model specifically focuses on predicting a weighted energy use index (EUI) by taking into consideration various building variables, such as plug load density, <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> and hours of operation, air conditioning equipment type and efficiency, etc. Data collected from laboratory, office and classroom-type buildings and mixed use buildings in Hawaii are used to present the ANN-based benchmarking technique. The developed model successfully predicted the benchmarking EUI for the buildings considered in the study. The model coefficient of correlation was 0. 86 for the whole building benchmarking analysis, indicating a good correlation between the measured EUI and the ANN predictions. Additionally, the use of ANN benchmark model for predicting potential energy savings from retrofit projects was evaluated. Some of the benchmarking input variables were modified to reflect a potential energy savings from a retrofit project and the new input set was simulated with the ANN model. The preliminary results show that the developed ANN model can be used to predict energy savings fro...|$|E

In the last years, the interest of researchers and business have been moved {{on the use of}} light emitting diodes (LEDs) such as an innovative artificial light source. LEDs technology is appreciate to be high efficient and to have a long lifetime. Moreover, LEDs have the possibility to emit light at a specific wavelength and are able to provide precise light quality and quantity to crops. To assess the effect of different artificial light supply on photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), an experiment was conducted in controlled conditions using two black chambers equipped respectively with LEDs and fluorescent lamps (fluora). Plants were divided into two groups on the basis of <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> plus a control with plants kept under natural lighting. Leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll content were recorded before, during and after the light treatments. Results pointed out both the species had a different photosynthetic response to LEDs and fluora. Negative gas exchange performances of common dandelion were recorded on both LEDs and fluora light supply. On the other hand, net assimilation, transpiration and stomatal resistance of purple coneflower were positively affected by fluora lighting. For both the species, SPAD values (correlated to chlorophyll content), after a first increase, has progressively reduced till the end of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of the ratio of cloud flashes to ground flashes may provide {{a better understanding of}} thunderstorm dynamics, intensification, and evolution, and it may be useful in severe weather warning. The National Lighting Detection Network TM (NLDN) senses ground flashes with exceptional detection efficiency and accuracy over most of the continental United States. A proposed Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) will look at the western hemisphere, and among the lightning data products to be made available will be the fundamental optical flash parameters for both cloud and ground flashes: radiance, area, duration, number of optical groups, and number of optical events. Previous studies have demonstrated that the optical flash parameter statistics of ground and cloud lightning, which are observable from space, are significantly different. This study investigates a Bayesian network methodology for discriminating lightning flash type (ground or cloud) using the lightning optical data and ancillary GOES-R data. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is set up with lightning as a "root" and data observed by GLM as the "leaves. " This allows for a direct calculation of the joint probability distribution function for the <b>lighting</b> <b>type</b> and radiance, area, etc. Initially, the conditional probabilities that will be required can be estimated from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) together with NLDN data. Directly manipulating the joint distribution will yield the conditional probability that a lightning flash is a ground flash given the evidence, which consists of the observed lightning optical data [and possibly cloud data retrieved from the GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) in a more mature Bayesian network configuration]. Later, actual GLM and NLDN data can be used to refine the estimates of the conditional probabilities used in the model; i. e., the Bayesian network is a learning network. Methods for efficient calculation of the conditional probabilities (e. g., an algorithm using junction trees), finding data conflicts, goodness of fit, and dealing with missing data will also be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Facing air {{pollution}} in large urban areas {{is one of the}} great challenges in health and environment protection. The use of photocatalytic products (Kaneko, 2002; Fujishima, 1999) may be an answer to such an issue. The main feature of these products, which generally contain titanium dioxide photocatalyst, lies in the ability to exploit both solar and suitable artificial light to induce chemical reactions which cause the destruction of surface adsorbed pollutants. This allows the removal of air pollutants and of organic compounds which would otherwise cause the progressive deterioration of buildings. The use of photocatalytic materials in confined environments may lead to an improvement of air quality in domestic, working and school environments, by the reduction of both organic and inorganic compounds (mainly converted to carbonic anhydride and inorganic salts, respectively), and of particulate (PM 10 and PM 2, 5). In order to obtain the best performance from the photocatalytic finishing, it is necessary to consider practical aspects such as room <b>lighting,</b> <b>type</b> and distance of the light sources, and air humidity as well. The work presented here is being performed within the framework of a research project of the University of Padova, named "Nanotechnologies for the building trade. New photocatalytic materials based on metal systems-modified titanium dioxide. Application to cement and glass-based materials.
