40|$|Most {{industrial}} production processes are performed in fed-batch operational mode. In contrast, the screenings for microbial production strains are run {{in batch mode}} which results in completely different physiological conditions than relevant for production. This may lead to wrong strain selections. Silicone elastomer discs containing glucose crystals were developed to realize fed-batch fermentation based on diffusion in shaken bioreactors. No other device for feeding was required. This “slow-release fed-batch technique” was tested on the metabolism of H. polymorpha, E. coli and G. oxydans in shake flasks. The OTR and RQ were monitored online with a RAMOS device. Biomass formation, synthesis of proteins like GFP or eYFP-IL- 6, pH drift and metabolic dynamics of glucose, ethanol, acetic acid and other organic acids were measured offline. By application of the slow-release fed-batch technique in comparison to regular batch mode, overflow-metabolism of H. polymorpha and E. coli could be reduced, which led {{to an increase in}} biomass yield of up to 85 % and 59 %, respectively. Up to date, 23. 4 g/L cell dry weight of H. polymorpha and 13. 7 g/L of E. coli was achieved. The specific biomass yields of 0. 38 - 0. 47 are in the magnitude of those in <b>laboratory</b> <b>fermentors</b> equipped with a substrate feed-pump. The GFP expression by H. polymorpha RB 11 pC 10 -GFP could be improved in Syn 6 -MES and YNB mineral media up to 35 -fold and 420 -fold, respectively. The synthesized maximum in fed-batch mode was 421 mg/L GFP. In contrast only up to 2. 5 mg/L GFP was received in batch mode. The expression of eYFP-IL- 6 by E. coli BL 21 pLys pRSET eYFP-IL 6 could be increased 4 -fold in optimized Wilms-MOPS mineral medium using the slow-release fed-batch technique. Slow-release fed-batch cultures of G. oxydans DSM 2003 revealed a 2. 6 -fold increase of specific biomass yield in modified Silberbach-MES complex medium. A cell dry weight of 3. 3 g/L was obtained in contrast to 1. 6 g/L in batch mode. Due to glucose feeding a reduction of gluconic acid as well as 2 - and 5 -ketogluconic acid formation was monitored. A mass screening of 265 H. polymorpha RB 11 pC 10 -FMD clones and 267 pC 10 -MOX clones was performed in Syn 6 -MES mineral medium in deep-well plates. A batch with glucose and one with glycerol were performed simultaneously in comparison to a slow-release fed-batch with glucose. One repetition screening was done under the same conditions. These diverse operational modes revealed great differences in strain selection and quality of specific GFP yield. The best strains for a fed-batch would be unlikely found in either batch mode. A dependence on the carbon source and the operational mode was found in relevance to the regulating promoter for gene expression.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{production}} of biomass enriched with carotenoids and ergosterol by yeast strain Rhodotorula glutinis CCY 20 - 2 - 26 grown under optimal growth conditions and in the presence of exogenous stress factors. R. glutinis cells were exposed to UV irradiation, oxidative stress (2 – 10 mmol/L H 2 O 2) and osmotic stress (2 – 10 % NaCl). During the experiment, growth characteristics and the production of biomass, carotenoids and ergosterol were evaluated. Experiments were carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks and in <b>laboratory</b> <b>fermentor.</b> First, R. glutinis cells were exposed to higher concentration of stress factors added into the production medium. Further, low concentrations of NaCl and H 2 O 2 were added to the inoculum medium or to both inoculum and production media. Exposure of red yeast cells to all tested stress factors resulted in higher production of carotenoids as well as ergosterol, while biomass production was changed only slightly. Under high stress, 2 – 3 times increase of β-carotene was observed. The addition of low salt or peroxide concentration into the inoculation media led to about 2 -fold increase of carotenoid production. In Erlenmeyer flasks the best effect on the carotenoid and ergosterol production (3 - to 4 -fold increase) was exhibited by the combined stress: the addition of low amount of NaCl (2 mmol/L) into the inoculum medium, followed by the addition of H 2 O 2 (5 mmol/L) into the production medium. The production of ergosterol in most cases increased simultaneously with the production of carotenoids. Cultivation of R. glutinis carried out in a 2 -litre <b>laboratory</b> <b>fermentor</b> was as follows: under optimal conditions about 37 g/L of yeast biomass were obtained containing approx. 26. 30 mg/L of total carotenoids and 7. 8 mg/L of ergosterol.

40|$|AbstractBioethanol is {{regarded}} as one of most demanding fuel as an alternative to fossil fuel as it is renewable and environment friendly. In industry, bioehanol is produced usually by using molasses as the carbon source with the help of S. cerevisiae. But due to steep hike in the prices of molasses, the production cost of biotehanol is on constant rise. Therefore, there is urgent need to evolve alternative strategy which can lower down the production cost of bioehanol. This study is directed towards finding out some rationale approaches which can increase the production rate of biotehanol, thereby decreasing the production cost. We have applied random mutagenesis approach by UV exposure for strain improvement of existing strain which is not alcohol tolerant. 25 minutes UV exposure to existing strain produced a mutant strain which produced 12 % (v/v) alcohol in fermentor whereas WT S. cerevisiae produced only 8 % (v/v). We have also attempted to register increase in alcohol production by adding of Zinc ion in alcohol producing media. It was standardized that 20 mM Zinc sulphate addition to YEPD broth resulted in maximum increase in alcohol production in shake flask. When 20 mM Zinc sulphate was added to fermentation broth in 2 litre <b>laboratory</b> based <b>fermentor,</b> it resulted in 13. 2 % (v/v) alcohol production as compared to 8 % (v/v) alcohol production by WT strain.

40|$|Stickwater, a {{by-product}} of the fish meal and oil industry, is an aqueous suspension of fish proteins, lipids, and other materials, and also contains soluble nonprotein nitrogen but not carbohydrate. It is usually partially evaporated by heat to a marketable form called "fish solubles," which is sold with an acid preservative as an animal feed supplement. However, fish solubles are only used to a limited extent in feeds, because the lipids of solubles (averages 11 %) are relatively prone to oxidative rancidity development. An investigation was undertaken to digest and/or stabilize lipids in stickwater by lipolytic fermentations and, at the same time, to attempt to increase the protein content as single cell protein.

Duplicate treatments were carried out and the results were evaluated in terms of productivity and fermentation yield. Statistical design (p-value< 0. 05) was analyzed using Statgraphics Centurion XV Corporate software. Treatments performed at 200 rpm and different air flow levels, did not show significant differences on acetification rate. At higher agitation speed and air flow rates, the productivity was high. The best yields were obtained at lower air flows levels and higher agitation speed. Temperature did not present statistically differences on studied variables. The best yield was obtained at 400 rpm and 0. 3 vvm at 25 °C. It can be concluded that agitation speed plays an important role for a better acetification rate however higher air flow rates causes less yields.

To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} a gene encoding for ATP-dependent NADH kinase (ATP:NADH 2 ′-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 86) has been identified. The enzyme has a predicted molecular weight of 49 kDa. We characterised the role of this NADH kinase by genomic integration of the putative gene AN 8837. 2 under a strong constitutive promoter. The physiological effects of overexpressed NADH kinase in combination with different aeration rates were studied in well-controlled glucose batch fermentations. Metabolite profiling and metabolic network analysis with [1 - 13 C] glucose were used for characterisation of the strains, and the results demonstrated that NADH kinase activity has paramount influence on growth physiology. Biomass yield on glucose and the maximum specific growth rate increased from 0. 47 g/g and 0. 22 h- 1 (wild type) to 0. 54 g/g and 0. 26 h- 1 (NADH kinase overexpressed), respectively. The results suggest that overexpression of NADH kinase improves the growth efficiency of the cell by increasing the access to NADPH.

When placed in the rumen of sheep, FGRF enhances mulga digestion; however, limited supplies of feral goats, the labour involved in locating and mustering goats, and likely variations in the microbial composition of FGRF between animals and localities make the production of an in vitro cultured inoculum a desirable alternative to enable widespread adoption.

An inoculum based on FGRF, and produced in vitro using a fermentor, is potentially valuable to grazing enterprises reliant on mulga-fed sheep. However, problems in generating a consistent inoculum need to be addressed before such an inoculum can be generally considered...|$|E
40|$|The mircrobiological {{transformation}} of progesterone {{by a local}} isolate of Cunninghamella echiiiulata using a <b>laboratory</b> <b>fermentor</b> was studied. Progresterone (10 - 50 g/ 1) wetted by Tween 80 was added to 48 -hour old culture and the transformation was left to proceed for 72 hours. Thereafter, the different transformation products were resolved chromatog-raphically. The identity of each product was established through the determination of m. p., mixed m. p., optical rotation and ultraviolet as well as infrared absorption spectra. A comparison of the R{ values of each product {{with that of the}} corresponding reference using different solvent systems as well as their colour expressed with two spray reagents, was used as a further proof for the identity of the isolated products. With all concentrations of progesterone tested, maximum yield of 17 ot -hydroxyprogesterone was obtained after 48 hours of fermentation Progesterone concentrations of 10 and 20 g/ 1 were almost quantitatively converted to the different transformation products after 72 hours of fermentation. Using a concentration of 20 g/ 1 and incubation period of 48 hours, the transformation product mixture consisted of unchanged progesterone (6 %), 17 o< -hydroxyprogesterone (54 %),llotrhydroxyprogesterone (29 %) and llo<;, 17 <^-dihydroxy-progesterone (2. 5 %). تم استخدام مخمر صناعي سعة 2 لتر لاختيار مقدرة الفطرة على تكوين هذه المادة في ظروف تشبه تلك المطبقة في الصناعة. وبدراسة تركيزات متعددة فن مادة البروجستيرون تتراوح ما بين 10 جرام /لتر إلى 50 جرام /لتر ، وجد أن أنسب التركيزات المختبرة هو تركيز 20 جرام من البروجستيرون لكل لترمن الوسط الغذائي ، حيث تم تحويل كل البووجستيرون المضاف إلى المشتقات المختلفة خلال 72 ساعة من بدء الاضافة. ووجد أن أعلى معدل لتكوين مادة 17 ألفا - هيدروكسي البروجستيرون كان بعد 48 ساعة من بدأ إضافة البروجستيرون. عند فصل المواد الناتجة من تحول البروجستيرون بواسطة الفطرة المستخدمة وذلك بواسطة أعمدة الفصل باستخدام مادة الالومينا وجد أن البروجستيرون يتحول إلى : 17 ألفا - هيدروكسي البروجستيرون (54 %) 11 ألفا - هيدروكسي البروجستيرون (29 %) 11 ألفا ، 17 ألفا - ثنائي هيدروكسي البروجستيرون (2. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Isotope ratio {{measurements}} of organometal(loid) species {{are of interest}} {{in order to determine}} isotope fractionation of the heavy metal(loid) s which can elucidate their pathways in the environment. We describe isotope ratio {{measurements of}} organoantimony using gas chromatography coupled to ICP-MS. We studied the influence of various parameters on the isotope ratio determination of the transient signal from trimethylstibine, using capillary gas chromatography coupled to both multicollector and time of flight ICP-MS with a simultaneous aspiration of aqueous samples creating wet plasma conditions. The influence of different mathematical models on the precision of the isotope ratio determination of transient signals was studied. The trapezium integration of full or half peak gave precisions of 0. 08 % and 0. 02 % using the MC-ICP-MS, whereas the ICP-TOF-MS gave values of around 0. 2 %. The multicollector ICP-MS used as a detector showed a chromatographic isotope fractionation of trimethylstibine. (CH 3) (3) Sb- 123 eluted earlier than (CH 3) (3) Sb- 121, with a shift of the 123 / 121 ratio of about 2 %. Two different approaches were attempted to correct instrumental mass bias effects in order to descriminate natural isotope fractionation. First, we introduced Cd and Sb in aqueous solution simultaneously with the GC carrier and ICP Ar gas flow. Secondly, we used a standard-sample bracketing approach using a gas standard introduced via the GC. Real samples from a <b>laboratory</b> sewage sludge <b>fermentor</b> were measured and isotope fractionation of the biologically produced trimethylstibine was observed (delta Sb- 123 + 10 and + 19 parts per thousand). The gas samples were analysed for timethylstibine co-eluting with volatile organic compounds using GC-MS. Chloroform was found to co-elute, but had no significant influence on the isotope ratio of antimony in timethylstibine analysed by GC-ICP-MS. Hence, there would be a strong indication that isotope fractionation takes place when antimony is methylated by anaerobic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: As bacteriocinas são substâncias protéicas produzidas por bactérias, com atividade bactericida e bacteriostática contra bactérias sensíveis. Estes compostos são produzidos por microrganismos gram-positivos e gram-negativos, incluindo as bactérias láticas. Estas bactérias são extensamente usadas no processamento de alimentos devido a sua contribuição na vida de prateleira, textura e propriedades organolépticas. Algumas cepas de enterococos podem produzir bacteriocinas ativas contra bactérias patogênicas, tal como a Listeria monocytogenes. As bacteriocinas produzidas por Enterococcus faecium e Enterococcus faecalis são peptídeos pequenos, hidrofóbicos e termoestáveis. Dentro deste contexto este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a produção de enterocina por E. faecium e E. faecalis. Inicialmente, as fermentações foram feitas em frascos Erlenmeyers, incubados a 37 °C por 24 h, para determinar as melhores condições de fonte de carbono (glicose, sacarose {{comercial}} ou açúcar mascavo), pHinicial (4, 0; 6, 0; 8, 0 ou 10, 0) e agitação (0 ou 200 rpm). O meio basal modificado sem glicose foi usado como meio base sendo complementado com diferentes fontes de carbono. Em um segundo estágio, os experimentos foram conduzidos em fermentador de bancada por 24 h. Durante as fermentações foram coletadas amostras em intervalos de 24 h ou 1 h, para a determinação da atividade de enterocina, massa celular seca, pH e conteúdo de açúcar. Os resultados obtidos a partir dos testes em frascos Erlenmeyers indicam que usando o E. faecium para produção de enterocina as melhores condições de cultivo foram pHinicial 10, 0, sacarose e sem agitação. A máxima produção de enterocina foi 2, 81 UE. Os resultados indicaram que as melhores condições para produção de enterocina usando E. faecalis foram pHinicial 10, 0, 200 rpm e açúcar mascavo, com atividade de enterocina de 1, 68 UE. No fermentador, a maior atividade de enterocina foi 2, 94 UE após 21 h de fermentação no experimento com pHinicial 10, 0, 200 rpm, sacarose e E. faecium. A atividade de enterocina foi de 1, 30 UE após 12 h de incubação no experimento com pHinicial 10, 0, 200 rpm, açúcar mascavo e E. faecalis. A L. monocytogenes Scott A foi utilizada como microrganismo teste e foi inibida pelas enterocinas produzidas por E. faecium e por E. faecalis. Abstract: Bacteriocins are {{protein substances}} produced by bacteria that are bactericidal or bacteriostatic against sensitive bacterial species. Both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including the lactic acid bacteria, produce these compounds. These bacteria are extensively used in food processing, for {{their contribution to}} shelf life, texture and organoleptic properties. Some strains of entecococci can produce bacteriocins active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocins produced by Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are small, hydrophobic and termostable peptides. The aim of this work was the study of enterocin production by E. faecium and E. faecalis. Initially, fermentations assays were carried out in Erlenmeyers flasks for determining the best conditions of carbon sources (glucose, sucrose and brown sugar), pHinitial (4, 0; 6, 0; 8, 0 or 10, 0) and agitation (0 or 200 rpm). The modified basal medium without glucose was used as base medium and the different carbon employed. The flasks incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. In a second stage, the experiments were carried out in <b>laboratory</b> scale <b>fermentor</b> for 24 h. During the fermentations samples were collected at intervals of 24 h or 1 h, for determination of enterocin activity, biomass (cell dry mass), pH and sugar contents. The first phase in Erlenmeyers flasks indicated that using E. faecium for enterocin production the best culture conditions were pHinitial 10, 0, sucrose and without agitation. The maximum enterocin production was 2, 81 UE. The {{results indicated that the}} best conditions for enterocin production using E. faecalis were pHinitial 10, 0, 200 rpm and brown sugar, with enterocin activity of 1, 68 UE. In fermentor the highest enterocin activity was 2, 94 UE after 21 h of fermentation in experiment using pHinitial 10, 0, 200 rpm, sucrose and E. faecium. The enterocin activity was 1, 30 UE after 12 h of incubation in experiment with pHinitial 10, 0, 200 rpm, brown sugar and E. faecalis. When it was used L. monocytogenes Scott A as microorganism test occurred its inhibition by enterocin of E. faecium and E. faecalis...|$|R
