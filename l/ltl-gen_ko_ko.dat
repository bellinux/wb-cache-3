40|$|It {{is known}} that the main {{components}} of the seed storage proteins contribute to the quality of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] food products. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate content of the two of them [glycinin (11 S) and β-conglycinin (7 S) fractions] and their respective subunits on the new high-protein soybean genotypes from the Institute for Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad, Serbia. Subunits were resolved by SDS-PAGE and gels were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Out of 20 analyzed genotypes, the β' and β subunits of β- conglycinin were significantly higher in all of the genotypes except <b>KO</b> 531 and <b>KO</b> 5431. The β subunit of β-conglycinin was significantly higher in genotypes <b>KO</b> 535 <b>KO</b> 5437, <b>KO</b> 534, <b>KO</b> 537, <b>KO</b> 539, <b>KO</b> 5439, <b>KO</b> 532, <b>KO</b> 5435, <b>KO</b> 538, <b>KO</b> 5438 and <b>KO</b> 533. The acetic polypeptides of glycinin were significantly higher in genotypes <b>KO</b> 5439, <b>KO</b> 5437, <b>KO</b> 5436, <b>KO</b> 5438, <b>KO</b> 5432, <b>KO</b> 5435, <b>KO</b> 5433 and <b>KO</b> 5434. The basic polypeptides of glycinin were not significantly higher only in genotypes <b>KO</b> 539, <b>KO</b> 536, <b>KO</b> 538, <b>KO</b> 535 and <b>KO</b> 533. In conclusion, it appears that among the new high-protein genotypes there are genotypes with different amount of subunits that should be bread in the future for a desired level of the protein components. ...|$|R
