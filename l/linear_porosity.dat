Small sub-samples from the resulting images are processed to generate feature-preserving, finite-volume meshes of high quality. All three foam samples exhibit similar volumetric porosity (in the range ~ 91 – 93 %), and thereby a similar thermal conductivity. Effective tortuosity for conduction along the coordinate directions is also calculated. Permeability simulations in the Darcy flow regime with {{air and water}} show that the foam permeability is isotropic and is {{of the order of}} 10 ^- 7 m^ 2.

Non-uniform airflow models for peaked, leveled, and inverted cone grain mass configurations were developed using the finite volume method. Airflow resistance due to porous media of grain material was implemented using Ergun’s equation and a <b>linear</b> <b>porosity</b> variation with low porosity {{at the center}} and maximum at the side. The velocity profile and heat transfer during aeration were quantified for the peaked, leveled and inverted cone grain mass configurations. The change in grain temperature in the inverted cone grain mass configuration was the fastest followed by the leveled and peaked configurations. It took 102, 114, and 186 h, respectively, for cored, leveled, and peaked grain mass configurations to cool the grain from 40 °C to below 20 °C. For the peaked cone volume, the model predicted an 84 -h delay in the cooling front movement (or about 55 %) compared to the inverted cone configuration.

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{scale formation}} {{is a well}} known problem for water producing wells. Although there are several types of scale forming processes, we investigate the case of calcium carbonate precipitation when the degassing of CO 2 causes the calcium equilibrium concentration to decrease towards a production well. We study a simplified system of carbonate chemistry, which allows for analytical expressions for the porosity loss {{as a function of}} time. The precipitation process normally goes from flow-limited away from the well to precipitation-limited close to the well. We derive an expression that estimates the transition zone between these two regimes. Furthermore, we present analytical estimates for the porosity reduction at a given radius as a function of time, including an estimate for each of these precipitation regimes. These analytical results are tested against numerical solutions for the porosity loss, which account for the full set of equations of the model. The analytical models give an accurate estimate of the <b>linear</b> <b>porosity</b> reduction with time, until at least half the porosity is lost. Examples of scale formation are given for the two regimes. Reasonable values for the precipitation kinetics indicate that most production operations have a kinetics-limited regime close to the well. The models also show that this type of scale formation takes place very close to the wells, typically within a few well radii from the walls of the well...|$|E

Many authors have tried {{to come up with}} a suitable and practical mathematical model. To analyze the production data of a shale reservoir correctly, an understanding and choosing the proper mathematical model is required. Therefore, three models (the homogeneous linear flow model, the transient <b>linear</b> dual <b>porosity</b> model, and the fully transient <b>linear</b> triple <b>porosity</b> model) will be studied and compared to provide correct interpretation guidelines for these models. The analytical solutions and interpretation guidelines are developed in this work to interpret the production data of shale reservoirs effectively. Verification and derivation of asymptotic and associated equations from the Laplace space for dual porosity and triple porosity models are performed in order to generate analysis equations. Theories and practical applications of the three models (the homogeneous linear flow model, the dual porosity model, and the triple porosity model) are presented. A simplified triple porosity model with practical analytical solutions is proposed in order to reduce its complexity. This research provides the interpretation guidelines with various analysis equations for different flow periods or different physical properties. From theoretical and field examples of interpretation, the possible errors are presented. Finally, the three models are compared in a production analysis with the assumption of infinite conductivity of hydraulic fractures...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} have been promoted due to improved breakthrough and increased commercialization. The assembly pressure {{put on a}} single cell and a fuel cell stack has important influence on the geometric deformation of the gas diffusion layers (GDLs) resulting in a change in porosity, permeability, and the resistance for heat and charge transfer in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this paper, both the finite {{element method and the}} finite volume method are used, respectively, to predict the GDL deformation and associated effects on the geometric parameters, porosity, mass transport property, and the cell performance. It is found that based on the isotropic Young's modulus and the finite element method, the porosity and thickness under a certain assembly pressure are non-homogeneous across the fuel cell in the in-plane direction. The variations of the porosity change and compression ratio in the cross-section plane are localized by three zones, that is, a <b>linear</b> <b>porosity</b> zone, a constant porosity zone, and a nonlinear porosity zone. The results showed that the GDL porosity and compression ratios maintain linear and nonlinear changes in the zone above the shoulders and the zone under the channel but close to the shoulder, respectively. However, a constant value is kept above the middle of the channel. The obtained non-homogeneous porosity distribution is applied together with the deformed GDL for further computational fluid dynamics analysis, in which the finite volume method is implemented. The computational fluid dynamic results reveal that a higher assembly pressure decreases the porosity, GDL thickness, gas flow channel cross-sectional areas, oxygen diffusion coefficient, oxygen concentration, and cell performance. The maximum oxygen mole fraction occurs where the maximum porosity exists. A sufficient GDL thickness is required to ensure transfer of fresh gas to the reaction sites far away from the channel. However, the reduction of porosity is a dominating factor that decreases the cell performance compared with the decreased gas channel flow area and GDL thickness in the assembly condition. Therefore, the assembly pressure should be balanced to consider both the cell performance and gas sealing security...|$|E

The scope of this project is mainly focused at the effect of sintering temperature and the different process of weight percentage sodium feldspar to Claytan porcelain. Slurry of Claytan porcelain mixed was prepared by agitator mixer. The sodium feldspar mixed with the Claytan porcelain according to the weight percentage of sodium feldspar to Claytan porcelain which is at 2 wt. %, 4 wt. %, 6 wt. %, 8 wt. % and 10 wt. %. Slip casting was used as the processing method. Sintering process was conducted at four different temperatures 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C and 1100 °C and was fixed for 1 hour and heating and cooling rate were at 10 °C/minute. DTA/TG was used in order to establish the firing condition. Physical analyses were divided into three analyses which were <b>linear</b> shrinkage, <b>porosity</b> and bulk density of the samples. It was carried out according to the specific ASTM standard of testing. The mechanical behavior was evaluated in term of modulus of rupture and micro hardness. After viewing the results, it can be concluded that percentage of porosity significantly reduces from 30. 16 % to 22. 83 % when sintered at 800 °C and 1100 °C for sodium feldspar 10 wt. %. Claytan porcelain with sodium feldspar 2 wt. % at 1100 oC exhibited the highest strength of 17. 59 Mpa and micro hardness value 150. 40 Hv.

If this difference, OM = M(P 1, 4)) — M(P 2, 4)), is plotted versus porosity for a suite of samples, then the scatter of OM is close to zero as porosity approaches the critical porosity value, and reaches its maximum as porosity approaches zero. The dependence of this scatter on porosity is close to <b>linear.</b> Critical <b>porosity</b> here is the porosity above which rock can exist only as a suspension—between 36 % and 40 % for sandstones. This stress-sensitivity pattern of grain-supported sandstones (clay content below 0. 35) practically does not depend on clay content.

This type curve was constructed based on transient production rate with constant well pressure in a closed boundary of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) with double porosity approach. In order to analyse the early production data we used Bello's and Nobakht's approach to account for apparent skin. In this study, three flow regimes were identified consisting of 1 - bilinear flow; 2 - matrix linear flow; and 3 - boundary dominated flow. For the analysis of early flow regime, two possibilities of transition flow and apparent skin have been considered. First, the fracture permeability was estimated to be around 820 nano Darcy based on transition flow analysis. Second, the matrix permeability was estimated to be either 181 or 255 nano Darcy based on two different approaches in matrix linear flow regime. Furthermore, original gas in place (OGIP) and SRV were estimated from the boundary dominated flow regime. To validate the estimated matrix permeability, a single porosity numerical model with high permeability transverse fractures was built to match the production history. The permeability from simulation was in a good agreement with type curve analysis. Production forecasting has also been carried out using different adsorption isotherms. The results showed that the effect of desorption depends on the reservoir pressure and the shape of adsorption isotherm curve. In early time of production, desorption is usually not effective, however, for long-term production forecasting, it is necessary to account for this phenomenon by providing an accurate isotherm.

40|$|Bioactive {{glasses of}} {{chemical}} composition 48. 4 SiO 2 - 23. 8 Na 2 O- 23. 8 CaO- 4. 0 P 2 O 5 wt% was prepared through Sol-Gel route. It was then crystallized through thermal treatment. Porous {{samples of the}} mentioned composition using Naphthalene (0, 30, and 50 weight percentage) as pore former were made and tested for Bulk Density, Apparent <b>porosity,</b> <b>Linear</b> Shrinkage, Cold Crushing Strength, and Bi-axial flexural strength. Maximum porosity of 50 % was obtained by this process. The maximum value of CCS obtained was 7. 8 MPa without any pore former and a minimum of 2. 3 MPa for 50 % Naphthalene. The Bi-axial flexural strength varied between the extremes of 16. 3 MPa and 5. 6 MPa. Their pore size distribution was also studied to ensure the presence of pores with size greater than 100 µm, {{which happens to be}} the critical lower limit for Angiogenesis. Samples were also prepared with a radial porosity gradient similar to the structure of the cancellous part of the Bone structure. The samples contained a central core of higher porosity and a outer concentric ring of lower porosity. These samples were also tested for the above mentioned mechanical properties. The Bioactivity of the samples was also studied by immersing them in a SBF solution for a period of 1, 3, and 7 days. These samples were then studied using XRD, SEM, EDX, and FTIR and showed significant formation of HCA ensuring their Bioactivity...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 27 th Mar 2018. The effect of pore size and {{porosity}} on elastic modulus, strength, cell attachment and cell proliferation was studied for Ti porous scaffolds manufactured via powder metallurgy and sintering. Porous scaffolds were prepared in two ranges of porosities {{so that their}} mechanical properties could mimic those of cortical and trabecular bone respectively. Space-holder engineered pore size distributions were carefully determined to study the impact that small changes in pore size may have on mechanical and biological behaviour. The Young’s moduli and compressive strengths were correlated with the relative <b>porosity.</b> <b>Linear,</b> power and exponential regressions were studied to confirm the predictability in the characterisation of the manufactured scaffolds and therefore establish them as a design tool for customisation of devices to suit patients’ needs. The correlations were stronger for the linear and the power law regressions and poor for the exponential regressions. The optimal pore microarchitecture (i. e. pore size and porosity) for scaffolds {{to be used in}} bone grafting for cortical bone was set to < 212 μm with volumetric porosity values of 27 - 37 %, and for trabecular tissues to 300 - 500 μm with volumetric porosity values of 54 - 58 %. The pore size range 212 - 300 μm with volumetric porosity values of 38 - 56 % was reported as the least favourable to cell proliferation in the longitudinal study of 12 days of incubation...|$|R
