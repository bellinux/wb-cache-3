500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|Among the new {{styles and}} forms in Auden's later work were the haiku and tanka {{that he began}} writing after {{translating}} the haiku and other verse in Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's Markings. A sequence of fifteen poems about his house in Austria, [...] "Thanksgiving for a Habitat" [...] (written in various styles that included an imitation of William Carlos Williams) appeared in About the House (1965), together with other poems that included his reflection on his lecture tours, [...] "On the Circuit". In the late 1960s he wrote {{some of his most}} vigorous poems, including [...] "River Profile" [...] and two poems that <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> his life, [...] "Prologue at Sixty" [...] and [...] "Forty Years On". All these appeared in City Without Walls (1969). His lifelong passion for Icelandic legend culminated in his verse translation of The Elder Edda (1969). Among his later themes was the [...] "religionless Christianity" [...] he learned partly from Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the dedicatee of his poem [...] "Friday's Child." ...|$|E

In 1993, the episodes with restored colour (see [...] "Broadcast and reception", above) were released on VHS. A DVD of the serial was released on 19 March 2012, featuring improved sound and picture restoration. The DVD included an audio commentary, on-screen text notes, a retrospective documentary [...] "The Devil Rides Out" [...] in which cast & crew looked back on the making of the serial, and an obituary documentary [...] "Remembering Barry Letts" [...] in which family and colleagues <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the life and work of the noted writer/producer/director. The documentary included extensive contributions from Letts himself, from a long interview he conducted with producer Ed Stradling in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|One {{issue at}} the start of Infinites {{development}} was reassembling the Irrational team. 2K had moved some of Levine's team, including Jon Chey, to 2K Marin to help develop BioShock 2. Levine had considered he and Chey to be [...] "the yin and yang of the organization", with Chey handling production matters while Levine worked on the creative side. As such, Levine had to find people to help replace these absences, but felt that he never really had rebuilt Irrational for development of Infinite, and there was a schism in the company throughout the development period. The larger expectations of Infinite required Levine to manage a team of 150 developers, which {{he was not able to}} get to know personally as he had been able to for BioShock. The stress of having many more responsibilities with the larger team took its toll on Levine. After the game was released, Levine had <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the past five years and found how much he had aged, and believed the period had affected his health and his personal relationships. Instead of staying on to build an even better game, Levine opted to leave Irrational Games, and started a separate smaller project.|$|E
