However, researches {{related to the}} thermal conductivity of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> is limited. The <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> are the main raw materials of lightweight construction material. In addition, the usability of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> as core material has been investigated in recent years. Thermal conductivity of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> significantly affects the thermal insulation performance of such composites. The thermal conductivity coefficients of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> are related {{to many of the}} physical properties of aggregates such as specific gravity, porosity, particle size etc. In this study, the effects of loose unit weight, the volume of aggregate matrix, porosity and grain size on the thermal conductivity of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> was investigated. Limestone aggregate (normal aggregate) was also used for comparison in the study. At first, all of the aggregates were divided into 4 different grain groups (2 - 1 mm, 1 - 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 - 0. 1 mm and < 0. 1 mm). The specific gravity, oven-dry particle density and loose unit weight values of aggregates were determined according to TS 699 and TS EN 1097 - 6 standards for each grain group, then the open and closed pore rates of aggregates were calculated with obtained data. Next, the aggregates were dried up until it reached a constant weight. Afterwards, the thermal conductivity coefficients at atmospheric pressure of the <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> were measured according to the TS EN 12664 standard. By analyzing data, the thermal conductivity coefficients of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> were associated with their physical properties. As a result, an empirical formula was proposed in order to estimate the thermal conductivity coefficient depending on the physical properties of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{assesses the}} {{possible}} use of Korat clays, deposited at Suranaree University of Technology (SUT), {{for the production}} of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The SUT clays were collected and divided into 2 groups, i. e. white clay and reddish brown clay, to study their heat-treatment behavior. The SUT clay mixtures in various ratios were investigated to find the suitable compositions and heat-treatment (between 1000 and 1250 °C) {{for the production of}} <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates.</b> After firing at 1250 °C, the SUT clays expanded 21. 05 and 5. 70 % for the white and reddish brown clays, respectively. Firing expansion was mainly dependent on the amount of SiO 2, fluxing oxides and water of the raw materials. These aggregates are highly impervious to water and exhibit considerable firing expansion, low bulk density (1. 29 - 1. 76 g/cm 3) and fair technical properties (unit weight and bending strength) for lightweight concrete. These results encourage the use of these clays for the production of <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R

Expanded-glass <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> were used in this study as the lightweight material. The mix design was developed applying the packing theory using the modified Andreasen and Andersen model to obtain the optimal grading curve of all the solids in the mixture. Two self-compacting and one conventionally vibrated mortar were designed. The developed mortars had a low thermal conductivity while retaining good mechanical properties. The permeability of the developed mortars was quantified based on the measurements of the capillary water absorption, water penetration under pressure and chloride transport properties. The results of the tests indicate that the produced self-compacting mortars are very permeable, while the permeability of the vibrated mortar is very low. When fine fractions of the <b>lightweight</b> <b>aggregates</b> were used, the produced composites were very permeable.
