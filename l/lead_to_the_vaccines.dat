40|$|Introduction The role {{accomplished}} by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules in initiating and regulating immune responses, binding short peptides and displaysp {{them on the}} cell surface for recognition by the T-cell receptors, is {{of the utmost importance}} in immunology. While binding of a peptide <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MHC molecule is a requirement for the recognition process, not all peptides bind to any given molecule belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MHCfamily. Thus, <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> fundamental processes involved in immunity it isnecessary to identify and determine whether certain peptide binds or not to an MHC molecule. This determination can then <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>vaccines</b> and immuno-therapeutic drugs which can be directed to combat autoimmune diseases and cancer [3, 4,].

50|$|The {{medical field}} also {{benefits}} {{from the study of}} comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as reverse vaccinology, researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens. Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>vaccines</b> that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for Group B Streptococcus, a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection. Comparative genomics {{can also be used to}} generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.|$|R
40|$|Vaccination {{has been}} deemed the most {{cost-effective}} way to fight against preventable diseases and improve global health. In recent years, expensive combination vaccines which provide multiple antigens in a single shot {{have been developed to}} replace traditional monovalent vaccines and have become the preferred choice of healthcare systems in industrialized countries. High prices have not only barricaded low-income countries from accessing combination vaccines but also lure vaccine manufacturers to shift their production capacity from making traditional vaccines to combination vaccines.

40|$|THESIS 10812 While the {{majority}} of human pathogens infect the body through mucosal sites, most licenced vaccines are injectable. In fact <b>the</b> only mucosal <b>vaccine</b> that is widely used for infant and childhood vaccination programs is <b>the</b> oral polio <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin in the 1950 s.

Mucosal vaccines elicit protective immunity at the gut mucosa, in part via antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). This explains the low efficacy of injectable cholera vaccines, which have been abandoned in favour of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs). However, oral vaccines face many challenges including passage through the acidic environment of the stomach followed by the proteolytic environment of the duodenum which can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destruction of <b>vaccines.</b> <b>The</b> gut innate immune system is also difficult to activate due to its predisposition towards hyporesponsiveness and tolerance.

40|$|AbstractHookworm {{infection}} {{is one of}} the world's most common neglected tropical diseases and a leading cause of iron deficiency anemia in low- and middle-income countries. A Human Hookworm Vaccine is currently being developed by <b>the</b> Sabin <b>Vaccine</b> Institute and is in phase 1 clinical testing. <b>The</b> candidate <b>vaccine</b> is comprised of two recombinant antigens known as Na-GST- 1 and Na-APR- 1, each of which is an important parasite enzyme required for hookworms to successfully utilize host blood as a source of energy. The recombinant proteins are formulated on Alhydrogel® and are being tested in combination with a synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 agonist.

50|$|From the 1760s, {{a number}} of individuals, {{including}} John Fewster, Peter Plett, Benjamin Jesty, and particularly Edward Jenner, {{were interested in the}} use of material from cowpox, an animal infection, to protect against smallpox. In 1796, Jenner vaccinated James Phipps, did more vaccinations in 1798, and was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> publish evidence that cowpox protected against smallpox, was safer than variolation, and that his vaccine could be maintained by arm-to-arm transfer. The use of variolation soon began <b>to</b> decline as <b>the</b> smallpox <b>vaccine</b> became widely used and its benefits appreciated. Various countries made variolation illegal, starting with Russia in 1805. Variolation served as a natural precursor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discovery of vaccination. The major differences between the two were that in vaccination, material from cowpox, an animal disease, was used, but particularly that it was safe to those vaccinated and was not transmitted to their contacts. Vaccination offered the public a less-harmful method of preventing smallpox. Vaccination would revolutionize the control of smallpox, leading to its eventual eradication. The extension of the principle of vaccination by Pasteur and his successors would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>vaccines</b> for diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza, and make the eradication of infectious diseases, particularly poliomyelitis, a realistic prospect.|$|R

40|$|More than 90 capsular serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae coexist despite {{competing}} for nasopharyngeal carriage and a gradient in fitness. The underlying mechanisms for this are poorly understood and make {{assessment of the}} likely population impact of vaccination challenging. We use an individual- based simulation model to generalize widely used deterministic models for pneumococcal competition and show that in these models short-term serotype-specific and serotype non-specific immunity could constitute the mechanism governing between-host competition and coexistence. We find that non-specific immunity induces between-host competition and that serotype- specific immunity limits a type’s competitive advantage and allows stable coexistence of multiple serotypes. Serotypes carried at low prevalence show high variance in carriage levels, which would result in apparent outbreaks if they were highly pathogenic. Vaccination against few serotypes can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> elimination of <b>the</b> <b>vaccine</b> types and induces replacement by others. However, in simulations where {{the elimination of the}} targeted types is achieved only by a combination of <b>vaccine</b> effects and <b>the</b> competitive pressure of the non-vaccine types, a universal vaccine with similar-type-specific effectiveness can fail to eliminate pneumococcal carriage and offers limited herd immunity. Hence, if vaccine effects are insufficient <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> majority of serotypes at the same time, then exploiting the competitive pressure by selective vaccination can help control the most pathogenic serotypes...|$|R
40|$|An ideal {{vaccine is}} {{relatively}} easy to define, but few real <b>vaccines</b> approach <b>the</b> ideal and no vaccines exist for many organisms, for which a <b>vaccine</b> is <b>the</b> only realistic protective strategy in the foreseeable future.

All micro-organisms deploy evasion mechanisms that interfere with effective immune responses and, for many organisms, it is not clear which immune responses provide effective protection. However, recent advances in methods for studying immune response to pathogens have provided a better understanding of immune mechanisms, including immunological memory, and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realisation that the initiation of immune responses is a key event requiring triggering through ‘danger’ signals.

40|$|Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) are {{important}} candidates {{for an alternative}} vaccine against pneumococcal infections. Since these antigens show variability, the use of variants that do not afford broad protection may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> selection of <b>vaccine</b> escape bacteria. Epitopes capable of inducing antibodies with broad cross-reactivities should thus be the preferred antigens. In this work, experiments using peptide arrays show that most linear epitopes recognized by antibodies induced in mice against different PspAs were located at the initial 44 amino acids of the mature protein and that antibodies against these linear epitopes did not confer protection against a lethal challenge. Conversely, linear epitopes recognized by antibodies <b>to</b> PspC included <b>the</b> consensus sequences involved in the interaction with human factor H and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA).

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus infections, {{particularly}} those from methicillin-resistant strains (i. e., MRSA), are reaching epidemic proportions, with no effective <b>vaccine</b> available. <b>The</b> vast number and transient expression of virulence {{factors in the}} infectious course of this pathogen have made the discovery of protective antigens particularly difficult. In addition, the divergent planktonic and biofilm modes of growth with their accompanying proteomic changes also demonstrate significant hindrances to vaccine development. In this study, a multicomponent vaccine was evaluated {{for its ability to}} clear a staphylococcal biofilm infection. Antigens (glucosaminidase, an ABC transporter lipoprotein, a conserved hypothetical protein, and a conserved lipoprotein) were chosen since they were found in previous studies to have upregulated and sustained expression in a biofilm, both in vitro and in vivo. Antibodies against these antigens were first used in microscopy studies to localize their expression in in vitro biofilms. Each of the four antigens showed heterogeneous production in various locations within the complex biofilm community in the biofilm. Based upon these studies, the four antigens were delivered simultaneously as a quadrivalent vaccine in order to compensate for this varied production. In addition, antibiotic treatment was also administered <b>to</b> clear <b>the</b> remaining nonattached planktonic cells since <b>the</b> <b>vaccine</b> antigens may have been biofilm specific. The results demonstrated that when vaccination was coupled with vancomycin treatment in a biofilm model of chronic osteomyelitis in rabbits, clinical and radiographic signs of infection significantly reduced by 67 and 82 %, respectively, compared to infected animals that were either treated with vancomycin or left untreated. In contrast, vaccination alone resulted in a modest, and nonsignificant, decrease in clinical (34 % reduction) and radiographic signs (9 % reduction) of infection, compared to nonvaccinated animal groups untreated or treated with vancomycin. Lastly, MRSA biofilm infections were significantly cleared in 87. 5 % of vaccinated and antibiotic-treated animals, while antibiotics or vaccine alone could not significantly clear infection compared to controls (55. 6, 22. 2, and 33. 3 % clearance rates, respectively).
