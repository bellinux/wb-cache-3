25|$|The {{reactions}} {{are due to}} collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules are, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> collide and react with one another. Thus, {{an increase in the}} concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).|$|E
25|$|Genetic linkage is the {{tendency}} of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other {{are unlikely to be}} separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E

The results of multiple regression analyses indicate that doctors’ emotional appraisal&positive regulation appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only significant negative predictor of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization whereas doctors’ empathic sensitivity and emotional appraisal&positive regulation are both significant predictor of personal accomplishment. Finally, the only significant demographic difference was found in doctors’ emotional intelligence and burnout with respect to marital status. The findings of this study provide crucial contribution to extending the body of literature and knowledge related with emotionally intelligent health care professionals that influences their burnout levels...|$|R
25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this {{has come to be}} known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Unlike normal gameplay, {{where all}} {{character}} and background graphics are two-dimensional (2D), combat is rendered entirely in 3D.

50|$|The {{amphibian}} chytrid fungus {{appears to}} grow best between 17 and 25 °C, and exposure of infected frogs to high temperatures can cure the frogs.

This may explain why chytridiomycosis-induced amphibian declines have occurred primarily at higher elevations and during cooler months. Naturally produced cutaneous peptides can inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis when the infected amphibians are around temperatures near 10 °C (50 °F), allowing species like the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) to clear the infection in about 15% of cases.|$|R

2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, {{there is something about}} constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people {{out of a sense of}} hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him." ...|$|E
60|$|There was hugely {{more sense}} in the old people who said that a wife and husband {{ought to have the}} same {{religion}} than there is in all the contemporary gushing about sister souls and kindred spirits and auras of identical colour. As a matter of fact, the more the sexes are in violent contrast the less <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be in violent collision. The more incompatible their tempers are the better. Obviously a wife's soul cannot possibly be a sister soul. It is very seldom so much as a first cousin. There are very few marriages of identical taste and temperament; they are generally unhappy. But to have the same fundamental theory, to think the same thing a virtue, whether you practise or neglect it, to think the same thing a sin, whether you punish or pardon or laugh at it, in the last extremity to call the same thing duty and the same thing disgrace&mdash;this really is necessary to a tolerably happy marriage; and it is much better represented by a common religion than it is by affinities and auras. And what applies to the family applies to the nation. A nation with a root religion will be tolerant. A nation with no religion will be bigoted. Lastly, the worst effect of all is this: that when men come together to profess a creed, they come courageously, though it is to hide in catacombs and caves. But when they come together in a clique they come sneakishly, eschewing all change or disagreement, though it is to dine to a brass band in a big London hotel. For birds of a feather flock together, but birds of the white feather most of all.|$|E

40|$|When given a choice, how {{do people}} decide which {{physician}} to select? Although significant {{research has demonstrated that}} how people actually feel (their “actual affect”) influences their health care preferences, how people ideally want to feel (their “ideal affect”) may play an even greater role. Specifically, we predicted that people trust physicians whose affective characteristics match their ideal affect, which leads people to prefer those physicians more. Consistent with this prediction, the more participants wanted to feel high arousal positive states on average ([ideal HAP]; e. g., excited), the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> select a HAP-focused physician. Similarly, the more people wanted to feel low arousal positive states on average ([ideal LAP]; e. g., calm), the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> select a LAP-focused physician. Also as predicted, these links were mediated by perceived physician trustworthiness. Notably, while participants’ ideal affect predicted physician preference, actual affect (how much people actually felt HAP and LAP on average) did not. These findings suggest that people base even serious decisions on how they want to feel and highlight the importance of considering ideal affect in models of decision making, person perception, and patient physician communication...|$|R

This dissertation used a conceptual design to explore the effect of independent variables on Latina/o students' success. The following hypotheses were tested at the. 05 confidence level: (1) The higher the level of Latina/o students' college preparation, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (2) the higher the Latina/o students' level of motivation, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (3) the higher the level of Latina/o students' involvement in ethnic organizations, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (4) the higher the moral support given to Latina/o students, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (5) the higher the Latina/o students' perceptions of university support, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (6) the higher the Latina/o students' level of financial support, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (7) the higher the Latina/o students' level of acculturation into American society, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (8) the higher the Latina/o students' level of integration into American society, the more <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (9) the more hours Latina/o students work, the less <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (10) the more family, relationship, or health crises during school year, the less <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> succeed; (11) the higher the academic classification, the more likely Latina/o students <b>are</b> <b>to</b> succeed; and (12) a Latina student versus a Latino student <b>is</b> more likely <b>to</b> succeed. The dependent variable was the success of Latina/o students as indicated by their cumulative grade point averages (CUMGPA). The relationship between the independent and the dependent variables was investigated through a 65 -item survey. The population for this study included all undergraduate Latina/o students enrolled at Northern Illinois University from the 1993 fall semester through the 1998 spring semester. The 1321 surveys were distributed during fall semester 1998. Participants returned 412 usable surveys, which represents a 31 % return rate. Data generated from the instrument were collected and analyzed using statistical procedures: Bivariate and Multiple regressions. As a result of this study, a model for Latina/o student retention has been developed. Through step-wise regression, a final set of ten independent variables was selected that had a statistically significant relationship with CUMGPA: Academic Classification [...] -Hypothesis 11 (positive), Scholarship [...] -Hypothesis 6 (positive), Subjective Evaluation of Preparation [...] -Hypothesis 1 (positive), Missed Classes [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Semester GPA Below 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Subjective Evaluation of Readiness for College [...] -Hypothesis 2 (positive), Go to Community College if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Would Repeat Courses if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Ethnic Mix of Friends [...] -Hypothesis 8 (positive as mix move toward All Anglo), and Ethnic Identity/Support [...] -Hypothesis 3 (negative). The final Best-Fit model explained 47 % of the variance in Latina/o CUMGPA. Previous academic preparation was the strongest predictor of success. However, students more immersed in Latina/o organizations did not achieve the same level of success of those students less involved. Also, these factors must be investigated for their impact on retention, not just success. Students with a lower CUMGPA can remain enrolled and graduate, as long as they maintain the minimum GPA.
