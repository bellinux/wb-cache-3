25|$|Mora {{found the}} brief to be “a wholly {{inadequate}} {{analysis of the}} law” and that the approved request was “fatally grounded on these serious failures of legal analysis” because it provided no bright <b>line</b> <b>standard</b> for what techniques would be prohibited; the techniques it approved “could produce effects reaching the level of torture”; and that “even if the techniques as applied did not reach the level of torture, they almost certainly would constitute 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment'”, and either way would be unlawful.|$|E
25|$|From Oslo {{the line}} was {{originally}} planned to run from Oslo West Station around to Grorud and then head north, in a curve around town. This plan was abandoned on 22 July 1895, when Parliament decided that it should run from Oslo East Station (OsloØ) and via Maridalen. Construction commenced in November. The line was built with a trunk <b>line</b> <b>standard,</b> with 30kilograms per meter (60lb/yd) track. The first section of the line, the Gjøvik Line (then known as the North Line) from Grefsen to Jaren and the Røykenvik Line opened on 18 December 1900. The Alna Line opened on 20 January 1901.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{existing}} facilities and the site's strategic importance, {{the site was}} selected for a Maginot ouvrage in 1926. Work began in 1931, abandoning {{some of the older}} work and creating new underground facilities to the Maginot <b>Line</b> <b>standard.</b> A gallery connected the new position to the Séré de Rivières works. Work stopped in July 1935 {{as a result of the}} Stresa Front agreement with Italy, but restarted in 1938 as relations with Italy and Germany deteriorated. The cost of the new work amounted to 10.3 million francs (not including armament). When the position was occupied in 1938, numerous deficiencies in heat, ventilation and optical sighting equipment were uncovered.|$|E
25|$|After Cowherd's {{death in}} 1881 which {{resulted}} in the closure of his Brantford factory, a mechanical production department was created within the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and production of Canadian telephones and telephone equipment was transferred to Montreal in 1882, due to restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the United States. In addition to phones, four years later, the department started manufacturing its first switchboard, a 50 <b>line</b> <b>Standard</b> Magneto Switchboard. The small manufacturing department expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of the telephone to 50 employees in 1888. By 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees, and a new factory was under construction.|$|E
500|$|In {{the field}} of radio {{frequency}} (RF) and microwave engineering, by {{far and away the}} most common transmission <b>line</b> <b>standard</b> is 50 Ω coaxial cable (coax), which is an unbalanced line. 50Ω first arose as a nominal impedance during World War II work on radar and is a compromise between two requirements. [...] This standard was the work of the wartime US joint Army-Navy RF Cable Coordinating Committee. [...] The first requirement is for minimum loss. [...] The loss of coaxial cable is given by, ...|$|E
5|$|Maintenance {{remained}} mostly manual {{until the}} 1960s, after which a major rationalization plan shifted this work to machines. This allowed the <b>line's</b> <b>standard</b> to increase, allowing for heavier and faster trains. Hegra, Sona and Flornes Stations were made unmanned in 1970.|$|R
50|$|By 1913 it was {{realised}} {{that the}} substantial investment put into building {{a line to}} main <b>line</b> <b>standards</b> would never be repaid on the light local traffic. The line was then reduced to a single-track line on 13 July 1913.|$|R
25|$|Tangent and secant <b>lines</b> (<b>standard</b> <b>lines)</b> are {{represented}} undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, {{it is called}} a standard parallel. The central meridian is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written λ) and a parallel of origin (usually written φ) are often used to define {{the origin of the}} map projection.|$|R
500|$|Trade {{through the}} East Indies was a vital {{component}} of the economy of Great Britain during the late eighteenth century. The East India Company, which maintained trading ports throughout the region, most notably in British India at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, had a legal monopoly on the trade. The bulk of this was carried on large merchant ships known as East Indiamen, which had burthens between 500 and 1200 tons (bm), and carried up to 36 cannon. Due to their size and weaponry they could be mistaken for ships of the <b>line,</b> <b>standard</b> large warships of the period, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon. Despite their appearance however they could not fight off an enemy frigate or ship of the line as their guns were lighter in weight and weight of shot than those of similarly-sized warships, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship, and largely composed of lascars.|$|E
2500|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} {{appeared on the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1925 and on the New York Central in 1927. Since then, {{diesel locomotive}}s {{began to appear in}} mainline service in the United States in the mid-1930s. The diesel engines reduced maintenance costs dramatically, while increasing locomotive availability. On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over [...] a year, compared with about [...] for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed dieselisation in the US. In 1949 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad became the first large mainline railroad to convert completely to diesel locomotives, and Life Magazine ran an article on 5 December 1949 titled [...] "The GM puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major US railroad to dieselize 100%". The Susquehanna was one of the earliest railroads in America to fully dieselize by 1947 and retiring their steam locomotives by 1949. The final 2-8-4 Berkshire built in the world was Nickle Plate Road's 779 built in 1949. [...] The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. In Spring of 1960, Norfolk and Western Y6b 2190 and S1 290 doused their fires for the last time in a Williamson, West Virginia roundhouse. The Age of Steam was over that ended steam locomotive common carrier service in the United States. 1960 is normally considered the final year of regular Class 1 main <b>line</b> <b>standard</b> gauge steam operation in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in Maine. Union Pacific did not retire their final steam locomotives however, until 1963 and 1964 respectively. Within the 10 year period between 1960 and 1970, 47,000 common carrier steam locomotives were replaced by over 30,000 more modern, sleek-looking diesels. Full USA dieselization was finally achieved by 1971 starting a new chapter in American Railroading.|$|E
