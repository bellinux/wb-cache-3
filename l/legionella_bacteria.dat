40|$|Legionellosis is {{an acute}} {{respiratory}} and lung disease caused by bacteria {{of the genus}} Legionella. Natural and manmade aquatic environments are the major reservoirs of Legionellae. Transmission to humans occurs through inhalation of infectious aerosols. 104 samples of water intended primarily for the cooling process in flat glass factories were examined. All samples contained varying amounts of the <b>legionellae</b> <b>bacteria</b> which are pathogenic for humans. The most serious finding was Legionella pneumophila sg. 1, sbg. Pontiac. Saprophytic strains (L. rubrilucens, L. nautarum, L. worsleiensis) were also found. An increased risk of the disease is associated mainly with the operation, maintenance and cleaning of machines (grinders, washers) and cooling systems. Preventive methods include regular maintenance, the disinfection of cooling water with biocides and the implementation of risk assessment. Medical diagnosis is based on medical examinations of workers supported by specific tests used above all in cases of professionally acquired pneumonia. This will also lead to improvement of the legionellosis surveillance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Legionella</b> <b>bacterium,</b> an {{intracellular}} pathogen of mononuclear phagocytes, causes acute fatal pneumonia, {{especially in}} patients with impaired cellular immune responses. Until recently, however, the toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement of bacterial proteins derived from Legionella is uncertain. We previously showed that a 19 -kDa highly conserved peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of Legionella pneumophila induced the PAL-specific B cell and T cell responses in mice. In this study, we observed that the rPAL antigen of L. pneumophila, as an effector molecule, activated murine macrophages via TLR 2 and produced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL- 6 and TNF-α. In both BALB/c and TLR 4 -deficient C 3 H/HeJ mice, pretreatment of macrophages with anti-TLR 2 mAb showed severely impaired cytokine production {{in response to the}} rPAL. In addition, in vitro the rPAL treatment increased the cell surface expression of CD 40, CD 80, CD 86 and MHC I/II molecules. We further showed that the synthetic CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) coadministered with the rPAL enhanced IL- 12 and IL- 6 production and expression of CD 40, CD 80 and MHC II compared to the rPAL treatment alone. In conclusions, these results indicate that Legionella PAL might activate macrophages via a TLR 2 -dependent mechanism which thus induce cytokine production and expression of costimulatory and MHC molecules...|$|R

40|$|This diploma work covers an {{investigation}} over the heat - and hot water {{systems of the}} tenant-owner's association, Bogården. The heat - and hot water needs of Bogården are satisfied by both district heating as well as three heat pumps. Implemented investigation shows that the heat pumps are not used in a profitable way. Apart from that, the reserve possibilities are small. There is also a risk {{of the growth of}} <b>Legionella</b> <b>bacterium</b> in the hot water system. Since the heat pumps are already installed, HSB-Gävleborg (responsible for Bogården) has a wish to investigate possible proposed actions for optimization of existing plant. After completed investigation, a new proposed action is presented. The new proposed action goes on intercepting the hot water production and using the heat pumps to only heat production during the heating season. Why the hot water production should be intercepted, is just in order to eliminate the risk of Legionella. Besides, the new proposal is going to bring about a reserve of 1, 534, 000 SEK during a twenty-year period. This is approximately twice as much as what the existing plant may bring during the same period. During the work's review, it also has been established that heat - and hot water systems are error regulated.
