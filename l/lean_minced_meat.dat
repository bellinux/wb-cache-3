40|$|The {{literature}} review covers {{different aspects of}} lipid oxidation and protein oxidation in meat. The mechanism of lipid and protein oxidation, factors influencing lipid oxidation, the consequences of protein oxidation, measurement methods, and the interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color are introduced. The present thesis was aiming to {{study the effects of}} different fatty acid composition on lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color in minced pork stored in modified atmosphere packages (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) at 5 oC during 12 days of storage. The possible interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color were also investigated. Minced meat differing in fatty acid composition was prepared by mixing <b>lean</b> <b>minced</b> <b>meat</b> and fat fractions obtained by dry fractionation. Three groups of minced meat were obtained, namely, more saturated, medium saturated and less saturated. Lipid and protein oxidation were measured by determining thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and free thiol content, respectively. Meat color measurement was performed using the Hunter L*, a*, b* system. The results showed that the less saturated group had higher oxidative stability in relation to lipid and protein oxidation than the more saturated and medium saturated groups, which might result from the balance between the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and the vitamin E content. This was supported by the finding that the less saturated samples contained more unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E than those in the more saturated and medium saturated groups. TBARS level was negatively related to free thiol content, indicating the presence of possible interactions between lipid and protein oxidation. Furthermore, a* values were found to be correlated to lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting likely interactions between these factors. However, color values were not influenced by fatty acid composition...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{exposure}} of the most incident foodborne pathogens in the Belgian meat production chain. The prevalence of Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria monocytogenes were evaluated in carcasses (swabs), retail cuts, <b>minced</b> <b>meat</b> and meat products of pork. The investigation was made each year since 1997, using official methods from the Ministry of Public Health for Salmonella and Campylobacter and the Vidas Listeria monocytogenes method. More than 10 % of each matrix were contaminated with Salmonella. For <b>minced</b> <b>meat</b> and meat products, the contamination rate were respectively round 20 % and 3 – 6 % for Listeria monocytogenes. Under 5 % of <b>minced</b> <b>meat</b> samples were positive for Campylobacter. For <b>minced</b> <b>meat,</b> the contamination has also been assessed according to the location of sampling (agreed, low capacity establishments or retail level).

Sensory evaluation of general appearance, color, smell, consistency of flesh of all meat samples were done by a panel of five members and found the beef samples in acceptable condition. Proximate composition of MI, M 2, M 3, M 4 and M 5 decreased gradually with the increase of storage period. The initial protein, lipid, ash and moisture content of all samples were ranged 22. 06 to 23. 41 %, 3. 84 to 4. 20 %, 1. 02 % to 1. 16 % and 70. 28 to 72. 00 %, respectively. The initial pH value was 5. 6, which decreased up to 20 days and then increased up {{to the end of the}} storage period. The initial expressible moisture, total Volatile Base Nitrogen (TVB-N) and peroxide value was lower and this value gradually increased with the advancement of storage period. The solubility of fresh meat was ranged from 81 to 94. 5 % initially and declined with the advancement of storage period. More rapid decline of solubility was observed in <b>Minced</b> <b>meat</b> (M 2) and lowest decreasing was observed in <b>Minced</b> <b>meat</b> with 4 % sucrose + 4 % sorbitol + 0. 3 % polyphosphate (M 5).
