25|$|The Operation Millpond B-26s {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to strike at Kong <b>Le,</b> <b>but</b> the strike was stayed by an event {{on the far side of}} the world. The Bay of Pigs Invasion failed, and that failure gave pause to U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the Programs Evaluation Office shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a Military Advisory Assistance Group. Emblematic of the change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.|$|E
25|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Dụ Tông, Nhật Lễ neglected his administrative duties and concentrated only on drinking, theatre, and wandering. He even {{wanted to change}} his family name back to Dương. Such activities disappointed everyone in the royal court. This prompted the Prime Minister Trần Nguyên Trác and his son Trần Nguyên Tiết to plot the assassination of Nhật <b>Lễ,</b> <b>but</b> their conspiracy was discovered by the Emperor and they were killed afterwards. In the tenth lunar month of 1370, the Emperor's father-in-law, Trần Phủ, after receiving advice from several mandarins {{and members of the}} royal family, decided to raise an army for the purpose of overthrowing Nhật Lễ. After one month, his plan succeeded and Trần Phủ became the new emperor of Đại Việt, ruling as Trần Nghệ Tông, while Nhật Lễ was downgraded to Duke of Hôn Đức (Hôn Đức Công) and was killed afterwards by an order of Nghệ Tông.|$|E

2500|$|After the coronation, Nghệ Tông {{tried to}} restore the order of royal court which was heavily damaged {{during the reign of}} Dụ Tông and Nhật <b>Lễ</b> <b>but</b> the {{progress}} came very slowly, partially because he did not have enough competent mandarins like Chu Văn An who died in 1370 or Trần Nguyên Đán who kept away from the court. Nghệ Tông faced his first failure in March 1371 when king of Champa Chế Bồng Nga commanded troop attacked directly Thăng Long, the capital of Đại Việt, after the petition of Nhật Lễ's mother. [...] Unable to confront with the strong and well-organized opponent, the royal court of the Trần Dynasty had to flee from Thăng Long and let the capital be violently looted by Chế Bồng Nga's army. Two months after the Champa's assault, Nghệ Tông appointed Hồ Quý Ly for one of the highest position in royal court, this was the evidence for the Emperor's confidence in Hồ Quý Ly who had two aunts entitled as consorts of Minh Tông and married the Princess of Huy Ninh, Nghệ Tông's younger sister. The Emperor also chose Đỗ Tử Bình, another notorious official in future, for the position of military counsellor in April 1372.|$|E
