40|$|Diversity (CBD) is {{dedicated}} to promoting sustainable development. Conceived as a practical tool for translating the principles of Agenda 21 into reality, the CBD recognizes that biological diversity {{is about more than}} plants, animals and microorganisms and their ecosystems – it is about people and our need for food security, medicines, fresh air and water, shelter, and a clean and healthy environment in which to live. The CBD {{is one of the most}} broadly subscribed international environmental treaties in the world. It currently has 193 Parties who have committed to its three main goals: the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of its components and the equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Secretariat is located in Montreal, Canada. Refer to www. cbd. int.
