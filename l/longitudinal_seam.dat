40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} in which identification of the controlling crack path was critical to identifying the root cause of the failure. The case involves the rupture of a 30 -inch (0. 76 m) natural gas pipeline in 2010 that tragically led to the destruction of a number of homes and the loss of life. The segment of the pipeline that ruptured was installed in 1956. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seam</b> of the segment that ruptured {{was supposed to have been}} fabricated by double submerged arc welding. Unfortunately, portions of the segment only received a single submerged arc weld on the outside, leaving unwelded areas on the inside diameter. Post-failure examination of the segment revealed that the rupture originated at one of these unwelded areas. Examination also revealed three additional crack paths or zones emanating from the unwelded area: a zone of ductile tearing, a zone of fatigue, and a zone of cleavage fracture, in that sequence. Initial investigators ignored the ductile tear, assumed the critical crack path was the fatigue component, and (incorrectly) concluded that the root cause of the incident was the failure of the operator to hydrotest the segment after it was installed in 1956. However, as discussed in this paper, the critical path or mechanism was the ductile tear. Furthermore, it was determined that the ductile tear was created during the hydrotest at installation by a mechanism known as pressure reversal. Thus the correct root cause of the rupture was the hydrotest the operator subjected the segment to at installation, helping to increase the awareness of operators and regulators about the potential problems associated with hydrotesting...|$|E

Endoprostheses (n= 31) underwent optical and scanning electron microscopy, filament dynamometry, and saturation index measurement. Results. The macroscopic lesions {{observed in the}} Stentor and Vanguard devices were holes at the extremities of the stents and slipping of the warp yarns {{at the level of}} sutures or of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seams.</b> The macroscopic lesions observed in AneurX endoprostheses were holes, slipping of the warp yarns and ruptures of the ligatures. The macroscopic lesions observed in the two Talent endoprostheses were sections of fibers {{at the level of the}} suture holes and few areas lesions of wear, with sometimes holes at the contact of the stent extremities. Stentor, Vanguard and AneurX all demonstrated low saturation indexes of the fabric (44 – 59 %) with an important anisotropy.

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> weld <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of <b>longitudinal</b> weld <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these weld seams. In our research, {{the concept of a}} weld seam integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the weld seam integrity indicator and thus to improved weld seam properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central <b>longitudinal</b> weld <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation of these weld seams through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the weld seam indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to weld seam formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that weld seam formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior weld seams, associated with low values of the weld seam integrity indicator. Through further elaboration of the concepts presented in this work, the weld seam integrity indicator is to be developed, with the future aim of predicting the weld seam performance through finite element simulations. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> weld <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. As these joins occur {{along the entire}} extruded length, it is desirable that these weld seams have a minimal impact on the structural integrity of the extrudate. In particular, defects associated with weld seam formation should be avoided. In this research, the occurrence of defects related to material flow inside the extrusion tooling is studied. In lab-scale experiments, EN AW- 6060 and EN AW- 6082 aluminium alloy billets are formed into strips {{by means of the}} direct hot extrusion process. By utilising model dies with an internal obstruction similar to the supports present in porthole dies, a strip with a central <b>longitudinal</b> weld <b>seam</b> is formed. The effects of different geometries of the weld-chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation is performed through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation, and microstructural analysis provides insight into the defects related to unsound metal flow. Through computer simulations, conditions related to weld seam formation are modelled and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results demonstrate that metal flow controlled by the die geometry causes defects leading to inferior mechanical performance of the extrudate. It is further argued that current weld seam formation criteria utilised in finite element modelling need enhancement to incorporate these flow related defects. cop. 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Research is {{currently}} being conducted on the feasibility of hydroforming extruded magnesium tubes to integrate multiple parts into a single hydroformed section. Among other advantages, such sections would reduce the weight of both cars and planes, particularly when used in the vehicle frame. This would lead to either reduced fuel costs, {{or the ability to}} carry an increased payload. Magnesium generally has limited ductility, which {{in the case of the}} current extruded tubes is even further reduced at the extrusion seams. These are locations where the material flow separates and rejoins during extrusion and are unavoidable when a hollow profile die is used. When the tubes are stressed in a circumferential direction by hydroforming, tube ruptures consistently occur along the extrusion seams of the tubes. This has led to the current project, an inquiry into the exact cause of failure at these locations. An overview of the nature of magnesium, including deformation systems is presented and the creation of irregularities at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seams</b> of the tube is discussed.

In the case of extruding a rectangular hollow profile through a porthole die with four ports, two neighbouring ports were different from each other.

The 3 D FE simulation also showed how two unequal metal streams contacted each other and became bonded in the welding chamber under a certain hydrostatic pressure and at a certain temperature, before the metal flew through the die bearing. The difference in velocity between the metal streams led to uneven flow at the die bearing and thus a wavy extrusion nose...|$|R
