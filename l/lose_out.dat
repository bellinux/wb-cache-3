5|$|Giovinco {{scored the}} only {{goal of the}} match in a Coppa Italia 1–0 win against Cagliari, {{allowing}} Juventus to progress to the quarter-finals of the competition. Juventus eventually managed to retain their Serie A title that season, with Giovinco managing 7 goals in the league, and 11 in total in all competitions, as Juventus reached the quarter-finals of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, and the semi-finals of the 2012–13 Coppa Italia, only to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> to {{the winners of the}} respective competitions, Bayern Munich and Lazio.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{was widely}} viewed as the {{favorite}} to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance {{and the possibility of}} running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause him to <b>lose.</b> <b>Out</b> of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and Our Native overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E
50|$|Wigan {{reached the}} Challenge Cup Semi-Final in 2009 <b>losing</b> <b>out</b> to Warrington by 26-39. The team also reached the Final Eliminator again.

5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with chilled meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2010, the 19-year-old Kieftenbeld {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Eredivisie club Groningen, who paid a €300,000 {{fee for the}} player. He was presented as a right back, despite only ever having played in midfield. In his first season at Groningen he did indeed play at right back, competently enough, but in a 5–1 defeat away to Feyenoord, he struggled against Ryo Miyaichi, a player with pace and ability with both feet, and eventually fouled him to concede a penalty. Groningen finished the season in fifth position, thus qualifying for the play-offs for {{a place in the}} Europa League. Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi-final, so was suspended for the second. He was replaced at half-time in the first leg of the final, which Groningen lost 5–1 to ADO Den Haag, and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four-goal deficit only to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> on penalties.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but {{there is no way that}} future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others <b>lose</b> <b>out,</b> there is no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others <b>lose</b> <b>out,</b> there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E
25|$|Heynckes was {{manager of}} Bayern Munich between 1 July 1987 and 8 October 1991. In his first season, Bayern won the DFB-Supercup. Bayern {{defeated}} Hamburger SV 2–1.

25|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is an international}} public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (Goldemberg et al., 1996:21,28,43). A change {{in the quality of}} the atmosphere does not affect the welfare of all individuals equally. In other words, some individuals may benefit from climate change, while others may <b>lose</b> <b>out.</b> This uneven distribution of potential climate change impacts, plus the uneven distribution of emissions globally, make it difficult to secure a global agreement to reduce emissions (Halsnæs et al., 2007:127).|$|E
25|$|In a notably {{successful}} {{season for}} Scottish clubs in Europe, Rangers {{had the chance}} to win Glasgow's second continental trophy within a week after reaching the Cup Winners Cup final for the second time, only to narrowly <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> to Bayern Munich in Nuremberg. Earlier in May there had been the possibility of Scottish involvement in the final of all three European tournaments, but Kilmarnock lost out to Leeds United in their Fairs Cup semi-final meeting. Nevertheless, it remains the club's best European run.|$|E

25|$|The Cornwall Railway was {{conceived}} because of fears that Falmouth would <b>lose</b> <b>out,</b> as a port, to Southampton. Falmouth had {{for many years}} had {{nearly all of the}} packet trade: dispatches from the Colonies and overseas territories arrived by ship and were conveyed to London by road coach. The primitive roads of those days made this a slow business and Southampton was developing in importance. The completion of the London and Southampton Railway in 1840 meant that dispatches could be taken on to London swiftly by train.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 2008, Grant's Chelsea beat Liverpool 3–2 (4–3 on aggregate) {{to advance}} to the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final, {{something}} they failed to achieve under former manager José Mourinho. Chelsea drew 1–1 with Manchester United in the final, only to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> on the European Cup in a penalty shootout which United won 6–5. In the heavy rain, John Terry slipped on his team's fifth penalty, clipping the ball off the post and wide. Had he scored, Chelsea would have won the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Despite Cottee {{scoring a}} hat-trick on his debut against Newcastle United {{and going on}} {{to be one of}} the most highly rated frontmen to wear an Everton shirt, Everton's league {{fortunes}} declined in 1988–89 as they finished eighth in the league. Everton did return to Wembley twice, in April for the Full Members Cup final only to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> to Nottingham Forest and in May in the FA Cup final, losing 3–2 to Liverpool in extra-time, in a game somewhat overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster in Liverpool's semi-final.|$|E

25|$|Glentoran's finest hour {{came in a}} European Cup {{encounter}} with Benfica in 1967. The tie was played over two legs, the first being at the Oval. Glentoran scored a penalty early on and held out for nearly sixty minutes until football great Eusébio equalised. The match ended 1–1. The return tie was at Benfica's Estádio da Luz. Part-time Glentoran were expected to crumble {{under the pressure of}} the occasion, but again held out for a famous 0–0 draw. Benfica advanced to the next round on the away goals rule. Glentoran were the first team to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> to this rule and the first team to stop Benfica scoring at home.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
25|$|O'Reilly's media career took a major blow after various New York Times {{investigations}} {{revealed that}} he had paid half a dozen women nearly $50 million to settle various sexual harassment lawsuits. After the first New York Times investigation revealed that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five sexual harassment lawsuits totaling $13 million, Fox News terminated O'Reilly's employment in April 2017. In October 2017, the New York Times reported an additional settlement of $32 million that O'Reilly had paid to settle a sixth sexual harassment lawsuit, which had been filed against him by former Fox News analyst Lis Wiehl. The revelation of this sixth settlement caused O'Reilly to <b>lose</b> <b>out</b> on contracts with various sponsors, syndicators, and advertisers for a potential new radio or television show.|$|E
