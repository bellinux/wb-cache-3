Nonlinear interactions between different scale length are modeled as turbulent drag, nonlinear noise and nonlinear drive {{and a set}} of Langevin equations is formulated. Using this model, a case where two driving mechanisms coexist (one for the micro mode and the other for semi-micro mode) is investigated. It is found that a new type of turbulence transition and a cusp-type catastrophe exist in some parameter regime. Numerical simulations are also performed for neighboring multiple-scale turbulence such as ion temperature gradient driven drift wave(ITG) (kappa_y rho_i 1) modes in the shearless slab geometry. The cascade and inverse cascade in multiple-scale turbulence are investigated. The cascade is mainly observed ina(kappa parallel) ? space. On the other hand, the cascade and the inverse cascade are observed in (kappa perp) ?space.

The upgraded ATF CO_{ 2 } laser will have a pulse length as short as 2  ps. At a nominal plasma density of ∼ 10 ^{ 16 }[*][*]cm^{- 3 }, this pulse length would normally be considered too long for resonant LWFA, but too short for self-modulated LWFA.

Here, fluctuations of interfacial boundaries in an organic thin film, acridine- 9 -carboxylic acid (ACA) on Ag(111), have been visualized in real time, and measured quantitatively, using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. The boundaries fluctuate via molecular exchange with exchange time constants of 10 - 30 ms at room temperature, yielding <b>length</b> <b>mode</b> fluctuations that should yield characteristic f- 1 / 2 signatures for frequencies less than ~ 100 Hz. Although ACA has highly anisotropic intermolecular interactions, it forms islands that are compact in shape with crystallographically distinct boundaries that have essentially identical thermodynamic and kinetic properties. The physical basis of the modified symmetry is shown to arise from significantly different substrate interactions induced by alternating orientations of successive molecules in the condensed phase. Incorporating this additional set of interactions in a lattice gas model leads to effective multi-component behavior, as in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model, and can straightforwardly reproduce the experimentally observed isotropic behavior. The general multi-component description allows the domain shapes and boundary fluctuations to be tuned from isotropic to highly anisotropic {{in terms of the}} balance between intermolecular interactions and molecule-substrate interactions.

In 1991 bluemouth appeared in the northern North Sea as a distinct cohort, with total lengths ranging between 6 and 8 cm. 1991 was a year of exceptional Atlantic inflow into the North Sea, and {{it is likely that the}} bluemouth used this water mass as a highway, entering from the north and west as small individuals.

40|$|Pipe {{systems that}} are used in the process {{industry}} may occasionally be subjected to internal deflagration and detonation waves. In those cases the design of the pipe system should be explosion resistant or even explosion proof. The usual design rule for the analysis of the mechanical response is based on the hoop stress calculated with an equivalent static pressure load, which depends on the magnitude of the detonation pressure. However, it has been found that the response of a pipe to a traveling detonation wave shows a number of effects that lead to much higher stresses. See [1] and [2]. One of these effects is mode coupling, i. e., the excitation of circumferential bending modes, coupled to the initial hoop stress or breathing mode, which may lead to an increase of the local maximum stress by a factor 2. 6. Mode coupling has been investigated theoretically for rings and it has been demonstrated also experimentally, among others by Li c. s. [5]. Using finite element modeling we have investigated under what conditions mode coupling can occur in pipes in which a detonation wave propagates. It appears that a condition for mode coupling in a 3 D configuration is that the detonation velocity is larger than the first critical velocity Vc 0. For a pipe section of limited <b>length</b> <b>mode</b> coupling will be enhanced by the flanges at both boundaries which reflect flexural waves that propagate in axial direction. Furthermore, the effect of limited plasticity has been investigated. The results show that mode coupling is being reduced by plasticity. The conclusion is that with plasticity the detonation load can be larger without bursting of the pipe. However, mode coupling will still occur in spite of plastic deformation. In the paper the modeling of 2 D mode coupling is presented and compared with the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the extension of the model to a pipe with a finite length and an "infinite pipe" is discussed and the effect of plasticity is analyzed. The analysis incorporates the influence of the material strain rate sensitivity and it considers the response for regular structural pipe steel as well as high strength steel.
