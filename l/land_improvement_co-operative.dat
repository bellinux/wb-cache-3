40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvements</b> {{with long}} pay-back periods are often delayed on leased {{agricultural}} land, resulting in social costs through land degradation, decreased land productivity and environmental problems. An {{important question is}} thus how landowners would respond to regulations and mandates concerning <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Based on a landowner survey, we analyse landowner choices under certain <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> regulations, using the currently dominant choice of leasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing {{will continue to increase}} in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices. Current leasers and amenity owners, in particular, were sensitive to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> mandates, and would avoid compulsory investment expenses by selling or afforesting their land. contingent behaviour, latent class model, landlord, land use, heterogeneity, Land Economics/Use, Q 15, Q 24, Q 28,...|$|R

As the Main construction projects were completed, the purpose of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts Has shifted from facilities construction to operation and maintenance of them. However, the recent social situation has brought great changes in circumstance to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts. In both urban and agricultural areas around local cities, urbanization has progressed so rapidly and widely that agricultural land has decreased through conversion into urban use. That causes pollution of irrigated water and difficulties in maintenance of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities. In rural moutainous areas, on the other hand, excess Depletion in population has occurred, causing difficulties in proper maintenance of Agricultural <b>land</b> and <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities, which eventually increases the danger of natural disaster. Also, in other agricultural areas, the decline in agriculture of this country has degraded the quality of the production and living environments. This work was conducted to analyze the present situations of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> Districts in differing geographical and social conditions, and to discuss the problems Surrounding them. Through such discussion, we pointout some possible remedies which Might improve the situation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvement</b> and <b>land</b> {{development}} are general terms {{that in some}} contexts may include infrastructure, but {{in the context of}} a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> not infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{long-term}} <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> (lime application) under {{land tenure}} insecurity on leased land. The dynamic optimisation problem is solved by a stochastic dynamic programming routine with known parameters for one-period returns and transition equations. The model parameters represent Finnish soil quality and production conditions. The farmer's decision rules are solved for alternative likelihood scenarios over {{the continuation of}} the fixed term lease contract. The results suggest that, as the probability for non-renewal of the lease contract increases, farmers quickly decrease investments in irreversible <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> and, thereafter, yields decline gradually. The estimated decision rules are a part of larger set of farmer's decision rules to be taken care when land leasing and environmental legislation is renewed.

According to EU policies and directives, Romania oriented his own policy toward farms and various forms of their association, as the main beneficiaries of state aid for agriculture and hence for irrigation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterize the Romanian national strategies for <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> in the context of conditioning aid application to the recovery of the costs of water services including those relating to the environment. There are also presented the reality of the Romanian agricultural <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> sector in general and of the Covurlui Plateau agricultural <b>land</b> <b>improvement,</b> in particular. Considering the real issues of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> sector in Romania we conclude that it can not take full account of the principle of cost recovery from the direction of Irrigation beneficiaries (farmers and their associations), so long as the alternative would be the destruction of Irrigation and fall of agricultural activity in Romania...|$|R

Most are depreciable, but some <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined.
