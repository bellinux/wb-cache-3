50|$|Calcium {{permanganate}} is an {{oxidizing agent}} and chemical compound with the chemical formula Ca(MnO4)2. It {{consists of the}} metal calcium and two permanganate ions. It is noncombustible, but, being a strong oxidizing agent, it will accelerate the burning of <b>combustible</b> <b>material.</b> If the <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> is finely divided, the resulting mixture may be explosive. Contact with <b>liquid</b> <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> may result in spontaneous ignition. Contact with sulfuric acid may cause fires or explosions. Mixtures with acetic acid or acetic anhydride can explode if not kept cold. Explosions can occur when mixtures of calcium permanganate and sulfuric acid {{come into contact with}} benzene, carbon disulfide, diethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, petroleum, or other organic matter.|$|R

40|$|The United States Department of Energy is {{presently}} {{faced with the}} stabilization and safe disposition of hundreds of metric tons of residue materials resulting from 50 + years of nuclear weapons production activities. These residues encompass {{a broad range of}} substrates and radionuclides and include both solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Combustible</b> residues constitute a significant fraction of the total residue inventory, and an important constituent within the combustible category is spent anion ion-exchange resins. These resins are typically utilized for the separation of plutonium from other radionuclides under strongly acidic nitric or hydrochloric acid solution conditions which favor the formation and partitioning of anionic Pu(IV) nitrato or chloride species. The spent resins are usually rinsed prior to storage as residues to reduce both acid and radionuclide concentrations, but significant radionuclide concentrations remain in these resins, and the long-term effects of concentrated acid and radiolysis on the resin integrity are relatively unexplored. Thus, new research is needed to assess the stability of these resin residues and address the need for further treatment to ensure stability prior to long-term disposal...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to quantitatively study the combustion characteristics and dynamic smoke properties by using cone calorimeter at different external heat flux. The relationship between heat release rate (HRR) and smoke production rate (SPR) of four decorative materials is investigated. The {{results show that the}} external heat flux levels and material compositions significant influence the HRR and SPR, indicating noncombustible materials of flame retarded chipboard (FRCB) and gypsum board (GPB) own the lower HRR and SPR compared to <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> of medium density fiberboard (MDFB) and melamine faced chipboard (MFCB). It is suggested that the peak SPR is linearly related to peak HRR for four decorative materials which the correlation coefficients are all above 0. 94. When the decorative material is noncombustible, a negative linear relationship exists between peak SPR and peak HRR for GPB and FRCB. However, a positive linear relationship appears to <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> for FRCB and MDFB. This correlation demonstrates two different tendencies between SPR and HRR for noncombustible and <b>combustible</b> <b>materials,</b> contributing to understand the fire risk of decorative materials...|$|R
