5|$|The {{first four}} Grizzlies seasons had given average {{attendance}} {{in the middle}} third of the league. However, {{the last two seasons}} saw a reduction to among the league's lowest attendances; participating reasons were the team's poor performance and the 1998–99 NBA lockout. Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak Canadian dollar, unwillingness of some U.S. players to live in Canada, and lack of <b>local</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{months of}} speculation, on May 23, 1994, Top Rank {{successfully}} purchased the franchise for $152.5 million {{with the intention}} of relocating it to New Orleans. The purchase occurred following an agreement between Top Rank and Timberwolves ownership that allowed Top Rank to purchase the franchise if no <b>local</b> <b>ownership</b> groups were found by May 20, 1994. On June 6, 1994, Top Rank officially filed the paperwork to the NBA seeking to relocate the Timberwolves to New Orleans for the 1994–95 NBA season. The filings also identified Fred Hofheinz as the sole Top Rank stockholder, with Houston lawyer John O'Quinn and stockbroker Robert Higley serving as the team's major partners.|$|E

A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their opposition to a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue began to take shape as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Local</b> {{government}} <b>ownership</b> had dominated China’s township {{and village}} enterprises (TVEs) and made {{significant contribution to}} the TVE growth miracle for many years. However, since the mid- 1990 s, TVEs have conducted a series of radical and successful restructuring in their ownership and governance arrangements. The most striking feature of the restructuring is the fading out of <b>local</b> government <b>ownership.</b> This paper discusses why <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> could dominate private ownership in the first two decades of China’s transition and identifies what factors have driven the fading out of <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> over TVEs in recent years. It then characterizes an emerging new ownership form called “joint-stock cooperative ” (gufen hezuozhi) and shows the adaptive efficiency feature of the new form. By this way, the paper also sheds light on the roles that an alternative form of ownership and governance can play in an alternative institutional environment...|$|R

30|$|For <b>local</b> {{government}} <b>ownership,</b> {{the coefficient}} is positive but statistically {{significant at the}} 5 % level, indicating that firms affiliated with local government {{is more likely to}} invest in risky R&D project without supporting Hypothesis 2 b. But the associated coefficient is much smaller than that for central government ownership, implying that firms affiliated with local government are less likely to invest in risky R&D project than those affiliated with central government. In contrast, for innovation performance, the coefficient on the <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> is negative and statistically significant at the 5 % level after controlling for R&D intensity, which predicts that firms affiliated with local government are less capable to generate new products. This result supports Hypothesis 3 b. Thus, <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> tends to decrease the effectiveness of firms in generating innovation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Using {{the data}} from Japanese LMEs in the tourism industry, this paper aims to {{evaluate}} the impact of governance structure on their performance. Our main findings are as follows: the percentage of <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> has {{a negative impact on}} performance. A 1 % decrease in <b>local</b> government <b>ownership</b> results in currents profits improving 0. 129 % at the sample mean. As for the board composition of LMEs, it is not clear if the degree of local government participation affects performance. [JEL Classification]: H 7, L 32...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{strength}} of the bank-firm relationship affects the level of cash holding, especially in the tighter period of monetary policy. We measure the {{strength of}} bank-firm relationship by holding bank ownership, bank-firm proximity (holding <b>local</b> bank <b>ownership)</b> {{and the number of}} holding <b>local</b> bank <b>ownership.</b> We argue that remote location between firm and bank increases the cost of financial external fund, if the headquarters of firms and holding ownership bank are the same province, it is easier for companies to obtain external funding. So the {{strength of the}} local bank-firm relationship can ease financial constraint. As expected, stronger evidence supports that firms with stronger bank-firm relationship tend to hold less cash. The firms without stronger bank-firm relationship adjust their level of cash holding more quickly toward target level than holding <b>local</b> bank <b>ownership</b> firms and stronger bank relationship reduces the investment-cash sensitivity. Our findings are in line with our expectations and support both the precautionary motive for holding cash and the pecking order theory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the speed of price adjustment and stock ownership by foreign and local institutional investors using data from the Korean stock market.

Likewise, returns of stocks with high <b>local</b> institutional <b>ownership</b> lead returns of stocks with low <b>local</b> institutional <b>ownership.</b> These results support the idea that foreign institutional (local institutional) investors have faster access to or processing power of new information than local institutional (local individual) investors.

25|$|The {{bankruptcy}} declaration was {{the beginning}} of a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. The group of creditors, which include banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support form most of the paper's unions and launched a public-relations campaign to promote <b>local</b> <b>ownership.</b> A bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but the lenders had the winning bid. On May 21, Brian Tierney stepped down as CEO of Philadelphia Media Holdings and was replaced by Joseph Bondi, the company's restructuring adviser.|$|E

The group established the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company with $600,000 in capital and eventually turned it {{into one of the}} nation's most important steel producers. Wick, who emerged as the steel company's first president in 1900, appointed Campbell as secretary. Two years later, Campbell rose to the position of vice president; and in 1904, he began his long tenure as president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube. Wick, meanwhile, was forced to take an extended leave of absence because of health problems, though he returned to the company a few years before his death.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} <b>local</b> <b>ownership</b> {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the editorial independence of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, who in the past had criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group—owner of MyNetworkTV {{affiliate}} WTVZ-TV (channel 33)—entered into {{an agreement}} to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune, pending regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. While WTKR is not in conflict with existing FCC in-market ownership rules and would be acquired by Sinclair in any event, the group is precluded from acquiring WGNT directly as broadcasters are not currently allowed to legally own more than two full-power television stations in a single market (both WGNT and WTVZ-TV rank below the ratings threshold that forbids common ownership {{of two of the}} four highest-rated stations by total day viewership in a single market). As such, the companies may be required to sell either WGNT or WTVZ to another broadcasting group in order to comply with FCC ownership rules and alleviate potential antitrust issues preceding approval of the acquisition; however, a sale of either of the two lower-rated stations to an independent buyer is dependent on later decisions by the FCC regarding <b>local</b> <b>ownership</b> of broadcast television stations and future acts by Congress. Alternatively, Sinclair may opt to either take over the operations of WTKR/WGNT or transfer ownership of and retain operational responsibilities for WTVZ-TV through a local marketing agreement with one of its partner companies.|$|E
