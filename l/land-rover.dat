50|$|The Brigade {{during this}} period {{conducted}} extensive tests on developing a heavy drop capability. The tests originated at 1 Parachute Battalion in 1982 with stripped-down <b>Land-Rovers</b> dubbed ‘Fireflies’, progressing to successfully dropping light armored reconnaissance vehicles carrying potent anti-tank weapons systems.|$|R
50|$|Morattab Industrial Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} in 1957- it was named: Sherkat Sahami Am Sanaati Towlidi Morratab (the Morratab Industrial Com.) - {{initially}} as an agent and distributor of commercial vehicles and trucks, before branching into the manufacture of <b>Land-Rovers</b> under licence from Rover of England in 1962. The Company was nationalised without compensation to its founders and rightful owners during the Iranian Revolution.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the British Army had {{acquired}} around 9,000 Series III models, which were mainly a special 'Heavy Duty' {{version of the}} [...] Soft Top. These models had improved suspension components and a different chassis cross-member design. These were produced in 12-volt 'GS' models and 24-volt 'FFR' versions. A small number were [...] GS and FFR models, but in general the Army used the Air-Portable 1/2 ton, [...] "Lightweight" [...] version. The Lightweight was in service by many armies all over the world. In Europe even the Dutch Landmacht and the Danish Army used the <b>Land-Rover</b> Lightweight. Instead of the petrol engine the Dutch and Danish Lightweights had diesel engines. Instead of the canvas top the Dutch ones had PVC tops like the modern Land Rover 'Wolf'.|$|E
2500|$|The 1 Ton 109inch was {{produced}} from 1968 to 1977, covering late IIA and series III Models. It {{was basically a}} Series IIB Forward Control built with a standard 109in body, featuring 2.6-litre petrol engine, lower ratio gearbox, ENV front and rear axles, (Salisbury front and rear on later Series IIIs) though some late IIAs were fitted with ENV axles in front and Salisbury on the rear. Later series IIIs had a Rover type front axle with uprated differential. The chassis frame was unique to the model and featured drop-shackle suspension similar to the military series Land Rovers. 900x16 tyres were a standard feature and these machines were commonly used by utility companies and breakdown/recovery firms. [...] Only 170 IIA and 238 Series IIIs (1 Ton) were built for the home market. Export markets had even fewer examples, making {{this one of the}} rarest types of <b>Land-Rover</b> ever built.|$|E
2500|$|The PSP militia fielded by 1977 a small {{mechanized}} corps made of Panhard AML-90 and Staghound armoured cars, M42 Duster SPAAGs and M113 {{armored personnel}} carriers seized from the Lebanese Army in February 1976, plus a fleet of gun-trucks or technicals. The latter consisted of US Willys M38A1 MD jeeps, <b>Land-Rover</b> series II-III, Toyota Land Cruiser (J40), Peugeot 404, GMC Sierra Custom K25/K30, and Jeep Gladiator J20 light pickup trucks and M35A1 2½-ton (6x6) military trucks, equipped with heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles, and Anti-aircraft autocannons. [...] These vehicles were partially supplanted in the early 1980s by new models, such as Jeep CJ-5 and CJ-8 (Civilian versions of the Willys M38A1 MD jeep), Toyota Land Cruiser (J45), Toyota Land Cruiser (J55), Toyota Land Cruiser (J70), Nissan Patrol 160-Series, and Datsun 720 pickup trucks, whilst {{the disintegration of the}} Fourth Brigade allowed the PLA to seize a number of US M151A2 jeeps, M880/M890 Series CUCV, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) technicals re-armed with recoilless rifles and AA autocannons. [...] They also captured two Alvis Saladin armoured cars, seven US-made M48A5 main battle tanks (MBTs), AMX-13 light tanks, and additional M113 APCs for their own armoured corps.|$|E
25|$|Guardians of the Cedars, {{exclusively}} Maronite {{with strong}} anti-Syrian views, 3,000–6,000 uniformed militiamen armed with modern small-arms. They were {{backed by a}} mechanized force consisting of a single M50 Super Sherman medium tank, a few M42 Dusters and Chaimite V200 armoured cars backed by gun-trucks (<b>Land-Rovers,</b> Toyota Land Cruisers, GMC and Ford light pick-ups, plus US M35A2 2-1/2 ton cargo trucks) fitted with heavy machine guns (HMGs), recoilless rifles, and a few anti-aircraft autocannons.|$|R
5000|$|Each SPG section had 30 members, and was {{assigned}} a number and a colour - No.2 Section, based at Tennent Street, off the Shankill Road, Belfast, for example, was designated 'Blue section'. These were the first policemen trained by the British Army {{in the use of}} riot equipment and tactics which it had developed since starting Operation Banner in Northern Ireland in 1969. They were given upgraded weaponry and dispersed in units across the region. The uniformed sections carried out 24 hour anti-terrorist patrols in fibreglass-reinforced 'Makrolon' <b>Land-Rovers,</b> as opposed to the armour-plated <b>Land-Rovers</b> used by some other units. The 'Makrolons' patrolled with open back doors, so that SPG officers could debus rapidly under fire.In addition to Walther PP pistols (later replaced with [...]357 magnum Ruger Speed Six revolvers, which were reckoned to have more 'stopping power' than the standard Walther) and batons, each constable carried either a Stirling sub-machine gun, an Ruger 14 Carbine, or a 7.62 mm SLR rifle. A few officers were issued with Lee-Enfield sniper-rifles with telescopic sights, converted to use 7.62 mm ammunition.. The six-man teams were trained in special weapons and tactics (SWAT) techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of materials, the Ministry of Supply, whose wartime controls over the allocation of steel would remain in force from 1945 to 1954, had allocated Lagonda the steel for only 100 cars. Although the Ministry’s controls were intended to maintain supply to existing manufacturers, they were applied unevenly—while Lagonda had tooled up for quantity production and provided evidence of a substantial export order book, David Brown's companies were able to obtain the steel they required. One consequence of the controls was that aluminium {{was used in the}} construction of <b>Land-Rovers,</b> winning them an unintended reputation for not rusting.|$|R
2500|$|The LRP militia {{began to}} be quietly raised in 1974 by Sakr in his {{capacity}} as president of the Party, though it was only in September 1975 when they made their existence public in an official communiqué as the Guardians of the Cedars. [...] Headquartered at the main LRP party' Offices in Ashrafieh and personally commanded by Sakr, the GoC initially numbered some 500 men and women trained by Kayrouz Baraket, a young Lebanese Army officer, and equipped with obsolete firearms purchased on the black market. Although the membership of the GoC was exclusively Maronite, Sakr allegedly maintained a loyal personal bodyguard made up of Lebanese Shia Muslims, but little is known about them. [...] The collapse of the Lebanese Army in January 1976 allowed Sakr to recruit army deserters and seize some heavy equipment from its barracks and Internal Security Forces (ISF) Police stations, swelling the GoC ranks to 3,000-6,000 uniformed militiamen armed with modern small-arms. They fielded a mechanized force consisting of a single M50 Super Sherman medium tank, a few M42 Dusters and Chaimite V200 armoured cars backed by gun-trucks or technicals. The latter consisted of <b>Land-Rover</b> series II-III, Toyota Land Cruiser (J40), Dodge Power Wagon W200, Jeep J20 pickup trucks, GMC Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne and Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale light pickups, plus US GMC C7500 heavy-duty trucks and M35A1 2½-ton 6x6 cargo trucks fitted with heavy machine guns (HMGs), recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft autocannons.|$|E

50|$|The 101FC {{also served}} with the RAF Regiment. Two 101s were {{allocated}} to each Rapier Missile set up. The British RAF Rapier system used three <b>Land-Rovers</b> in deployment: a 24V winch fitted 101 Firing Unit Tractor (FUT) to tow the launch trailer, loaded with four Rapier missiles, guidance equipment and radio; a 12V winch fitted 101 Tracking Radar Tractor (TRT) to tow the Blindfire Radar trailer, also loaded with four Rapier missiles and guidance equipment; and a 109 Land Rover to tow a reload trailer with 9 Rapier missiles and loaded with the unit's other supplies and kit.|$|R
2500|$|The New Zealand Army {{purchased}} 640 of the Australian-made series 1 between 1951-1953. A similar {{number of}} series 2 were purchased in 1959-1962 {{and a small}} batch of series 2A in 1965-1967. New Zealand purchased {{a small number of}} ex-Australian series 2 and 2A vehicles in 1971-72, out of the pool used by the ANZUK force in Singapore, which were typically re-manufactured by BLMC NZ Ltd in Wellington and hence carry New Zealand build plates. These are commonly called a Land Rover [...] "Skippy" [...] and are distinctive with differently cut guards. 566 of the series 3, mostly 109" [...] V8.s, were purchased in 1982-83. <b>land-rovers</b> were phased out of new Zealand service in 2007/2008 when they were replaced by 321 Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The Series IIA FC {{launched}} in 1962 {{was based on}} the Series IIA 2.25-litre petrol engine and [...] chassis, with the cab positioned over the engine to give more load space. Export vehicles were the first <b>Land-Rovers</b> to get the 2.6-litre petrol engine. Most examples had an ENV (heavy duty) rear axle, a matching front axle came later. Tyres were large 900×16 types on deep-dish wheel rims to spread the ground weight of this heavy vehicle. These vehicles were somewhat underpowered for the increased load capacity (...) , and most had a hard working life. Less than 2,500 were made, and most had a utility body, but surviving examples often have custom bodywork. With an upgraded powertrain, they {{can be used as a}} small motorhome.|$|R

50|$|On 7 July 1962, the {{students}} had discussed foraround an hour about the ‘unjust’ hostel rules in the Assembly Hall of the RUSUbuilding, when some 2,000 students embarked on a peaceful protest march onRangoon University campus to announce that they would continue to oppose thehostel regulations of the military regime Around anotherhour later, at 3 p.m., the protest dispersed and {{the students}} returned totheir hostels and homes. However, leading members of the RUSU, includingpresident Ba Swe, continued to further discuss the matter of hostelregulations and to define a strategy for the protests.In the following minutes, a special dynamicevolved, which would, for the first time, reveal the military regime’s new toughstance against anti-regime actors challenging the government’s claim forabsolute domination. According to eyewitness reports, the police arrived with eightarmy jeeps and <b>land-rovers,</b> stormed the RUSU building and arrested members ofthe RUSU, including the president. Students whofled the scene {{are said to have}} spread the news about the events. As aconsequence, hundreds of students came out of their hostels and started tofight against the police. The military regime send in even morepolice cars and started to spray tear gas amongst the students. The students,on the other hand, threw stones and lit fireworks whilst shouting offensiveslogans targeted against General Ne Win. The events followed ageneral pattern persistent since the first student protests emerged in colonialBurma. As during past incidents of student demonstrations, the protests firstcentred around genuine student issues—thenew stricter hostel regulations. The student leaders, then, utilized theexisting momentum and transformed the dynamic into a general political protestagainst the Ne Win government. Furthermore, some authorsalso report that police cars were set on fire and some policeman injured. However, in the absence of reliable sources it must remain unclearwhich side started the violent acts and, likewise, whether and how many studentswere already injured after this first clash.|$|R
