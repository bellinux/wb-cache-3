25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon auxin distribution is apical dominance, {{which means the}} auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E
500|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree, typically reaching [...] tall (exceptionally up to [...] ), with a slender trunk usually under [...] diameter. The bark {{on the trunk}} and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white {{as a result of}} papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related Paper birch (B. papyrifera). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often [...] The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial, that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a <b>lateral</b> <b>bud.</b> The species is monoecious with male and female catkins found in the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.|$|E
50|$|More simply stated, <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> {{formation}} is inhibited by the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> primordium (from which the <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> develops) is located below SAM. The shoot tip {{rising from the}} SAM inhibits {{the growth of the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> by repressing auxin. When the shoot is cut off, the <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> begins to lengthen which is mediated by a release of cytokinin. Once the apical dominance has been lifted from the plant, elongation and lateral growth is promoted and the lateral buds grow into new branches. When <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> formation prevents the plant from growing upward, it is undergoing lateral dominance. Often, lateral dominance can be triggered by decapitating the SAM or artificially decreasing the concentration of auxin in plant tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Lateral</b> <b>buds</b> on intact pea plants (Pisum sativum L. cv. Alaska) remain dormant {{until they}} are stimulated to develop by decapitating the ter-minal bud. Using {{two-dimensional}} gel electrophor-esis, we have examined the protein content of ter-minal and <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> from intact plants and from plants at various times after decapitation. Silver-staining and in-vivo-labeling demonstrated very different sets of proteins. The level of expression of 18 stained and 25 labeled proteins was altered when growth was stimulated; this represents 3. 4 % and 9. 1 % of the total proteins detected by each method, respectively. Within 24 h of being stimu-lated, <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> doubled in length and their pro-tein content was qualitatively nearly {{the same as that}} of terminal buds. Six hours after decapitation, before the onset of detectable growth, the overall pattern of protein synthesis in <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> was more like that of growing <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> or of termi-nal buds than that of dormant <b>lateral</b> <b>buds.</b> Direct application of N 6 -furfurylaminopurine (kinetin) to buds on intact plants stimulated their growth and resulted in the same pattern of protein synthesis as did decapitation. Inhibition of bud growth by addition of indole- 3 -acetic a id to the stumps of decapitated plants resulted in the synthesis of dor-mancy-related proteins. <b>Lateral</b> <b>buds</b> at all stages of development incorporated labeled amino acids at similar rates, indicating that metabolic activity is not a component of dormancy in these buds...|$|R

50|$|The {{axillary}} bud (or <b>lateral</b> <b>bud)</b> is an embryonic shoot {{located in the}} axil of a leaf.

5000|$|These stages {{can also}} be defined by the hormones that are {{regulating}} the process which are as follows: Stage I, cytokinin promoted, causing the <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> to form since cytokinin {{plays a role in}} cell division; Stage II, auxin is promoted, resulting in apical dominance ("imposition of inhibition"); Stage III, cytokinin released resulting in outward growth of the lateral bud; and Stage IV, auxin is decreased and gibberellic acid is promoted which results in cell division, enabling the bud or branch to continue outward growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{dominance}} {{exerted by}} apical buds over {{the growth of}} laterals Is believed to be a phenomenon mediated by auxin. In Vicia faba one of the actions of auxin in causing bud inhibition, seems to be on the conducting strands of the stem {{at the base of the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>buds.</b> Sieve-tube development is hampered by auxin, transported from the apical buds. This leads to a restriction of supply of cotyledonary nutrients to the buds which then retards development. Auxin Inhibition action is largely on the cell division phase of bud growth. It Is primarily controlled by auxin and is not due to lack of substances like kinetin or gibberellic acid which normally participate in cell division phenomenon. Maleic hydrazide Is found to break 'apical dominance' by negating auxin action In plants, possibly by causing its oxidation. The polar transport and the effect of IAA In the main stem presumably at the base of the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> has been confirmed by blocking the auxin movement by TIBA. IAA transported normally In the stem inhibits the growth of the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds,</b> whether or not its entry into the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> is blocked by TIBA. However when IAA is prevented from reaching the stem at bud region, the inhibition of bud growth is invariably released. By applying IAA labelled with C 14 to the decapitated/decapitated plants, the presence of radioactivity In the inhibited buds can be detected. Extraction of radioactive substance from the plant parts and Its identification by paper chromatography suggested that the radioactive substance Is not IAA. Its growth promoting activities are low In bioassay with the Avena mesocotyl. These observations positively support the theory that the primary auxin action is in the stem at the base of the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> and that the effect on the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> is a secondary one. <p...|$|R

5000|$|Cytokinins are {{involved}} in many plant processes, including cell division and shoot and root morphogenesis. They are known to regulate axillary bud growth and apical dominance. The [...] "direct inhibition hypothesis" [...] posits that these effects result from the cytokinin to auxin ratio. This theory states that auxin from apical buds travels down shoots to inhibit axiliary bud growth. This promotes shoot growth, and restricts lateral branching. Cytokinin moves from the roots into the shoots, eventually signaling <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth. Simple experiments support this theory. When the apical bud is removed, the axillary buds are uninhibited, lateral growth increases, and plants become bushier. Applying auxin to the cut stem again inhibits lateral dominance.|$|E

50|$|Plants form new {{tissue in}} an area called the meristem, located near the tips of roots and shoots, where active cell {{division}} takes place. Meristem growth is aimed at ensuring that leaves are quickly elevated into sunlight, and that roots are able to penetrate deeply into the soil. Once adequate height and length is achieved by the stems and roots, they begin to thicken to support the plant. On the shoots, these growing tips of the plant are called apical buds. The apical meristem (or tip) produces the growth hormone auxin, which not only promotes cell division, but also diffuses downwards and inhibits the development of <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth that otherwise competes with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressive hormone lets lower, dormant lateral buds develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots that compete to become lead growth.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{the end of}} a shoot {{contains}} an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs. The apical bud produces an auxin (IAA) that inhibits growth of the <b>lateral</b> <b>buds</b> further down on the stem towards the axillary bud.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of GA to apical dominance in Coleus was examined by substituting 1 % IAA, in lanolin, for the shoot apex of CCC-treated, control and GA-treated plants containing, theoretically, hyponormal, normal and hypernormal GA levels, respectively. The greatest inhibition of <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth was {{obtained in the}} treatment combining 1 % IAA and 100 ppm GA, suggesting that GA may be important in the apical dominance of Coleus. CCC inhibited main axis growth, reduced the level of endogenous GA and caused a marked release of lateral buds from apical dominance. The significant stimulation of <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth by CCC could not be ascribed to reduced endogenous GA since it was not reversed by exogenous GA, or by GA plus IAA, whereas 100 ppm GA overcame the inhibition of main axis growth by CCC. It was also shown that the CCC stimulation was not a result of compensatory growth, that is, enhanced <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> growth resulting from reduced apical bud growth. The CCC effect on lateral buds was interpreted as involving a system independent of auxin and GA or else a possible immobilization of auxin in addition to inhibition of GA biosynthesis. <b>Lateral</b> <b>bud</b> development in plants may be resolved into two phases: (1) the phase in which bud break occurs, and (2) the phase of growth following bud break. Apical dominance may be the suppression of either of these phases. The experimental plant Coleus shows <b>lateral</b> <b>bud</b> break under natural conditions but subsequent growth of the lateral buds is retarded by presence of the intact apex.

40|$|Apical {{dominance}} {{appears to}} have minimal direct involvement in daughter bulb formation in the bulbous Iris cultivar Ideal. Daughter bulb number and growth relate to the size and reproductive state of the mother bulb and are not markedly influenced by meristem destruction.
