40|$|The {{most likely}} source of {{exposure}} is ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water. Exposure can also occur via inadvertent ingestion of contaminated soil/dust or lead-based paint. Lead can leach into drinking water from lead-soldered joints or leaded pipes in water distribution systems or individual houses. Lead may also enter foods {{if they are}} put into improperly glazed pottery or ceramic dishes. Some non-Western folk remedies may contain substantial amounts of lead. Some types of hair dyes and cosmetics may contain lead compounds. Other potential sources of exposure are hobbies that use lead: casting ammunition and m fishing weights; soldering with lead solder; making stained glass; using firing ranges. Leaded gasoline is still used in some race cars, airplanes, and off-road vehicles. Occupational Populations Potentially high levels of lead may occur in the following industries: <b>lead</b> <b>smelting</b> <b>and</b> <b>refining</b> industries, battery manufacturing plants, steel welding or cutting operations, construction, rubber products and plastics industries, printing industries, firing ranges, radiator repair shops and other industries requiring flame soldering of lead solder...|$|E

30|$|Industrialization and {{urbanization}} {{have resulted}} in a phenomenal increase in metallic contents in the environment and has emerged as a worldwide environmental problem. Heavy metals are innate constituents of the earth’s crust. Some are fundamental micronutrients for life, but at elevated concentrations they induce rigorous poisoning. Heavy metals are recalcitrant and in no way degrade in environment, but are only transformed and transferred (Satyawali et al. 2011; Hashim et al. 2011; Barka et al. 2013). Lead has no known biological functions. It is referred as a cumulative poison as it leads to biomagnifications at various trophic levels in food chains (Dauvin 2008; Flora et al. 2008; Lombardi et al. 2010). Lead is a mutagenic and teratogenic metal and induces stringent toxic effects such as cancer, hepatitis, neurodegenerative impairment, encephalopathy, renal failure, anaemia, and reproductive damage in living beings (Shahid et al. 2012; Ghazy and Gad 2014). Diverse industrial processes such as <b>lead</b> <b>smelting,</b> <b>refining</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing industries, battery manufacturing, printing and pigment, metal plating and finishing, ceramic and glass industries, and iron and steel manufacturing units are key sources of lead contamination in wastewater (Yurtsever and Sengil 2008; Sahu et al. 2013). Being a precarious neurotoxic metal, 10  µg/L of Pb(II) has been recommended by WHO as secure permissible level in drinking water (Watt et al. 2000; Naik and Dubey 2013). Inorganic form of lead is reviewed as a metabolic poison and enzyme inhibitor; still, organic forms of Pb(II) are extremely noxious (Anayurt et al. 2009; Javanbakht et al. 2011). Several methodologies such as chemical oxidation, electrocoagulation, electrodeposition, filtration, adsorption, chemical precipitation, solvent exchange, photo-degradation and membrane separation technologies have been explored long ago to mitigate recalcitrant heavy metals from adulterated wastewater (Verma et al. 2013; Rasool et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2014; Zewaila and Yousef 2015). But these conventional methods proved unproductive due to their technical or economical constraints (Demir and Arisoy 2007; Cibati et al. 2013; Verma et al. 2015). Biological mechanisms impart a leading edge to current physico-chemical methods to wipe out noxious heavy metals from polluted waste water as they are eco-friendly, cost effective and do not produce colossal quantities of sludge (Cirik et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014). Recently, biogenic sulphate reduction has been developing as an innovative bioprocess to remediate sulphate and heavy metals from effluents (Barrera et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Sanchez-Andrea et al. 2014). Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) metabolize organic matter in rigorous anaerobic environment using sulphate as an electron acceptor and subsequently results in generation of hydrogen sulphide and bicarbonate. This biogenic sulphide quickly reacts with heavy metal ions and finally transforms them into insoluble metal sulphides (Bratkova et al. 2013; Hao et al. 2014). SRB also possess other budding advantages such as they can reduce heavy metals directly by enzymatic approach and also endowed with high extracellular metal-binding capacity to accomplish bioremediation (Bridge et al. 1999; Pagnanelli et al. 2010; Sahinkaya et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014). The present work aims at the study of influence of electron donors and optimization of bioprecipitation process to explore perfect conditions for efficient removal of Pb(II) and COD from simulated waste water. Therefore, the objective of current research is to present an effective method for treating Pb(II)-loaded wastewater with COD removal.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Present day lead {{pollution}} is an environmental hazard of global proportions. A correct determination of natural lead levels {{is very important}} in order to evaluate anthropogenic lead contributions. In this paper, the impact of mining <b>and</b> <b>smelting</b> of <b>lead</b> metal ores on environmental quality is described. Globally mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is {{only a small fraction of}} the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of lead, causes the greatest degradation of the environment. Lead smelters release large quantities of Cd and Pb into the environment as well as <b>smelting</b> <b>and</b> <b>refining</b> produce gaseous (CO 2, SO 2, NOx, etc.) and particulate matter emissions, sewage waters, and solid wastes; however, these pollutants take a lead to effects human health. A quantitative evaluation of the environmental health effects of <b>lead</b> mining <b>and</b> <b>smelting</b> is difficult because of the complexity of factors involved and lack of consistent methodology. Nevertheless, the investigation indicates that negative health effects could arise from <b>lead</b> mining <b>and</b> <b>smelting...</b>|$|R
