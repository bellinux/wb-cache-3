5000|$|In September 1965 the Renault 10 Major (branded in some {{markets as}} the Renault 1100) was launched, {{replacing}} the Renault 8 Major. This was a lengthened {{version of the}} Renault 8 with an increased front overhang and a much enlarged front <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment,</b> its <b>capacity</b> increased from 240 to 315 litres. The dimensions of the central passenger cabin were unchanged, however. The 1,108 cc engine, which for some markets had already appeared in {{top of the range}} versions of the Renault 8, came from the Renault Caravelle. In the French market the Renault 10 found itself struggling to compete with the successful Peugeot 204 introduced in the same year. In the United States the Renault 10 was offered as [...] "The Renault for people who swore they would never buy another one." ...|$|R

30|$|The seam bond {{inspection}} {{system has been}} integrated as the last station in the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> door production system. The inspection speed, means the speed the robots moves the door thru the seam bond sensor is actual set to 30  mm/s. Due to time restriction by the cycle time and time needs for handling the part the achievable inspection length is approximately 1  m in one cycle step of 90  s. Consequently, a complete inline check is not possible in the actual state. Instead, different over-lapping sections of seam bond areas are tested in successive <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> doors so that the complete seam has been tested after four successive <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> doors.|$|R
