25|$|The Delta IV {{entered the}} space <b>launch</b> <b>market</b> when global {{capacity}} was already {{much higher than}} demand. Furthermore, as an unproven design it has had difficulty finding a market in commercial launches, and the cost to launch a Delta IV is higher than that for competing vehicles. In 2003, Boeing pulled the Delta IV from the commercial market, citing low demand and high costs. In 2005, Boeing stated that it sought to return the Delta IV to commercial service.|$|E

25|$|ESA has a {{fleet of}} {{different}} launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the <b>launch</b> <b>market.</b> ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: Ariane 5, Soyuz-2 and Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by Arianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as CNES, at ESA's Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.|$|E
25|$|As the {{successor}} of ELDO, ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. Ariane 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next {{two versions of}} the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages {{in the development of a}} more advanced launch system, the Ariane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding Ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space <b>launch</b> <b>market</b> with 56 successful launches as of September 2011. The successor launch vehicle of Ariane 5, the Ariane 6, is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s.|$|E
2500|$|SpaceX's low launch prices, {{especially}} for communication satellites flying to geostationary (GTO) orbit, {{have resulted in}} market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices. Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat <b>launch</b> <b>market</b> had been dominated by Arianespace (flying Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying Proton). With a published price of [...] per launch to low Earth orbit, [...] "Falcon 9 rockets [...] already the cheapest in the industry. Reusable Falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude, sparking more space-based enterprise, which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale." [...] SpaceX has publicly indicated {{that if they are}} successful with developing the reusable technology, launch prices in the [...] range for the reusable Falcon 9 are possible.|$|E
