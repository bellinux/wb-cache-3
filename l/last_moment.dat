5|$|Every year it is {{becoming}} more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E

5|$|Factionalism {{returned}} {{in full force}} as the Progressive Conservatives fell from power in 1963, and while Diefenbaker's performance as Opposition Leader was heralded, his second loss at the polls prompted opponents within the party force him to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party leader at the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> but only attracted minimal support and withdrew. He remained an MP {{until his death in}} 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the first Tory Prime Minister since Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E

Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home {{in the attempt to}} kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear. Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where, coincidentally, Booth was then staying.|$|E
5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed overboard to make room for more helicopters to land. Other helicopters dropped off their passengers and were then ditched into the sea by their pilots, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> to be picked up by rescue boats.|$|E
5|$|The First Afro-Asian Games {{were held}} {{after nearly two}} decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The {{prolonged}} amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them.

At the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> New Delhi was outfavoured by Hyderabad, which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the <b>last</b> <b>moment.</b> Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{success was}} widely applauded, though {{the story of}} Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its {{achievement}} in the United Kingdom. Amundsen's decision to keep his true plans secret until the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> was criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that of Scott.|$|E
5|$|The three-pronged {{government}} {{lasted only}} from May to December 1992, as Panić and Ćosić decided to challenge Milošević in institutionally-revised elections in December that same year. The December election {{ended up as}} a failure for the opposition to Milošević, as Ćosić {{pulled out of the}} campaign in the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> due to health problems. Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions {{in the midst of a}} cold 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him.|$|E

5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E

5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled {{to wipe out the}} remains of Peter's existence. But at the <b>last</b> <b>moment</b> September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the <b>last</b> <b>moment,</b> additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
