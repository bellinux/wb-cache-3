5|$|Evancho saw {{the film}} version of the musical The Phantom of the Opera and <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that her mother {{purchased}} the DVD; Evancho began singing the songs at home. Her parents have said that they did not recognize that her voice was unusual until her first talent competition, which she entered just before her 8th birthday. In the competition, Kean Idol, Evancho finished in second place. She began taking voice lessons and singing at various events, churches and nursing homes, mostly in Pennsylvania. She also started a YouTube channel, sang in the Children's Festival Chorus of Pittsburgh (now Pittsburgh Youth Chorus) during its 2008–09 season, and performed the title role in a 2009 school musical version of Little Red Riding Hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
25|$|Brighton's {{transformation}} from fishing village to high-class, fashionable spa town and resort {{happened in the}} second half of the 18th century and was prompted by several factors. Sea-bathing and drinking seawater became an upper-class fad, encouraged by the publication in 1750 of local doctor Richard Russell's book on the subject. The good climate—sunny, mild and breezy—also became widely known when Brighton's first guidebook was published by Anthony Relhan in 1761. Road improvements encouraged visitors from London and elsewhere: the road from London to Brighton, notorious for its poor (sometimes impassable) condition, was turnpiked throughout its length in 1770. The arrival of royalty and the effects of their patronage then gave the town such prestige that it became Britain's largest and most important seaside resort. The Duke of Cumberland lived in the town from 1779; the Prince of Wales first visited him in 1783 (although he may also have come in search of Brighton's reputed health benefits); and he <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he came back every year and eventually took up residence at the Royal Pavilion.|$|E

500|$|However, {{according}} to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke {{decided to play}} on the crew while the cameras were rolling. Wellman <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he left it in. TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke's ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy. [...] "He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1935, Parker Brothers sent {{a copy of}} {{the game}} to Victor Watson, Sr. of Waddington Games. Watson and his son Norman tried the game over a weekend, and <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that Waddington took the (then extraordinary) step of making a transatlantic [...] "trunk call" [...] to Parker Brothers, the first such call made or {{received}} by either company. This impressed Parker Brothers sufficiently that Waddington was granted licensing rights for Europe and the then-British Commonwealth, excluding Canada. Waddingtons version, their first board game, with locations from London substituted for the original Atlantic City ones, was first produced in 1936.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team's {{decision to}} write an episode about stand-up comedy was influenced by comedy festivals. The writing staff initially had trouble getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through network censors, but convinced them this was simply a way to emphasize his old and dated comedic material. The [...] "Canyonero" [...] sequence was modeled after Ford commercials and was given its own segment {{at the end of}} the episode because the production staff <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> The episode was highlighted by USA Today in a review of The Simpsons ninth season and received positive reviews in The Washington Times, the Evening Herald, and in books on The Simpsons.|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US). Dinosaur Jr.'s version has a faster tempo and showcases the band's loud and distortion-heavy sound. The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> we didn't {{want to give it}} to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how we play it live".|$|E
500|$|Koshiro's track, [...] "Wrath of the Reset Bomb", {{used the}} motif {{associated}} with Viridi, {{which would be}} reused in multiple tracks. According to Sakurai, it was only intended {{to be used in}} one level, but he <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he made it the theme for Viridi's Forces of Nature. A track that went through multiple redrafts was [...] "Aurum Island", the theme associated with the titular alien invaders: while every attempt made to create a theme ended up as a [...] "techno-pop song", the tune underwent multiple adjustments so it would not clash {{with the rest of the}} soundtrack while retaining its form. [...] "Lightning Chariot Base", due to the size of the level, was designed so players would notice its presence without growing tired of it. [...] "Practice Arena", the tune for the pre-multiplayer training area, was designed by Takada to have a light, analogue feel; it was originally composed for a different unspecified area, but it was decided that it fitted well with the build-up to a multiplayer match.|$|E
500|$|The second video, {{created to}} {{accompany}} the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and [...] "Lithium". Cobain's original concept for the video {{told the story of}} a young girl born into a Ku Klux Klan family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being [...] "so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously [...] [...] [...] I wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us". Kerslake filmed the video on old Kinescope cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host (played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court) introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of screaming teenagers; their non-stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as [...] "thoroughly all right and decent fellas", perform dressed in Beach Boys-style outfits; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> he kept it that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.|$|E

500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
2500|$|After {{a two-year}} break, Fluke {{returned}} with what became a breakthrough into mainstream popular music when, in 1993, they released the single [...] "Slid". This became an instant club classic {{when it was}} picked up by DJ Sasha who <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he included three separate remixes of it on his Renaissance album. This burst of success was followed by two further singles, [...] "Electric Guitar" [...] (...) and [...] "Groovy Feeling", and, in the same year, the release of the group's second album, Six Wheels On My Wagon.|$|E
2500|$|Shankar {{recorded}} [...] "I Am Missing You" [...] for Shankar Family & Friends (1974), {{his first}} full studio album with Harrison as his producer. Two recordings of the song were made for the album, since, as Shankar recalled: [...] "George <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{he wanted to do}} a version of his own." [...] For this version, Harrison arranged the song [...] "for a rock band", author Peter Lavezzoli writes, using multiple drummers. The latter was one element of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique that Harrison had recently employed on [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] and other songs on his self-produced Living in the Material World album.|$|E

Lloyd Braun suggests this idea to Mayor Dinkins, who <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he adds it to his campaign, subsequently leading to his loss in the mayoral elections. In [...] "The Gum", it's revealed that Lloyd Braun also loses his job and later had a mad fit.|$|R

2500|$|Anderson and Wilson {{wrote the}} role of Mr. Blume with Bill Murray in mind but doubted they could get the script to him. Murray's agent was a fan of Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, and urged the actor to read the script for Rushmore. Murray <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he agreed to work for scale, which Anderson {{estimated}} to be around $9,000. The actor was drawn to Anderson and Wilson's [...] "precise" [...] writing and felt {{that a lot of}} the film was about [...] "the struggle to retain civility and kindness in the face of extraordinary pain. And I've felt a lot of that in my life". Anderson created detailed storyboards for each scene but was open to Murray's knack for improvisation.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Hancock also {{composed}} the score to Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blowup (1966), {{the first of}} many film soundtracks he recorded in his career. [...] As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then well known products as Pillsbury's Space Food Sticks, Standard Oil, Tab diet cola and Virginia Slims cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of F. William Free commercials for Silva Thins cigarettes. [...] Hancock <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him. [...] He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track [...] "He Who Lives in Fear" [...] from his The Prisoner album of 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo was as big a step as going in to record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{six months}} after their introduction, in June 1998, the newly {{appointed}} executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, {{made the decision to}} axe Luisa and Bruno. They were among a large number of characters to be axed by the producer in 1998, reportedly in a bid to reverse EastEnders plummeting ratings. Other axed characters included Sanjay, Gita and Neelam Kapoor, George Palmer, Ruth Fowler, Michael and Susan Rose and Chris Clarke. At the time it was the biggest cast cull in the soap's history, and the axings continued into 1999 with the departures of characters such as Simon Raymond, Lenny Wallace, Tony Hills and the retirement of original character, Dr. Legg. [...] In total, 26 characters were culled over a period of 21 months, which earned Robinson a reputation for being [...] "ruthless". In the serial, Luisa suffered a stroke, and so she and Bruno decided to travel to Italy to see their [...] "homeland" [...] before it was too late. Once there, they <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they decided to stay. They supposedly departed in December 1998, but Luisa's last appearance was in November—her departure was explained away by her husband. The two characters survived less than a year on-screen.|$|E
2500|$|When {{producer}} Peter Guber {{was developing}} Innerspace, {{a film about}} an explorer who is miniaturized and sent into another man's body, he hired a young writer named Chip Proser to write a script for the story. Director Joe Dante thought the story was too much like Fantastic Voyage, and didn't want to direct it. Guber later took the story to Warner Bros. with executive Bruce Berman. Director John Carpenter was briefly attached to the project. Warner Bros. asked Boam to rewrite the script, but he initially refused. [...] "I balked at it," [...] Boam said, [...] "I didn't even think the premise had much merit." [...] Carpenter convinced Boam {{there was a good}} story to tell, and Boam wrote a draft. He said, [...] "I took the premise and basically invented everything else." [...] Eventually Carpenter left the project to direct Big Trouble in Little China, and Dante joined as director. Dante said that Boam's screenplay was [...] "a wonderful script... completely the opposite of the first. It was... imaginative, funny, clever..." [...] Dante was pleased that the new script was not a [...] "rip off" [...] of Fantastic Voyage. He said that although both Boam and Proser share writing credit for the film, it was Boam [...] "who really wrote the picture." [...] The script was given to Steven Spielberg, who <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> he agreed to produce the film.|$|E
2500|$|GLaDOS {{was written}} {{with the intent}} of making her more {{understandable}} and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of Portal, described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for Portal allowed the writers enough time to let players get to know GLaDOS. Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been [...] "done to death". He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are [...] "putting her through the wringer emotionally". The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> they chose to use it for GLaDOS. Valve described GLaDOS' actions in Portal 2 as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, {{and the only way to}} accomplish this is by testing her.|$|E
5000|$|Aukerman's {{lyrics to}} [...] "Pervert" [...] dealt with his {{conflicting}} feelings about his libido: [...] "'Pervert' {{is about how}} I like to have sex, but sometimes I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I think I'm perverted", {{he said in a}} mid-1980s interview. [...] "Sometimes I want to have sex <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I think I'm a pervert, so that's why I wrote the song.
