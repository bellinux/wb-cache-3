The report of a viral variant which contained FPV- and CPV-specific epitopes stresses the importance of the mechanism of multistep mutation in the production <b>of</b> <b>new</b> variants and in the emergence <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>viruses.</b> This type <b>of</b> multistep adaptation has already been documented during the emergence of CPV and on the basis of our results, it was hypothesized that CPV had presumably started a <b>new</b> process <b>of</b> readaptation in the feline host, confirming the importance of viral host switching as a mechanism for the emergence <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Inside cells, viruses build {{specialized}} compartments for replication and morphogenesis.

Cultured adherent cells were infected with a bunyavirus and processed for oriented sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. Imaging of cell basal regions showed sophisticated multilamellar structures (MLS) and extracellular filament bundles with attached viruses. Correlative light and electron microscopy confirmed that both MLS and filaments proliferated during the maximum egress <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>viruses.</b> MLS dimensions and structure were reminiscent of those reported for the nanostructures on gecko fingertips, which are responsible for the extraordinary attachment capacity of these lizards.

50|$|Specificity in {{the life}} cycle of cacao {{necrosis}} virus, in contrast to other plant pathogenic viral pathogens, has not yet been studied. The virus is assigned to the genus Nepovirus and is most likely transmitted by needle nematodes (Longidorus spp.). Once the virus is inside the plant cell, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. The RNA is duplicated in viroplasms. A double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome is created from single stranded RNA (ssRNA). The transcribed dsRNA creates new messenger RNAs and ssRNA genomes. This allows for assembly <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>viruses</b> in the viroplasms. The <b>new</b> <b>viruses</b> are encapsulated in newly synthesized proteins which are able to facilitate transport from the infected cell to other cells.|$|R
