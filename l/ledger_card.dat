50|$|As a {{major part}} of the Corps {{activity}} centered around procurement, provisioning and stores accounting, moves were taken in the mid 1960s to replace stubby pencils and rubbers with the introduction of NCR accounting Machines. The MD310 <b>Ledger</b> <b>card</b> would be the accountable record of the item held in stock. When transactions occurred, the card would be removed from its bin in the ledger office, sent to the machine room, updated on NCR-33 and later NCR-299 machines, once complete the card would be returned to the Ledger office. This was a standalone process with no external outputs. In the early 1970s an ICL computer system was introduced, this provided a paper tape from the accounting machine which would then be uploaded daily in to a mainframe to provide provisioning and reporting data.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adding machine}} range {{began with the}} basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design {{included}} some revolutionary features, foremost {{of which was the}} dashpot. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the [...] "J" [...] series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the [...] "c" [...] series of both manual and electrical assisted comptometers. In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored [...] "nixi-tube" [...] provided an electronic display calculator. Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the Sensimatic, which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain ledgers. It could store 9, 18 or 27 balances during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the Sensitronic which could store balances on a magnetic stripe which was part of the <b>ledger</b> <b>card.</b> This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting card reader/punches and a line printer.|$|E

2500|$|For instance, [...] {{proposed}} {{a summary of}} requisitions as an aid in posting to stores ledgers and cost records. In this same area of accounting for raw materials, Nicholson was an exponent {{of the use of}} a true perpetual inventory system. He did not originate this idea, but brought it to a high stage of perfection, designing raw materials <b>ledger</b> <b>cards</b> which had spaces not only for amounts and values, but also for items received and requisitioned, with the balance on hand indicated." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1962, NCR {{introduced}} the NCR-315 Electronic Data Processing System {{which included the}} CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic <b>ledger</b> <b>cards,</b> punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.The company's first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300. The Century series {{was followed by the}} Criterion series in 1976, NCR's first virtual machine system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the Corps, stores {{accounting}} relied upon manually raised vouchers and entries into <b>ledger</b> books and <b>cards.</b> This was detailed work and required much attention to detail and over the years the Corps would be criticized for lax accounting procedures.|$|R

40|$|Transcript, 92 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] an NCR employee since l 946, surveys the company's growth from {{a manufacturer of}} cash registers {{to one of the}} largest suppliers of business computers. He begins with NCR's l 946 experiments with vacuum tube arithmetic devices, work during the Korean war on the A- 1 -A bombing navigational system, and the acquisition in 1952 of the Computer Research Corporation. Rench points to Joseph Desch's role in moving NCR into electronics. Rench highlights the major products of the l 950 s: the Post-Tronic machine for reading magnetic strips on <b>ledger</b> <b>cards</b> and doing financial transactions, and the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) device. He mentions a l 959 joint venture with General Electric to produce one of the first all-transistorized business computers. He explains how, in the 1960 s, NCR returned to its earlier specialty in peripheral devices, and contrasts this approach with IBM's concentration on the sale of systems. Rench focuses on the company in the early 1970 s as a major producer of metal oxide semicon- ductor chips and as a multinational corporation. He discusses at length NCR president William Anderson's decentralization of the company, the resistance among Dayton employees, and the advantages of this policy to the company's livelihood...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{resources available}} for {{and number of}} partners providing health sector aid have stimulated innovations, notably, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which aim to improve aid coordination. In this, {{one of the first}} studies to analyse implementation of aid coordination below national level, the aim was to investigate the effect of the Paris Declaration on coordination of health sector aid at the district level in Zambia. Methods The study was carried out in three districts of Zambia. Data were collected via interviews with health centre staff, district managers and officials from the Ministry of Health, and from district action plans, financial reports and accounts, and health centre <b>ledger</b> <b>cards.</b> Four indicators of coordination related to external-partner activity, common arrangements used by external partners and predictability of funding were analysed and assessed in relation to the 2010 targets set by the Paris Declaration. Findings While the activity of external partners at the district level has increased, funding and activities provided by these partners are often not included in local plans. HIV/AIDS support show better integration in planning and implementation at the district level than other support. Regarding common arrangements used for fund disbursement, the share of resources provided as programme-based support is not increasing. The predictability of funds coming from outside the government financing mechanism is low. Conclusion Greater efforts to integrate partners in district level planning and implementation are needed. External partners must improve the predictability of their support and be more proactive in informing the districts about their intended contributions. With the deadline for achieving the targets set by the Paris Declaration fast approaching, {{it is time for the}} signatories to accelerate its implementation. </p...|$|R

50|$|The two Martin {{brothers}} went to New York City and Darwin {{obtained a}} job selling soap. Martin then came by himself to Buffalo {{to work in}} the Larkin Company as the first, and at that time the only, hired office-worker of the Larkin Company, as all office work was done by Larkin himself. One of the figures in the company who Martin admired was Elbert Hubbard, an executive. Martin worked ferociously, putting in 361 workdays a year. His efforts enabled the company to expand and rival Sears and Roebuck Co.. He is credited with converting all the company customer records from cumbersome <b>ledgers</b> to efficient <b>card</b> catalogs, a pioneering advance in business record-keeping at the time. In 1890, Darwin D. Martin replaced Hubbard as Corporate Secretary of Larkin Company. One of his assignments was to find an architect to design a new administrative building for the expanding company. His brother, William Martin, who was living in Chicago, recommended a young architect named Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|R
40|$|Background: Inventory {{management}} {{is the important}} pillar of the pharmaceutical supply system. Problems in inventory management system generally features with ad hoc decision about order frequency and quantity, inaccurate stock records and lack of system performance monitoring and consequently shortage of pharmaceuticals in the health facilities. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the pharmaceutical logistics system performance in Pemba public health facilities. Methodology: The study was a cross-sectional survey that involved twenty eight health facilities and two warehouses. Inventory keeping records over a period of one year, from January to December 2012, were reviewed. Data on storage condition and HWs’ knowledge on logistics were collected using storage condition check list and questionnaire respectively. Data on medicine expiry were collected based on recorded data and physical counting. Results: The average percent of time out of stock for all health facilities combined was 31 %, at ZILS department store was 13. 2 % and at the Zonal Central Medical Store was 14. 4 %. Percentage of accurate stock records was 70. 6 % in health facilities that were using pull supply system, 64. 9 % in those facilities which were using push supply system, and 47. 3 % in facilities which were using bulky supply system (DHs). Storage condition in 52. 2 % of the PHCUs was unacceptable. Conclusion: Health facilities in Pemba, within a year, faced stock outs of a number of pharmaceutical products. Stock keeping records were also not perfectly accurate. It is recommended that training should be conducted to all health workers involved in the management of pharmaceuticals, on the basics of pharmaceutical store management with due emphasis on record keeping and specifically the proper use of store <b>ledgers</b> and bin <b>cards...</b>|$|R
