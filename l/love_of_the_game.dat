His father was a keen amateur cricketer and an instilled a <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in his six sons, all of whom played for Fitzroy in Victorian Premier Cricket. Harvey made his first class debut {{in the middle of the}} 1947–48 season, and played his first two matches for Victoria {{alongside}} his more decorated brothers Merv and Neil. However, he performed poorly and did not play a match in the following summer and for the two subsequent seasons, he played in only three games but contributed little to his team's cause. In 1951–52 he made five appearances, gaining selection only when Victoria's Test players were busy representing Australia. The following season, he gained selection for the last three matches and broke through for his maiden first-class century, having never previously passed 50.|$|E

The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played for the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

25|$|Deciding that {{he wanted}} a {{parliamentary}} career, Churchill pursued political contacts and gave addresses at three Conservative Party meetings. It was also {{at this point that}} he courted Pamela Plowden; although a relationship did not ensue, they remained lifelong friends. In December he returned to India for three months, largely to indulge his <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> polo. While in Calcutta, he stayed for a week in the home of Viceroy George Nathaniel Curzon. On the journey home, he spent two weeks at the Savoy Hotel in Cairo, where he was introduced to the Khedive Abbas II, before arriving in England in April. He refocused his attention on politics, addressing further Conservative meetings and networking at events such as a Rothschild's dinner party. He was selected as one of the two Conservative parliamentary candidates at the June 1899 by-election in Oldham, Lancashire. Although the Oldham seats had previously been held by the Conservatives, the election was a narrow Liberal victory.|$|E

40|$|The GAA, {{since its}} humble {{beginnings}} in Thurles 1884, {{has long been}} <b>the</b> bedrock <b>of</b> Irish sporting culture.

The organization has prided itself on its ability to draw crowds and players from all around the country to play for merely <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> and to exact a sense of pride in a community. Yet as players become more and more entranced on a fixation of winning and success the boundaries for preparation would appear to be stretched to the limit. The GAA have always had a strict ethos of “playing without paying”, yet this status of amateurism has become more contentious over the past 10 - 20 years. Players are now expected to exert themselves for arguably the entire calendar year with <b>the</b> ultimate objective <b>of</b> winning.

In the midst of the 1988 playoffs, Anderson's friend, Dr. George Varvis, died after falling into Anderson's pool. His friend's death inspired his on-ice production. He scored 9 goals, and 16 assists for a total of 25 points to help the Oilers win their fourth Cup. His 16 assists tied a career high.

500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{wanted to}} {{contrast}} Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As {{a sequel to}} the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than {{he did when he}} voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations. During recording, Sakurai was told that [...] "o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken." [...] Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling [...] "deflated", as the [...] "exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful", Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with straight talk. Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes. According to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of VII, Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording Crisis Core, Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a Final Fantasy VII fan himself, he is happy to contribute.|$|E
