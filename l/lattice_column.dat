40|$|The {{buckling}} and post-buckling {{behavior of}} a simply supported <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> with distributed micro- structure is theoretically and numerically investigated. This problem differs from the nonlinear {{behavior of a}} <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> composed of concentrated microstructure, {{as illustrated by the}} Hencky-bar chain system. It is shown that the problem based on a distributed microstructure is mathematically equivalent to the Finite Element formulation of the continuous elastica with linear rotation interpolation functions. The buckling load of this <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> with distributed microstructure is analytically obtained by solving a linear difference boundary value problem. This linearized difference boundary value problem is asymptotically approximated by a continuum gradient elasticity boundary value problem with de fi nite positive equivalent energy functional. The geometrically exact nonlinear behavior of this microstructured column with distributed microstructure is governed by a strongly nonlinear difference equation, which has not been reported in the literature to the authors ’ knowledge. Bifurcation diagrams of the micro- structured column composed of few cells are numerically obtained with the simplex algorithm. It is shown that the post-buckling of the <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> with distributed microstructure reveals complex behavior similarly to the post-buckling of a <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> with concentrated microstructure. The fi rst post-buckling branch of the lattice system is compared to that of the gradient elastica problem and good correlations are found. The paper is concluded by a general analysis on the effect of concentrated and distributed microstructures at the macroscopic structural scale: Hencky-bar chain system composed of concentrated microstructure asymptotically behaves as a nonlocal (stress gradient) elastic column, whereas the <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> composed of distributed microstructure asymptotically behaves as a gradient elasticity (strain gradient) elastic column...|$|E

The connectors were placed between the two cold-formed thin-walled C steel embedment. This type of connectors is different to the normal connectors such as studs, channels and bent-up bars, which are widely used in the past. Its structural form is similar to batten plate or lace bar of the double-limb <b>lattice</b> <b>column</b> in the steel structure, which can effectively improve the overall stability between the two C-Channels. While it is used in the composite structures, it also can effectively improve the shear resistance of the composite members. The positions of connectors are set between flanges or webs.

Laboratory push-out tests have been carried out on foam concrete and C-Channels with shear connectors to study the increasing of shear bearing capability.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Replacement {{dolomite}} in the Latemar carbonate buildup, northern Italy, {{formed when}} limestone was infiltrated by and reacted with Mg-rich fluid. It occurs in discrete bodies in sharp contact with unreacted limestone. The dolomite {{developed in a}} nearly orthogonal <b>lattice</b> of vertical <b>columns</b> (replacement of limestone breccia pipes) and sheets (replacement along fractures and limestone-dike contacts) and of nearly horizontal bedding-parallel sheets and tubes. Mapped patterns of replacement dolomite directly image {{that part of the}} plumbing system in which the amount of fluid flow was sufficient to form dolomite. Decreases in the proportion of dolomite relative to limestone and in the proportion of vertical relative to horizontal dolomite-limestone contacts with increasing elevation indicate that the overall direction of fluid flow was upward and then outward along more permeable bedding horizons. Dolomite is significantly enriched in Fe, Mn, and Zn, as well as in Mg, relative to calcite in precursor limestone but not in Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Ba, or Pb.

40|$|The {{expansive}} polystyrene granule cement (EPSC) latticed {{concrete wall}} is {{a new type of}} energy-saving wall material with load-bearing, insulation, fireproof, and environmental protection characteristics. A series of shaking table tests were performed to investigate the seismic behavior of a full-scale reinforced concrete (RC) frame with EPSC latticed concrete infill wall, and data obtained from the shaking table test were analyzed. The experimental results indicate that the designed RC frame with EPSC latticed concrete infill wall has satisfactory seismic performance subjected to earthquakes, and the seismic responses of the model structure are more sensitive to input motions with more high frequency components and long duration. The EPSC latticed concrete infill wall provided high lateral stiffness so that the walls can be equivalent to a RC shear wall.

40|$|How does knowledge, i. e. innovations, diffuse over space? Traditional {{diffusion}} theory {{does not consider}} this question, but instead focuses on diffusion over time. After some early publications such as Gerschenkron (1962) and Abramovitz (1979), research on technology diffusion over countries was deepened during the 1980 s. This literature became known as technology gap literature. Main argument of this literature is that technology is regarded to spread to a country due to specific characteristics of that country. The countries between which spillover of knowledge takes place, need not necessarily be geographically close to each other, therefore geographic proximity does not play a substantive role in this literature. The so called spatial factors like agglomeration economies and growth poles as used by geographers were not addressed in this set of theories. Only the geographic stream of researchers used these concepts. Within the field of geography, diffusion {{is regarded as a}} purely geographical process and space is a central concept. Scale effects and proximity effects are considered to be the main vehicles which carry the spread of economic activity. This paper develops a theoretical model which tries to explain the development of growth poles, by allowing knowledge spillovers to take place across regions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} integrate both streams in the literature (technology gap and geography). The lack of space as an explaining factor in technology gap models is addressed in this paper by extending a simple technology gap model with the concept of geographical distance. The geographical distance towards another region partly determines the amount of spillovers one region receives from another. This paper extends the 'traditional' technology gap models also in a second way, by considering more than two regions. Three geographical spheres are considered, namely a <b>lattice,</b> a <b>column</b> and a globe. Depending on the geographical sphere that is used, 19, 21 or 32 regions are considered. Several theoretical experiments are performed on the different geographical spheres to illustrate the behavior of the model.

The model consists of an input lattice organized as a three-digit hand forward-connected to a <b>lattice</b> of cortical <b>columns</b> each of which contains a paired excitatory and inhibitory cell. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity of feedforward and lateral connection weights is implemented as a simple covariance rule and competitive normalization. Receptive field properties are computed independently for excitatory and inhibitory cells and compared within and across columns. Within digit representational zones intracolumnar excitatory and inhibitory receptive field extents are concentric, single-digit, small, and unimodal. Exclusively in representational boundary-adjacent zones, intracolumnar excitatory and inhibitory receptive field properties diverge: excitatory cell receptive fields are single-digit, small, and unimodal; and the paired inhibitory cell receptive fields are bimodal, double-digit, and large. In simulated syndactyly (webbed fingers), boundary-adjacent intracolumnar receptive field properties reorganize to within-representation type; divergent properties are reacquired following syndactyly release. This study generates testable hypotheses for assessment of cortical laminar-dependent receptive field properties and plasticity within and between cortical representational zones. For computational studies, present results suggest that concurrent excitatory and inhibitory plasticity may underlie novel emergent properties...|$|R
