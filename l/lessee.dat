5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's <b>Lessee,</b> 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's <b>Lessee,</b> 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's <b>Lessee</b> as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E
5|$|Studies by English Heritage {{have found}} that the site {{originally}} functioned not only as the manorial court hall for Ruislip, but also as a working farm. The main building was built over two existing structures, possibly to accommodate the new <b>lessee</b> of the manor, Robert Drury, a former Speaker of the House of Commons. The study concluded this was most likely achieved by a team of masons and carpenters. Manor Farm was also known as Ruislip Court until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s the <b>lessee</b> at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E

"The survey results, {{printed with}} the Committee’s evidence, {{underpinned}} the Committee’s findings. 64 per cent of <b>lessees</b> {{did not think}} their pubco added any value and while a fifth had had a dispute with their pubco, few (18 per cent) {{were satisfied with the}} outcome. The Committee was astonished to learn that 67 per cent of the <b>lessees</b> surveyed earned less than £15,000 pa and over 50 per cent of the <b>lessees</b> who had turnover of more than £500,000 pa earned less than £15,000 - a 3 per cent rate of return. The <b>lessees</b> may share the risks with their pubco but they do not appear to share the benefits.The report therefore concludes that problems which were identified by the Trade and Industry Committee four years ago remain. An imbalance of bargaining power between <b>lessees</b> and pubcos persists and the arrangements for assessing rents remain opaque. Rental assessment should be the basis for negotiation, but incumbent <b>lessees</b> often risk the loss of their home as well as their business if they cannot reach agreement, the report says." ...|$|R

50|$|Winters continued:Many of {{the white}} <b>lessees</b> showed far less regard for their hired Negro laborers than the most negligent planter had shown for his slave. Negroes old, or infirm, or too young were weeded out and sent to Federal {{contraband}} villages and camps located along the river, where {{they had to be}} cared for by the provost marshals. In 1863 few <b>lessees</b> paid their labor except in food and clothing. For these items they often charged the Negroes five times the actual value, {{and at the end of}} the year the Negro was told that nothing was due him. Some <b>lessees</b> realized up to $80,000 profits, paid their labor nothing, and then boasted of their ability to swindle the Negro. A few <b>lessees</b> used their plantations for shipping out stolen cotton or for illegal trade. Provost marshals and labor agents often were bribed to shut their eyes to malpractices carried on by the <b>lessees.</b>|$|R

Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War. One such <b>lessee,</b> Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around £4,000 maintaining and upgrading the property, and the rentable value of the property rose from £76 to £150 over the period.|$|E

Castle House fell empty after the death of its final <b>lessee,</b> James Geenway; the house was then briefly requisitioned in 1942 by the Royal Air Force and turned into flats for key war workers, causing extensive damage later estimated at £2,000. In 1956, Castle House was de-requisitioned and sold by the Earl of Powis the following year to Ludlow Borough Council for £4,000, which rented out the flats.|$|E

Speyer put up the necessary funds, encouraged Newman and Wood to continue with their project of musical education, and underwrote the Proms and the main Symphony Concert seasons. Newman remained manager of the hall until 1906 and manager of the concerts until he died in 1926.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its <b>lessee</b> merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, <b>lessee</b> to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E

TransNordic Group started negotiations in June with Braathens SAFE, Maersk Air and Conair of Scandinavia for them to join the alliance.

5|$|The {{economic}} growth across South Wales {{drove up the}} demand for new housing for the growing workforce. Bute {{was not prepared to}} sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the <b>lessee</b> to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease {{at the end of this}} term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. Very little money was invested in the sewage and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town.|$|E

50|$|The {{lawsuit was}} finally settled in court on 18 November 1634 by an {{agreement}} between the parties stipulating that Sir Matthew Brend would draw up a new lease granting an extension of nine years to run from 25 December 1635, and that the <b>lessees</b> would pay an increased rent of £40 per year and would guarantee to leave the Globe in good repair {{at the end of}} that term. However Brend did not draw up a new lease, and on 25 December 1635 the original lease and the 6-year extension granted by Bodley expired. The <b>lessees</b> offered Brend the old rent, but he refused to accept it, and as a result received no rent for the next two years although the <b>lessees</b> were still in possession of the Globe. In mid-1637 Brend finally drew up a new lease, to run for nine years from 25 December 1635, but the <b>lessees</b> refused to accept it, stipulating that the new lease and the new rent of £40 per year payable under it should now only run from 25 December 1637. Brend went back to court, and obtained an order mandating that the <b>lessees</b> accept the new lease. The <b>lessees</b> then sought another court hearing, and obtained an order requiring them to pay the new rent for only one of the two years in contention, and that the new lease was now to run for eight years from 25 December 1636. Although no record that the new lease was finally signed survives, the <b>lessees</b> appear to have been secure in their possession of the Globe until 25 December 1644. However before that date the English Civil War intervened, and in 1642 the playhouses were closed, rendering the final two years of the new lease moot.|$|R
