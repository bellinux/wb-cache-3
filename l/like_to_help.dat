5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and the dreams of the crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken the Engineer. He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and the Engineer decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises {{to take her to the}} Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the mutagen to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at the Engineer temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the human embryos and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{she held}} a meeting at Clarence House which brought {{together}} rape victims and rape support groups. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Theresa May were guests at the occasion. At the occasion, she introduced a plan to help the victims. About 750 wash-bags, packed with luxury toiletries, were distributed to victims at the centres. Her staff at Clarence House created the wash-bags. The Duchess thought of the gesture after she visited a centre in Derbyshire and asked victims what they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them feel at ease after the trauma and forensic examinations. According to Clarence House, the event was {{the first meeting of}} high-profile figures to focus exclusively on rape and sexual abuse subjects. The same year, the Duchess travelled to Northern Ireland and opened The Rowan, a sexual assault and referral centre at Antrim Area Hospital which was the first centre to provide help and comfort to rape and sexual abuse victims in Northern Ireland. In March 2016, during a tour to the Western Balkans with her husband, the Duchess visited UNICEF programmes in Montenegro and while there, she discussed child sexual abuse and was shown an exclusive preview of a new app designed to protect children from online sexual abuse.|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Girls Aloud {{initially}} provided backing vocals for [...] "My Love Is Better". Annie received tabloid {{attention when}} various publications wrote that Girls Aloud requested [...] "My Love Is Better" [...] {{be removed from}} the album.

Annie told Digital Spy in an interview that [...] "it's not as dramatic as they said in the papers", citing problems with the record company.

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lakers {{started the}} season with a 21–3 record, and they {{received}} accolades as the greatest NBA team ever. However, the Lakers lost Malone for three months to a knee injury during the winter. During the All-Star break, Buss suspended contract negotiations with Jackson, who was seeking to double his salary from $6 million to $12 million on his expiring contract. Jackson had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it. [...] The Lakers also suspended talks with O'Neal, who wanted an extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. The Los Angeles Times wrote that both of the Lakers moves were a concession to Bryant. The Lakers slid towards mediocrity during the spring. Injuries hampered Los Angeles, keeping them as the fourth seed in the Western Conference midway through the season. The team never came together defensively. Winter said, [...] "Even though Shaq was a big presence, he was not a great shot blocker. And he didn't like to play the screen and roll, so he put his teammates in jeopardy. He didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> [...]" [...] In March, after Bryant received internal criticism about his shot selection, he scored just one point while taking three shots in the first half against Orlando which the Lakers trailed by 11. He scored 37 in the second half and tied a team record with 24 in the fourth quarter as the Lakers won in overtime. Against Sacramento in April, Bryant took just one shot in the first half against tight defense. He finished the game with eight points. An anonymous teammate told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I don't know how we can forgive him." [...] Afterward, Jackson urged Bryant to be more aggressive offensively.|$|E
