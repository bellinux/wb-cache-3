5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their <b>low</b> <b>drag.</b> RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E
60|$|Far away in {{the silence}} of the house we heard a <b>low,</b> <b>dragging,</b> {{shuffling}} sound, and the distant tread of feet. She closed and fastened the case in an instant.|$|R
25|$|The wing {{twist and}} belly {{fairings}} are tweaked {{to approach the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> elliptical span-wise pressure distribution changed by the larger sharklets, like the flap track fairings shape to lower form drag.|$|R
5000|$|Lateen rig {{features}} a triangular sail {{set on a}} long yard, mounted at an angle on the mast and running in a fore-and-aft direction. This {{is one of the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> (windage) sails.|$|R
25|$|The appearance, still {{based on}} the cab forward {{exterior}} design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the Concorde a <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient which was ahead of its time.|$|E
25|$|The Aerodynamics Team is {{responsible}} for designing and constructing the outside shell of the vehicle. At most speeds, much of the power to drive the car is spent on air resistance. Thus, a shell with a <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient must be built. In addition, much of the vehicle construction involving lightweight composite materials {{is done by the}} Aerodynamics Team.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of new parts and concepts onto the vehicle design {{are easier to}} include when in the design stage of a vehicle, rather than in aftermarket (automotive) parts, however, the fabrication of these parts assists in the streamlining of the vehicle and can help greatly reduce the drag of the vehicle. Most vehicles with very <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficients, such as race cars and high efficiency concept cars, apply these ideas to their design.|$|E
50|$|A clean flying wing is {{sometimes}} presented as theoretically the most aerodynamically efficient (<b>lowest</b> <b>drag)</b> design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft. It also would offer high structural efficiency {{for a given}} wing depth, leading to light weight and high fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|On {{the right}} {{we see the}} {{reference}} results for the drag coefficient of the airfoil, based on {{a large number of}} CFD simulations. Note that the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag,</b> which corresponds to 'optimal' performance, is close to the undeformed 'baseline' design of the airfoil at (0,0).|$|R
50|$|Reducing {{aerodynamic}} drag was another primary design goal. One of the car's aerodynamic features {{resulted in a}} new patent application. The result is the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient (Cd) in its class: depending on drivetrain and options, the car's Cd ranges from 0.27 to 0.31.|$|R
25|$|Advanced {{aerodynamics}} {{also contributed}} to the car's very <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient of 0.29– quite low even for modern cars. This accomplishment is all the more remarkable considering the engineers did not enjoy the benefits of computer-aided design or wind tunnel testing. The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.|$|E
25|$|The wheeled {{undercarriage}} was {{a simple}} single-axle arrangement, with oleo legs forward to the engine bulkhead and rearward bracing struts {{to the root of}} the rear wing spar. There was a rather long tailskid to protect the downward-extended fin. The seaplane version used a pair of floats, their <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> profile refined via Schneider Trophy experience, cross braced with a pair of horizontal transverse struts. They were mounted with N-shaped struts which sloped strongly outwards from the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|For a {{streamlined}} body {{to achieve a}} <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient, the boundary layer around the body must remain attached {{to the surface of}} the body for as long as possible, causing the wake to be narrow. A high form drag results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower viscosities contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.|$|E
40|$|Results of an {{exploratory}} free-flight investigation at zero lift of several rocket-powered drag-research models having rectangular 6 -percent-thick wings are presented for a Mach number range of 0. 6 to 1. 7. Wings of aspect ratio 2. 7 having diamond, circular-arc, and blunt-trailing edge airfoil sections were tested. Pressures were measured {{on the base}} of the blunt-trailing-edge airfoil which had a rectangular section with a 40 -percent-chord beveled leading edge. Although the blunt-trailing-edge airfoil had high drag throughout the Mach number range investigated, because of high base suction pressures, it is believed that the data presented can be used in the design of more nearly optimum blunt-base airfoils. Of the airfoils tested the circular-arc section had <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> at high-subsonic speeds, and the diamond section had <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> at supersonic speeds.

50|$|A {{monoplane}} has inherently {{the highest}} efficiency and <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> of any wing configuration {{and is the}} simplest to build. However, {{during the early years}} of flight, these advantages were offset by its greater weight and lower manoeuvrability, making it relatively rare until the 1930s. Since then, the monoplane has been the most common form for a fixed-wing aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Calibra {{was well}} received, notably for its sporty {{although}} cramped interior (largely {{based on the}} interior of the Cavalier) and its streamlined styling which in turn enabled the Calibra to have the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient of the period at 0.26 for the 8v model (0.29 for the rest) - a record it held for the next 10 years.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was completely}} smooth, {{with a high}} fineness ratio for <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> at supersonic speeds. The design was developed prior {{to the discovery of}} the area rule, and does not display any of the wasp waisting common to aircraft primarily developed after 1952. The fuselage contours were mainly cylindrical, but blended into the intake starting around the wing root, giving it a rounded, rectangular profile through the middle, before reverting to a pure cylinder shape again at the engine nozzle.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado borrows {{from the}} design of the Earthstar Thunder Gull J and shares a similar {{cantilever}} wing of small area, keeping stall speeds low by use of flaps. This <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> design manages high cross country speeds as a result. The cockpit is constructed from 4130 steel, while the fuselage boom tube and the wings are built from aluminium. Unlike the Gull's wing, which is aircraft fabric-covered or optionally finished in sheet aluminium, the Tornado's wing is stressed skin. The Tornado has a tricycle undercarriage with a supplemental tailwheel castor, as the aircraft sits on its tail when unoccupied.|$|E
25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E
50|$|The 105 series Giulia {{was quite}} an {{advanced}} car, using such technologies as all-wheel disc brakes, and a plastic radiator header tank. It had also the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient (Cd) in its class The same trend continued with the Alfetta 2000 and GTV, which had such things as 50:50 weight distribution, standard fit alloy wheels and transaxle.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} claimed to feature <b>low</b> wave <b>drag,</b> high subsonic {{efficiency}} and {{little or no}} sonic boom.|$|R
50|$|The Audi A2 1.2 TDI had the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} of any {{car in the}} world {{at the time of its}} launch. It was also one of the most economical and least polluting, only emitting 81 g/km (German emission standard D4) to 86 g/km (D3 emission standard) CO2 emissions. The Audi A2 3L reuses the engine and special gearbox developed for the equally efficient Volkswagen Lupo 1.2 TDI 3L.|$|R
25|$|Designed as a {{small and}} {{inexpensive}} commuter/utility aircraft, various cabin configurations and equipment loadouts are available to suit {{a wide variety of}} different purposes, including charter flights, scheduled flights, agricultural uses, aerial firefighting, air freight VIP/executive transport, aerial surveillance air ambulance, paradropping, and law enforcement. The design programme can be entirely personalized, allowing each customer to be involved in every area of the aircraft's manufacture to mold it to their preferences. Later versions of the Islander offer various options, including enlarged bay doors, 3-bladed scimitar propellers, <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> fairings, modern interior, ergonomic leather seating, in-flight entertainment systems, and alternative seat arrangements; underwing hardpoints can also be installed for carrying pod, spray booms and other external stores.|$|E
25|$|The F40 was {{designed}} with aerodynamics in mind. For speed the car relied more on its shape than its power. Frontal area was reduced, and airflow greatly smoothed, but stability rather than terminal velocity was a primary concern. So too was cooling as the forced induction engine generated {{a great deal}} of heat. In consequence, the car was somewhat like an open-wheel racing car with a body. It had a partial undertray to smooth airflow beneath the radiator, front section, and the cabin, and a second one with diffusers behind the motor, but the engine bay was not sealed. Nonetheless, the F40 had an impressively <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient of 0.34 with lift controlled by its spoilers and wing.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Charles Richard Fairey, {{founder and}} chief {{designer}} of Fairey Aviation, disappointed with his Fawn bomber, which {{owing to the}} constraints of Air Ministry specifications, was slower than the Airco DH.9A which {{it was meant to}} replace while carrying no greater bombload, conceived the idea of a private venture bomber not subject to official limitations, which could demonstrate superior performance and handling. On seeing the Curtiss CR, powered by a Curtiss D-12 V-12 liquid-cooled engine of low frontal area and in a <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> installation, win the 1923 Schneider Trophy race, Fairey realised that this engine would be well suited to a new bomber and acquired an example of the engine and a licence for production.|$|E
40|$|Results of a wind-tunnel {{study of}} the effect of pylon {{cross-sectional}} shape and tow angle on airplane drag and an aft-mounted nacelle are presented. The 1 / 24 -scale wide-body high-wing transport model was tested in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at free-stream Mach 0. 7 - 0. 8 and angles of attack from - 3 to 4 degrees. A compression-type pylon is found to have the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> at both Mach 0. 7 and 0. 8 and to be capable of suppressing the velocities in the inboard region of the pylon-wing junction, reducing the extent of supersonic flow and the probability of flow separation. It is also shown that the D-shaped aft-mounted nacelle has a <b>low</b> interference <b>drag,</b> as do previously tested circular nacelles in the same position...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{calculations}} of the viscous and pressure drags of some two-dimensional supersonic airfoils at zero lift are presented. The {{results indicate that}} inclusion of viscous drag alters many previous results regarding the desirability of certain airfoil shapes for securing <b>low</b> <b>drags</b> at supersonic speeds. At certain Reynolds and Mach numbers, for instance, a circular-arc airfoil may theoretically have less drag than the previously advocated symmetrical wedge-shape profile; although under different conditions, the circular-arc airfoil may have a higher drag...|$|R
50|$|Theoretical {{advantages}} of the tailless configuration include <b>low</b> parasitic <b>drag</b> as on the Horten H.IV soaring glider and good stealth characteristics as on the Northrop B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|R
25|$|A {{natural use}} of the turbocharger— and its {{earliest}} known use for any internal combustion engine, starting with experimental installations in the 1920s— is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air quickly falls off. At 5,486 m (18,000ft), the air is at half the pressure of sea level and the airframe experiences only half the aerodynamic drag. However, since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure, the engine normally produces only half-power at full throttle at this altitude. Pilots would like {{to take advantage of the}} <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> at high altitudes to go faster, but a naturally aspirated engine does not produce enough power at the same altitude to do so.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, John J. Montgomery, an American {{trained in}} physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with {{circulating}} {{water and a}} smoke chamber he began applying the physics of fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became {{the first person to}} reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Renard and German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. Otto Lilienthal, following the work of Sir George Cayley, {{was the first person to}} become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and <b>low</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the Filper Corporation {{acquired}} {{rights to the}} Copperfield Corporation {{as well as the}} Gyroflex system, providing Orr with stable funding to continue development of the concept. Orr continued his work with J. Ford Johnston as chief engineer, J. Eric Rhodes, chief project engineer, and Irv Culver and John Turner as assistants. The Filper Helicopter (N9712C) was developed as a proof-of-concept testbed that led to the Filper Beta 100A, a tandem rotor design with a two-seat cabin and pylon at the rear, and the engine with the forward pylon in front. This unique arrangement resulted in the pilot and passenger being located {{at the rear of the}} helicopter. The fuselage was highly streamlined and the addition of retractable tricycle landing gear allowed for a <b>low</b> <b>drag</b> design.|$|E
60|$|The beasts had now {{apparently}} made {{up their}} minds to attack. They crouched <b>low,</b> almost <b>dragging</b> their bellies on the ground, and one was somewhat in advance of the other.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation in}} the Langley Gas Dynamics Laboratory {{has been made of}} the flow separation from slender rods mounted to extend forward along the axes of symmetry of blunt-nosed bodies. The mechanism of the separation and its governing criteria are discussed. Drag data at a Mach number of 2. 72 for various rod lengths and nose radii at an angle of attack of zero degrees are presented. It was found that the drag coefficients of blunt noses could be appreciably reduced by the use of protruding rods. Criteria for rod length which gives <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> are given.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the off-design drag and pressure performance of three axisymmetric supersonic inlets in the transonic speed range. For typical engine airflows at Mach 0. 8 the drag coefficient varied from 0. 045 to 0. 09; at Mach 1. 2 the largest drag coefficient measured was 0. 25. Below Mach 0. 9 a lower drag resulted when all or {{at least part of}} the excess weight flow was spilled over the cowl rather than through the bypass doors; above Mach 1. 1 the <b>lowest</b> <b>drag</b> was obtained by bypassing excess flow...|$|R
