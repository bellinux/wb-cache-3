25|$|Both flights {{had been}} routine until they {{approached}} the islands. At 1:15 pm, a bomb (planted by the separatist Fuerzas Armadas Guanches) exploded in the terminal of Gran Canaria International Airport, injuring one person. There had been a phone call warning of the bomb, and soon after another call claimed that a second bomb was at the airport. The civil aviation authorities had therefore closed the airport temporarily after the bomb detonated and diverted all of its incoming flights to Los Rodeos, including the two Boeing 747 aircraft involved in the disaster. The Pan Am crew {{indicated that they would}} prefer to circle in a holding pattern until <b>landing</b> <b>clearance</b> was given, but were ordered to divert to Los Rodeos.|$|E
25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a <b>landing</b> <b>clearance.</b> If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach {{as if he had been}} properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E

40|$|Pattern-forming tendencies and patternforming phases in the {{development}} of the rural cultural landscape since high medieval times, especially in north west Germany. The arteile deals with the problem of temporal divisions in {{the development}} of the cultural landscape since high medieval times. Following on from studies made by H. Overbeck and H. Jäger, an attempt is made, with the help of various criteria, to reveal the most important pattern-forming tendencies and to temporally demarcate them. The basis of the division lies in an attempt to serialise different types of form, in the various difficulties involved in the process and with the spatial Organisation of the cultural landscape. The periods of high medieval agricultural expansion (and, after the retreat phenomena of the late middle ages, the expansion of modern times) can each be divided into three phases (in which the dates should be interpreted as mean values) : 1000 - 1070 : small-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearance,</b> non-uniform settlement types. 1070 - 1230 : large-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> under the influence of territorial rulers, uniform settlemcnt types. 1230 - 1350 : large-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearance,</b> streng urban influence on the form of the cultural landscape. 1350 - 1450 / 1500 : late medieval retreat periods, pronounced social and economic changes. 1450 / 1500 - 1700 : small-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearance,</b> non-niform settlement types. 1700 - 1850 : large-scale <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> under the influence of the State, uniform settlement types. 1850 - 1950 : expansion and improvement of existing settlements, strenger urban influence. 1950 -till today: mereasing fallow phenomena and decrease in farm numbers, strong social and economic restructuring. The phased changes in pattern-forming tendencies reflect, during the settlement expansion periods, the building up of a sectoral and spatial social and economic order, while a caesura occurred with the retreat phenomena...|$|R
