5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in <b>layer</b> V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to <b>layer</b> V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from <b>layer</b> V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in <b>layer</b> VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in <b>layer</b> VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in <b>layer</b> VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in <b>layer</b> V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear <b>layer</b> which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary <b>layer,</b> while the Blasius boundary <b>layer</b> refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary <b>layer,</b> a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman <b>layer</b> forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary <b>layer</b> occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary <b>layer</b> simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|Rocks on Mars {{have been}} found to {{frequently}} occur as <b>layers,</b> called strata, in many different places. Columbus Crater is one of many craters that contain <b>layers.</b> Rock can form <b>layers</b> in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce <b>layers.</b> [...] Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in <b>layers.</b> Scientists are happy about finding <b>layers</b> on Mars since <b>layers</b> may have formed under large bodies of water. <b>Layers</b> may be formed by groundwater rising up depositing minerals and cementing sediments.

5|$|Above the {{transport}} <b>layer,</b> {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets <b>Layer</b> (SSL) and Transport <b>Layer</b> Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application <b>layer,</b> are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a <b>layer</b> of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium {{proved to be the}} best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium <b>layer,</b> which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base <b>layer</b> of chromium.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary <b>layer.</b> This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary <b>layer</b> inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary <b>layer</b> transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary <b>layer</b> away through a porous surface (see Boundary <b>layer</b> suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary <b>layer</b> transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
5000|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{are composed}} of many overlapping <b>layers,</b> each defined by photolithography, and normally shown in different colors. Some <b>layers</b> mark where various dopants are diffused into the substrate (called diffusion <b>layers),</b> some define where additional ions are implanted (implant <b>layers),</b> some define the conductors (polysilicon or metal <b>layers),</b> and some define the connections between the conducting <b>layers</b> (via or contact <b>layers).</b> All components are constructed from a specific combination of these <b>layers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{superior}} colliculus/optic tectum forms a {{major component}} of the midbrain. It is a <b>layered</b> structure, with a number of <b>layers</b> that varies by species. The <b>layers</b> can be grouped into the superficial <b>layers</b> (stratum opticum and above) and the deeper <b>layers</b> (the remaining <b>layers).</b> Neurons in the superficial <b>layers</b> receive direct input from the retina and respond almost exclusively to visual stimuli. Many neurons in the deeper <b>layers</b> also respond to other modalities, and some respond to stimuli in multiple modalities.

5000|$|In {{the visual}} system, signals {{for the most}} part travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then to the visual cortex.

5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside <b>layer</b> was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second <b>layer.</b> This second <b>layer</b> prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third <b>layer</b> was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final <b>layer</b> from damage caused by the hydrogen.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This <b>layer</b> where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary <b>layer,</b> sometimes the Ekman <b>layer,</b> and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary <b>layer</b> as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary <b>layer</b> by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear.
