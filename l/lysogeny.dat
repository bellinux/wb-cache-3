5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as <b>lysogeny</b> broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting <b>lysogeny.</b> Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} distinction {{here is that}} between the two decisions; <b>lysogeny</b> and lysis on infection, and continuing <b>lysogeny</b> or lysis from a prophage. The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed, as no cI protein {{will be allowed to}} build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lysogeny</b> is {{maintained}} solely by cI. cI represses transcription from PL and PR while upregulating and controlling its own expression from PRM. It is therefore the only protein expressed by lysogenic phage.|$|E
25|$|The cIII protein acts {{to protect}} the cII protein from {{proteolysis}} by FtsH (a membrane-bound essential E. coli protease) by acting as a competitive inhibitor. This inhibition can induce a bacteriostatic state, which favours <b>lysogeny.</b> cIII also directly stabilises the cII protein.|$|E
25|$|Leftward {{transcription}} {{expresses the}} gam, red, xis, and int genes. Gam and red proteins {{are involved in}} recombination. Gam is also important in that it inhibits the host RecBCD nuclease from degrading the 3’ ends in rolling circle replication. Int and xis are integration and excision proteins vital to <b>lysogeny.</b>|$|E
25|$|On initial infection, the {{stability}} of cII determines the lifestyle of the phage; stable cII {{will lead to the}} lysogenic pathway, whereas if cII is degraded the phage will go into the lytic pathway. Low temperature, starvation of the cells and high multiplicity of infection (MOI) are known to favor <b>lysogeny</b> (see later discussion).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the {{lysogenic}} cycle {{does not}} result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo <b>lysogeny</b> are known as temperate phages. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a plasmid. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the endogenous phages (known as prophages) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated {{in all of the}} cell’s offspring.|$|E
500|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he went back}} to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the [...] "Bundaberg disaster", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated diphtheria vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a royal commission to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified Staphylococcus aureus in the toxin-antitoxin mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of <b>lysogeny</b> was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of Max Delbrück, Alfred Hershey and Salvador Luria on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
2500|$|A full biophysical {{model for}} lambda's lysis-lysogeny {{decision}} {{remains to be}} developed. Computer modeling and simulation suggest that random processes during infection drive the selection of lysis or <b>lysogeny</b> within individual cells. [...] However, recent experiments suggest that physical differences among cells, that exist prior to infection, predetermine whether a cell will lyse or become a lysogen.|$|E
2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through <b>lysogeny</b> or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} a cell to be {{transformed}} by a virus, the viral DNA must be entered into the host cell. [...] The simplest consideration is viral transformation of a bacterial cell. [...] This process is called <b>lysogeny.</b> [...] As shown in Figure 2, a bacteriophage lands on a cell and pins itself to the cell. [...] The phage can then penetrate the cell membrane and inject the viral DNA into the host cell. [...] The viral DNA can then either lay dormant until stimulated by a source such as UV light {{or it can be}} immediately taken up by the host's genome. [...] In either case the viral DNA will replicate along with the original host DNA during cell replication causing two cells to now be infected with the virus. [...] The process will continue to propagate more and more infected cells. [...] This process is in contrast to the lytic cycle where a virus only uses the host cell's replication machinery to replicate itself before destroying the host cell.|$|E
50|$|The model {{organism}} {{for studying}} <b>lysogeny</b> is lambda phage. Prophage integration, maintenance of <b>lysogeny,</b> induction, {{and control of}} phage genome excision in induction is described in detail in the lambda phage article.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lysogeny</b> broth (LB), a nutritionally rich medium, is {{primarily}} {{used for the}} growth of bacteria. The initialism is also commonly, albeit incorrectly, taken to mean Luria broth, Lennox broth, or Luria-Bertani medium. According to its creator Giuseppe Bertani, the abbreviation LB was actually intended to stand for <b>lysogeny</b> broth. The formula of the LB medium was published in 1951 in the first paper of Bertani on <b>lysogeny.</b> In this article he described the modified single-burst experiment and the isolation of the phages P1, P2, and P3. He had developed the LB medium to optimize Shigella growth and plaque formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{starting}} E. coli culture {{volume is}} 15-25 mL of <b>lysogeny</b> broth (LB) and the expected DNA yield is 100-350 µg.|$|E
50|$|The (p)ppGpp {{levels of}} the host seem {{to act as a}} sensor for phage lambda development, {{primarily}} affecting transcription. Modest ppGpp levels inhibit pR and active pE, pI, and paQ promoters in vivo and have effects in vitro that seem to favor <b>lysogeny.</b> In contrast, absent or high concentrations of (p)ppGpp favor lysis. Modest ppGpp levels favor <b>lysogeny</b> by leading to low HflB (FtsH). When ppGpp is either absent or high, HflB protease levels are high; this leads to lower CII (a lysogeny-promoting phage protein)and favors lysis.|$|E

50|$|This family {{consists}} of several bacterial and phage Ail/Lom-like proteins. The Yersinia enterocolitica Ail protein is a known virulence factor. Proteins {{in this family}} are predicted to consist of eight transmembrane beta-sheets and four cell surface-exposed loops. It is thought that Ail directly promotes invasion and loop 2 contains an active site, perhaps a receptor-binding domain. The phage protein Lom is expressed during <b>lysogeny,</b> and encode host-cell envelope proteins. Lom {{is found in the}} bacterial outer membrane, and is homologous to virulence proteins of two other enterobacterial genera. It has been suggested that <b>lysogeny</b> may generally have a role in bacterial survival in animal hosts, and perhaps in pathogenesis.|$|E
50|$|A {{productive}} infectious cycle begins {{before a}} lysogenic cycle establishes {{the virus in}} the infected bacteria. After initial infection of the viral genome the virus may become latent within the host. <b>Lysogeny</b> involves integration into the host chromosome.|$|E
50|$|A plasmid {{cloning vector}} is {{typically}} used to clone DNA fragments {{of up to}} 15 kbp. To clone longer lengths of DNA, lambda phage with <b>lysogeny</b> genes deleted, cosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes, or yeast artificial chromosomes are used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{repressor}}: The repressor {{is needed}} to repress the lytic cycle for <b>lysogeny</b> to proceed. It has 2 N domains that bind the DNA via a helix turn helix motif and 2 C domains that dimerize to stabilize the protein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lysogeny,</b> or the {{lysogenic}} cycle, {{is one of}} two {{cycles of}} viral reproduction (the lytic cycle being the other). <b>Lysogeny</b> is characterized by integration of the bacteriophage nucleic acid into the host bacterium's genome or formations of a circular replicon in the bacterial cytoplasm. In this condition the bacterium continues to live and reproduce normally. The genetic material of the bacteriophage, called a prophage, can be transmitted to daughter cells at each subsequent cell division, and at later events (such as UV radiation or the presence of certain chemicals) can release it, causing proliferation of new phages via the lytic cycle. Lysogenic cycles can also occur in eukaryotes, although the method of DNA incorporation is not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|Bacteriophage 186 {{has been}} studied as a model system for {{biological}} switches. The phage can enter two developmental lifecycles called the lytic cycle and <b>lysogeny</b> and knowledge into how the decision between the two developmental routes may extend to other biological systems.|$|E

50|$|The phage {{solutions}} are then tested {{to see which}} ones show growth suppression effects (<b>lysogeny)</b> or destruction (lysis) of the target bacteria. The phage showing lysis are then amplified on cultures of the target bacteria, passed through a filter to remove all but the phages, then distributed.|$|E
5000|$|... cII’s {{primary role}} in the lambda phage {{regulatory}} network is to initiate the repressor establishment cascade. Once <b>lysogeny</b> is established, cII is no longer needed, and thus is turned off. It serves as the switch element for establishing repression of the lytic genes after infection, producing the lysogenic phenotype.|$|E
50|$|In virology, {{temperate}} {{refers to}} the ability of some bacteriophages (notably coliphage λ) to display a lysogenic life cycle. Many (but not all) temperate phages can integrate their genomes into their host bacterium's chromosome, together becoming a lysogen as the phage genome becomes a prophage. A temperate phage is also able to undergo a productive, typically lytic life cycle, where the prophage is expressed, replicates the phage genome, and produces phage progeny, which then leave the bacterium. With phage the term virulent is often used as an antonym to temperate, but more strictly a virulent phage is one that has lost its ability to display <b>lysogeny</b> through mutation rather than a phage lineage with no genetic potential to ever display <b>lysogeny</b> (which more properly would be described as an obligately lytic phage).|$|E

50|$|Viruses in Luz24likevirus are non-enveloped, with an {{icosahedral}} head (63 nm) {{and a short}} tail (12x8 nm). Although these phages produce {{small and}} turbid plaques, all attempts to isolate stable lysogenic P. aeruginosa clones failed. In addition, their genome (around 45kb) does not encode obvious genes indicative of <b>lysogeny.</b> Genomes are linear, around 45kb in length.|$|E
50|$|Super Optimal Broth (SOB medium) is a nutrient-rich {{bacterial}} growth medium used for microbiological culture, generally of Escherichia coli.
