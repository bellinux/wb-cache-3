A Historical Background The history of leasehold property ownership in England has its roots in feudalism, a system of land use and ownership that was common in Europe between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, and introduced in England following the Norman Conquest. Land was owned and controlled by a military or political sovereign ruler, who gave parts of that land to a number of lords as “tenants-in-chief, ” or “tenants-in-capite. ” The lord, in turn, could allow another person, a vassal, to use smaller portions of the land for a fixed period of time in return for pledging allegiance an...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introduction}} {{is to provide a}} brief outline of the scope and the progression of the thesis. Since {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century, it has been a well-established principle of real property law in England and Wales that the burden of a positive covenant cannot run directly with freehold land at law or in equity. The fact that a positive covenant cannot run directly with freehold land has for many years been acknowledged to be a major defect of English land law. In Chapter I, the rules which govern the enforceability of freehold covenants are examined. Further, the chapter identifies why the Judges in the nineteenth century decided not to permit the burden of a positive covenant to run with freehold land. Conveyancers use a number of techniques and devices in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle. However, none of them are foolproof. In Chapter II, a number of devices which are used by conveyancers in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle are examined and evaluated. The difficulties which can arise from the present law's failure to provide a satisfactory means whereby positive covenants may be made to run with freehold land are identified in Chapter III. Local authorities possess a number of statutory powers to impose positive covenants on freehold land and to enforce them against successive owners. In Chapter IV, consideration is afforded to some aspects of their powers in this regard. The need to reform the present law has long been recognised. However, despite the fact that several Reports have been made and one draft Bill produced reform has still not been achieved. In Chapter V, the major proposals made for reform in the 1960 's and 1970 's are considered. Further, reasons are advanced to explain why reform of the law of positive covenants has proved to be so difficult to secure. One of the main consequences of the present law is that the vast majority of flats in England and Wales are held on long leases. The popular preference is for freehold not <b>leasehold</b> <b>ownership.</b> Several common law countries have comprehensive "condominium" legislation making full provision for rights and obligations, etc., in regard to freehold flats. The relevant legislation of New South Wales and Trinidad and Tobago is examined in Chapters VI and VII respectively. One objective of these chapters is to demonstrate that there are viable alternatives to using leasehold schemes for blocks of flats. In 1984, the Law Commission published their Report on Positive and Restrictive Covenants. Chapter VIII deals with this Report and with a number of other relevant recent development...|$|E

The statute defines “land use regulation” as “a zoning or landmarking law, or the application of such a law, that limits or restricts a claimant’s use or development of land (including a structure affixed to land), if the claimant has an <b>ownership,</b> <b>leasehold,</b> easement, servitude, or other property interest in the regulated land or a contract or option to acquire such an interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(5).|$|R

Expansion continued over the following decades, and by 1586 the Pension had added another two wings around the central court. Around these were several sets of chambers erected by members of the Inn under a <b>leasehold</b> agreement whereby <b>ownership</b> of the buildings would revert to the Inn {{at the end of the}} lease.|$|R
30|$|Australia is {{the seventh}} most forested {{country in the}} world with 125 million {{hectares}} of forest, equivalent to 16 % of Australia’s land area (National Forest Inventory 2013). The total area of Australia’s native forest suitable and available for commercial wood production in 2010 – 2011 was 36.6 million hectares (DAWR 2015). This includes 29.1 million hectares of native forests under <b>leasehold</b> and private <b>ownership</b> (DAWR 2015), a resource that is often minimally managed (Clinnick et al. 2008). Improved silviculture involving thinning from below to release suppressed growth has been mooted to rejuvenate the growth of these forests and to restore their productivity and ecological values (Ryan and Taylor 2006).|$|R
