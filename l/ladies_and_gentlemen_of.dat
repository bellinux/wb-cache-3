5|$|In Belgium, Merrick {{was robbed}} by his road manager and {{abandoned}} in Brussels. He eventually {{made his way}} back to London; unable to communicate, he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves's card on him. Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
25|$|Vicente's oeuvre {{spans the}} years between 1500 and 1536. Most of his plays were {{intended}} for performance at court, where he and the <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the court participated in their production. He wrote no fewer than forty-four pieces, ten {{of which are in}} Spanish, fourteen in Portuguese, and the remainder in mingled Portuguese and Spanish. His plays may be grouped into four main categories: acts, or devotional plays; comedies tragicomedies; and farces.|$|E

He urged the <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>of</b> the jury to assess the {{evidence}} 'dispassionately', and said that it would be unsafe to convict David Gilroy of murder because the case the Crown presented was a circumstantial one.|$|R

500|$|The nativity scene may not {{accurately}} reflect gospel events. [...] With {{no basis in}} the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. [...] Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as Adam and Eve and the serpent, Noah and his animals, the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles. [...] Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the River Jordan, or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted. The art form {{can be traced back}} to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or grape, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.|$|E
2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses [...] Poe's phrase ...by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride. In the opening of the novel, the phrase <b>Ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E

60|$|Now, Old King Cole was a merry old soul, so he soon set all the <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> {{the court}} to dancing, and he himself took off his crown and his ermine robe and laid them upon the throne, while he danced with the prettiest lady present till he was all out of breath.|$|E
60|$|Very {{well and}} very fast the supper went off; no more serious {{difficulties}} occurring, than those which {{arose from the}} incessant demand for clean knives and forks; which made poor Mrs Kenwigs wish, more than once, that private society adopted the principle of schools, and required that every guest should bring his own knife, fork, and spoon; which doubtless {{would be a great}} accommodation in many cases, and to no one more so than to the <b>lady</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>of</b> the house, especially if the school principle were carried out to the full extent, and the articles were expected, as a matter of delicacy, not to be taken away again.|$|R

60|$|She was a fat {{woman in}} an apricot-coloured gown, with a heavily {{powdered}} face, against which her black long-lashed eyes showed like currants in dough.

Two immense animals squatted, {{one on each side}} of the throne--the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger. In a balcony high up in the dome an orchestra played sweet music, and beneath the dome two electric fountains sent sprays of colored perfumed water shooting up nearly as high as the arched ceiling.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not only}} that Slingsby was {{permitted}} to penetrate into the housekeeper's room and tell his story to his social superiors there, though that was an absolutely unprecedented occurrence; what was really extraordinary was that mere menials discussed the affair with the personal <b>ladies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the castle guests, and were allowed to do so uncrushed.

A gentle philanthropy played all over their faces, and their eyes sought eagerly in the passing scene of the humble street for new objects of benefaction.|$|R
