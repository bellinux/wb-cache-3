5000|$|A high-g {{barrel roll}} is a {{combination}} of a loop and a snap roll. A high g barrel roll is a last-ditch defensive maneuver, performed when the attacker has achieved a suitable guns solution, in order to cause an overshoot. The high-g barrel roll is a violent maneuver which is performed much more aggressively than a normal barrel roll. Range is {{critical to the success of}} the roll, and the defender will usually turn very hard, or employ other measures to draw the opponent very close before performing the roll. The roll is executed by applying hard back-stick pressure, creating the high g-forces, and adding hard rudder input to assist the ailerons in rolling the fighter. A high-g barrel roll can be performed [...] "over-the-top", or it can be performed [...] "underneath", which is accomplished by rolling upside-down and beginning the maneuver from the inverted position. The high-g barrel roll is an energy-depleting maneuver that rarely causes the attacker to fly out in front, but usually will result in a flight path overshoot, a flat scissors, or, at the very <b>least,</b> will <b>temporarily</b> disrupt the attacker's aim.|$|R

Through Somhairle's wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1153), several leading members of Clann Somhairle claimed kingship in the Hebrides. In 1248, Eóghan and his second cousin, Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí (died 1268), travelled to Hákon in Norway and requested the title of king in the Hebrides. Hákon subsequently bestowed the title upon Eóghan, and the following year, upon learning of Haraldr Óláfsson's death, Hákon sent Eóghan westward {{to take control of}} the Isles (at <b>least</b> <b>temporarily)</b> on his behalf. Up until this point Eóghan had two overlords: the King of Norway, who claimed the Hebrides; and the King of Scots, who claimed Argyll and coveted the Hebrides. Unfortunately for Eóghan, soon after his return from Norway, Alexander II, King of Scots (died 1249) led an expedition deep into Argyll and demanded that Eóghan renounce his allegiance to Hákon. Eóghan refused to do so and was subsequently driven from his Scottish lordship.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had {{a master plan}} to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the {{remaining}} independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand {{the power of the}} Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14.

5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{participation}} in the baronial reform movement, Gloucester still maintained {{the trust of the}} king. He, Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310–11. In March 1311, while the Ordinances were still in the workings, Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland. There are signs that he might have fallen out with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers. When Gaveston once more returned from exile, however, Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition. The earls divided the country into different parts for defence, and Gloucester was given charge of the south. In June 1312, Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was working in cooperation with Lancaster. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king, appealed to Gloucester, as Gaveston's kinsman, for assistance. Gloucester, however, refused to help, and Gaveston was killed. This act brought the country to the brink of civil war, and Gloucester {{was one of the few}} men who was still trusted enough by both sides to be able to take on a role as mediator. In the following months, he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls, an effort that was at <b>least</b> <b>temporarily</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|Gryposaurus {{is based}} on {{specimen}} NMC 2278, a skull and partial skeleton collected in 1913 by George F. Sternberg from what {{is now known as}} the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, along the Red Deer River. This specimen was described and named by Lawrence Lambe shortly thereafter, Lambe drawing attention to its unusual nasal crest. A few years earlier, Barnum Brown had collected and described a partial skull from New Mexico, which he named Kritosaurus. This skull was missing the snout, which had eroded into fragments; Brown restored it after the duckbill now known as Anatotitan, which was flat-headed, and believed that some unusual pieces were evidence of compression. Lambe's description of Gryposaurus provided evidence of a different type of skull configuration, and by 1916 the Kritosaurus skull had been redone with a nasal arch and both Brown and Charles Gilmore had proposed that Gryposaurus and Kritosaurus were one and the same. This idea was reflected in William Parks's naming of a nearly complete skeleton from the Dinosaur Park Formation as Kritosaurus incurvimanus, not Gryposaurus incurvimanus (although he left Gryposaurus notabilis in its own genus). Direct comparison between Kritosaurus incurvimanus and Gryposaurus notabilis is hindered {{by the fact that the}} incurvimanus type specimen is missing the front part of the skull, so the full shape of the nasal arch cannot be seen. The 1942 publication of the influential Lull and Wright monograph on hadrosaurs sealed the Kritosaurus/Gryposaurus question for nearly fifty years in favor of Kritosaurus. Reviews beginning in the 1990s, however, called into question the identity of Kritosaurus navajovius, which has limited material for comparison with other duckbills. Thus, Gryposaurus has once again been separated, at <b>least</b> <b>temporarily,</b> from Kritosaurus.|$|E

Consequently, sorption water can have survived in the near-surface layers of the Martian soul at mid- and equatorial latitudes over geological time scales, where ice must have been lost by sublimation.

Lieutenant Renato Togni, Guillet’s second-in-command, charged a column of Matilda tanks with his platoon of 30 colonial soldiers; Togni and his men were all killed, but this allowed the remainder of Guillet's force to disengage.

In spring this year the German fiscal position worsened {{more and more and}} it became obvious that the deficit target would – again – be missed. Despite the worsened starting point Germany affirmed to follow its original stability programme and to attain a budget “close to balance” by the year 2004. Thus, consolidation will have to be strengthened and the scope for fiscal policy narrows down. If current fiscal policy is not sustainable, the necessity of consolidation is obvious. However, the mode of consolidation is controversial. The Stability and Growth Pact focuses on converging budget deficits close to balance. For this, short-term oriented consolidation dominates the more medium and long-term oriented aspects of fiscal policy. Generating economic conditions by fiscal policy is at <b>least</b> restricted, maybe <b>temporarily</b> impossible – and shortening the consolidation period increases its costs. A forecast of the government’s financial development in the years 2002 to 2006 shows clearly that the restructuring of revenues and expenditure will show no progress. In particular, the lack of structural reforms will burden Germany’s fiscal situation in the medium-term oriented consolidation period. However: the political self-commitment this spring leaves no scope for alternatives, but to enforce the consolidation. Despite some efforts, the projection concludes that by the year 2004 the budget will show a deficit. ...|$|R

40|$|Because {{people are}} not in {{complete}} control of the physical and social environments they encounter in daily life, {{it is inevitable that}} discrepancies arise between what their identities, goals, and preferences lead them to expect or desire in specific situations and what transpires in those situations. People generally find such discrepancies at <b>least</b> mildly and <b>temporarily</b> unsettling, because they call into question their understanding of how the world works (or could work) or their understanding of their own goals, motives, or behavior. When these discrepancies arise, they generally are met with swift and decisive actions aimed at aligning expectations or desires and reality. These actions, collectively referred to as self-regulation, are the natural, often automatic response of healthy individuals to salient discrepancies between expectation and reality as they per-ceive it. They may involve cognition or behavior, and almost always are attended by affect. Effective self-regulation is the bedrock of healthy psychological functioning. People who routinely are successful at self-regulation benefit from a sense of psychological stability and personal control that allows them to manage their perceptions of themselves and how they are perceived by others. Their behavior typically reflects salient goals and adopted standards of behavior. Departures from these desired states are handled smoothly and effectively. People who routinely fail at self-regulation enjoy none of the psychological benefits that derive from a sense of psychological stability and control and struggle with mild to severe forms of psychopathology.

40|$|National audienceThe {{credibility}} and guarantee {{due to the}} certification mechanism theoretically comes from the control society's independence and expertise. In {{the case of the}} information about the GMO or non GMO character of the food and agricultural products, these conditions are not sufficient, for lack of a stabilized definition of the control methods. However, professionals in the supply chain often turn to certification societies in order to make their exchanges more reliable concerning this information. This article analyses the way certification works in these conditions. It shows that certification societies use the knowledges and agreements which are constructed by the concerned actors, that they work to formalize the good intentions of the certified industrialists, and finally promise a guarantee on the industrial practices thanks their own reputation. Rather than a definitive and universal conclusion of the controversy about the proofs of the GMOs' « absence », certification societies allow a local compromise between the demands for proofs from the customer societies and the investments consented by the suppliers. Turning to certification constitutes then a sufficient proof for industrialists, a sort of conventional agreement. Certification is a private regulation mechanism which is considered, at <b>least</b> locally and <b>temporarily,</b> sufficient not to challenge at any moment the necessary coordination for market exchanges : it's at least considered as more satisfying than the only intervention of public authorities. La crédibilité de la garantie apportée par la certification provient en principe de l'indépendance et de l'expertise de l'organisme de contrôle. Dans le cas de l'information sur la caractéristique OGM ou non OGM des produits agroalimentaires, ces conditions sont insuffisantes, faute de méthodes de contrôle jugées fiables. L'article analyse le fonctionnement de la certification dans ces conditions. Il montre que son succès relatif repose, plutôt que sur une véritable clôture de la controverse sur les preuves de l'« absence » d'OGM, sur un compromis conventionnel entre les exigences des entreprises clientes et les investissements consentis par les fournisseurs. Le recours à la certification constitue un mécanisme de régulation privée considéré, au moins localement et temporairement, comme suffisant pour ne pas remettre en cause incessamment les échanges commerciaux, et en tous cas plus satisfaisant que la seule intervention des pouvoirs publics...|$|R

Indeed, in opposition {{to most of the}} rocks of the martian surface, which have a volcanic origin, bright layered deposits seems to be sedimentary outcrops. Capri Chasma, a canyon located at the outlet of Valles Marineris, exhibits such deposits called Interior Layered Deposits (ILD). A large array of visible and infrared spacecraft data were used to build a Geographic Information System (GIS). We added HiRiSE images, from the recent MRO mission, which offer a spatial resolution of 25 cm per pixel. It allowed the mapping and the analysis of morphologies in the canyon. We highlighted that the ILD are several kilometers thick and flat-top stratified deposits. They overlap the chaotic floor. They are surrounded and cut by several flow features that imply that liquid water was still acting after the formation of these stratified deposits. The density of crater on the floor of Capri Chasma was quantified. The current topography was aged to 3 Gyr. All these morphological information allow us to suggest a plausible geological history for Capri Chasma. We propose that the Interior Layered Deposits have formed during the Hesperian, during or after the opening of the canyon. Some observations argue that water discharges have happened at several times before and just after the formation of the ILD. Liquid water must have {{played a major role in}} the formation of these deposits after 3. 5 Gyr, implying that it was present in surface at <b>least</b> locally and <b>temporarily.</b> If this can be applied to ILD in others canyons of Valles Marineris, it would imply that liquid water was stable in surface or sub-surface during the Hesperian. Or in the actual conditions, with a cold and dry martian surface, long-term standing water bodies are not possible. Thus we suggest that either the climate at the Hesperian was cold, but wetter, or as warm as the Noachian climate, what is less likely. Nevertheless, the global climate change which has occurred at the beginning of Mars history may have been later than announce...|$|R
