25|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to have at least}} three spacecraft if permanent high elevation coverage is needed for a large area <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Russia where some parts are as far south as 45° N. If three spacecraft are used, each spacecraft is active for periods of eight hours per orbit centered at apogee as illustrated in figure 9. The Earth completes half a rotation in 12 hours, so the apogees of successive Molniya orbits will alternate between one half of the northern hemisphere and the other half. For example if the apogee longitudes are 90° E and 90° W, the apogees will alternately serve Europe and Asia (see figures 3 to 5) and next Northern America (see figures 6 to 8). The orbits of the three spacecraft should then have the same apogee longitudes (for example 90° W and 90° E), but pass the apogee with eight hours shift; i.e. the right ascensions of the ascending nodes should be separated with 120°. When one spacecraft has reached the point corresponding to figure 5 (or figure 8) four hours after apogee passage, the next spacecraft has four hours left to reach apogee and having a right ascension of ascending node 120° larger than the previous spacecraft. Said next spacecraft has the visibility displayed in figure 3 (or figure 6) and the switch-over can take place. Note that the two spacecraft at the time of switch-over are separated about 1500km, so that the ground stations only have to move the antennas a few degrees to acquire the new spacecraft.|$|E

According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights.

At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting.
