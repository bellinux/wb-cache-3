5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury.

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among intravenous drug users.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is {{a major cause of}} death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} Utah {{as having the}} lowest rates {{of heart disease and}} cancer in the United States. This fact has been attributed to very low levels of tobacco smoking among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) who make up about 70 % of the state’s population. This study compares <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> during 1994 - 1998 for LDS and non-LDS groups in Utah. Comparisons are made {{for both males and females}} in five, 20 -year age groups.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{in patients who}} were /= 10 years. Neurological assessments were performed according to the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Data on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were analyzed using the ICD- 10 classifications. Differences were calculated using the Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients, with 38 and 62 surviving /= 10 years, respectively, were included. No significant differences in <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were identified between these two groups. In patients surviving >/= 10 years, paraplegia {{was associated with a}} higher life expectancy compared with tetraplegia, 34 and 25 years (p = 0. 008), respectively, and the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were septicemia (n = 14), ischemic heart disease (n = 10), neoplasms (n = 9), cerebrovascular diseases (n = 5), and other forms of heart diseases (n = 5). Septicemia, influenza/pneumonia, and suicide were the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in tetraplegics, whereas ischemic heart disease, neoplasms, and septicemia were the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in paraplegia. CONCLUSION: Our monocentric study showed that in 62 deceased patients with SCI, the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were septicemia, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases.

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (30%) amongst {{women in the}} United States, and {{the leading cause of}} chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> though some of the victims were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It is the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia {{was the most common}} reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the causal mechanism of disease aggregates peculiar to place and ethnicity, mortality data of Yanji city, China (1993) were collected, examined for validity and analyzed. Age standardized, age specific mortality rates and ten <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were compared with 1993 Korean mortality statistics. Age standardized mortality rates for both sexes were highest in Korean-Chinese followed by Koreans and Chinese (the lowest).

Korean-Chinese females had more similar patterns to Chinese females than males did. Differences in mortality rates by <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among groups suggested that hypertensive diseases and respiratory tuberculosis were associated with ethnicity, homicide/injuries inflicted by others, diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease with environment, and others with both ethnicity and environment. These results suggest that a few <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were attributed to either ethnicity or environment whereas most <b>of</b> the ten <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> were attributed to mixed impacts of both ethnicity and environment...|$|R
