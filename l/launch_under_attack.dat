40|$|Earlier {{analyses}} {{assumed that}} all survivable forces could withstand first strikes and retaliate. Only those on alert, at sea, or capable of <b>launching</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> meet that assumption. The sensitivity of those results to non-alert forces is discussed. Reduced alert rates decrease stability indices, primarily by reducing second strikes. Survivable, mobile Russian ICBMs could increase both sides stability. Dealerting hastens expected reductions and {{raises the possibility}} of abuse. And the low-force goal of arms reductions has some poorly understood and awkward attributes...|$|R

50|$|The {{attack was}} cited {{as one of}} a number of {{incidents}} in which mentally disturbed individuals <b>launched</b> violent <b>attacks</b> <b>under</b> the justification of Islamist ideas or slogans. Other examples include Man Haron Monis, the gunman in the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis; and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa. According to psychologists and psychiatrists who study radicalization, jihad propaganda and calls to kill infidels can push mentally disturbed individuals to act, even in the absence of direct or personal contact with radical Islamists.|$|R
50|$|The {{liberation of}} Borneo by the Allied forces began on 10 June 1945 when the Australian Army {{under the command}} of Australian Major General George Wootten <b>launched</b> an <b>attack</b> <b>under</b> the codename of Operation Oboe Six. Labuan became the main {{objective}} for the Allied forces to repossess. Soon, the 9th Division of the Australian Army launched the attack with support from airstrikes and sea bombardments until the capture of the Labuan airstrip. Most of the Labuan island area including the main town of Victoria was under the control of Allied forces within four days of the landing on 10 June. On 9 September 1945, the Japanese Lieutenant General Masao Baba officially surrendered at a place now known as Surrender Point near the Layang-layang beach which he had been brought to the 9th Division headquarters on the island to sign the surrender document in front of the Australian 9th Division Army Commander George Wootten.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} key generation with a helper, which might be subjected to Byzantine attacks. If the helper is not <b>under</b> <b>attack,</b> it will follow the key generation protocol. However, if the helper is <b>under</b> <b>attack,</b> it will modify the messages to mislead the key generation parties. We propose a scheme that can benefit from the helper, if the helper is not <b>under</b> <b>attack,</b> and can detect {{the presence of the}} attack, if the helper is <b>under</b> Byzantine <b>attacks.</b> We show that our key generation scheme can achieve the secret key capacity when the helper is not <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b> At the same time, if the helper is <b>under</b> Byzantine <b>attacks,</b> our scheme can achieve the key rate as if the attacker is a passive eavesdropper.
