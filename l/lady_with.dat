5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France {{who falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the <b>Lady</b> <b>with</b> Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage {{what could have been a}} fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw {{has left}} a varied musical legacy, {{not all of it}} of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair <b>Lady</b> <b>with</b> book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E
5|$|The {{video of}} the song {{features}} {{the majority of the}} film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant <b>lady</b> <b>with</b> a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
