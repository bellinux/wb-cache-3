5|$|Harding {{spoke and}} {{voted in favor}} of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had <b>little</b> <b>place</b> in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, it {{was finally}} conceded that there was <b>little</b> <b>place</b> for horsed cavalry in the Western Front. The {{regiment}} was converted to infantry and joined the 6th Battalion, The Wiltshire Regiment (6th Wilts), fighting in the trenches at Ypres and Cambrai in 1917. In March 1918, the German army mounted its Spring Offensive and 6th Wilts at one point took the whole weight of the offensive at Bapaume. After a week of combat, 6th Wilts (half of whom were ex-RWY) had taken over 500 casualties. In April, they received reinforcements but later that month took another 400 casualties on the Messines Ridge. Shortly after this, {{it was decided to}} disband 6th Wilts as they had effectively ceased to exist. The regiment won 13 battle honours for the First World War, most earned with 6th Wilts.|$|E

This coincided with his second marriage in 1803 to Juliane Marie Ottesen, which was a very happy situation for the aging Abilgaard. He had two sons and a daughter from the marriage. He bought a lovely <b>little</b> <b>place</b> in the country for the family, Spurveskjul (Sparrow Hideaway).|$|E

He learned Turkish and {{developed}} an interest in the Ubykh language and travelled widely in Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus. As a result, {{he became one of the}} premier experts of Caucasian languages to work in French. He compared the Etruscan language with the Caucasian languages. In 1931, he took another position, in Uppsala, Sweden, which allowed him to improve his skills in the Germanic stock of Indo-European.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided to go a little further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this <b>little</b> <b>place</b> called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E

500|$|Otto, Prince of Bavaria, {{was chosen}} as the first King of Greece in 1832, under the name Othon. His arrival in Nafplio, then the Greek capital, was hailed enthusiastically by Makriyannis. This {{attitude}} is exemplified in his Memoirs: [...] The hopes he had for the new regime, however, were soon to be dispelled. King Otho was underage and Bavarian regents were named to rule on his behalf during the first months of his rule. During the regency, Makriyannis came into conflict with the War Minister, the Bavarian Heideck, due to the latter's attitude towards the veterans of the War of Independence. In the newly restructured Greek Army, there was <b>little</b> <b>place</b> left for the irregular bands of klephts. These guerilla-styled fighters had formed the backbone of the Greek forces during the war, and Makriyannis considered their exclusion from the newly formed army disrespectful. Furthermore, most of these men had been left with no resources after their exclusion from the military, and found themselves in a dire financial situation. Makriyannis also believed that the Prime Minister, the Bavarian von Armansperg, was personally responsible for the serious problems faced by the newly formed state. As a consequence, Makriyannis briefly retired from active politics.|$|E

In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role."

I lived in a <b>little</b> <b>place</b> like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E
