40|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{are widely}} used drugs that may {{increase}} the cardiovascular risk by mechanisms not entirely known. While PPIs increase asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels and inhibit nitric oxide production, it is unknown whether impaired vascular redox biology resulting of increased xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity mediates PPIs-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED). We examined whether increased XOR activity impairs vascular redox biology and causes ED in rats treated with omeprazole. We also examined whether omeprazole aggravates the ED found in hypertension. Treatment with omeprazole reduced endothelium-dependent aortic responses to acetylcholine without causing hypertension. However, omeprazole did not aggravate two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) hypertension, nor hypertension-induced ED. Omeprazole and 2 K 1 C increased vascular oxidative stress as assessed with dihydroethidium (DHE), which reacts with superoxide, and by the lucigenin chemiluminescence assay. The selective XOR inhibitor febuxostat blunted both effects induced by omeprazole. Treatment with omeprazole increased plasma ADMA concentrations, XOR activity and systemic markers of oxidative stress. Incubation of aortic rings with ADMA increased XOR activity, DHE fluorescence and lucigenin chemiluminescence signals, and febuxostat blunted these effects. Providing functional evidence that omeprazole causes ED by XOR-mediated mechanisms, we found that febuxostat blunted the ED caused by omeprazole treatment. This study shows that treatment with omeprazole impairs the vascular redox biology by XOR-mediated mechanisms <b>leading</b> to <b>ED.</b> While omeprazole did not further impair hypertension-induced ED, further studies in less severe animal models are warranted.

The aim of this {{retrospective}} study was to analyse the alcohol-related emergency department (ED) admissions among adolescents in all hospitals of distinct areas during a 1 -year period. In each hospital, all ED patients with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of at least 0. 5 g/l were surveyed in a standardised way. Of the 3918 included patients, only 146 (3. 7 %) were < 18 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1. 5 : 1. There was a strong preponderance of weekend and night time admissions. Most of the patients were transported by ambulance (77 % of 138 patients with information on this item). The main reason for ED admittance was depressed level of consciousness (64 %), trauma (12 %), vomiting and/or abdominal pain (12 %), agitation or aggression (4 %), syncope (4 %) and psychological problems (4 %). The context of the alcohol intoxication was related {{to some kind of}} festivity in 85 %, mental problems in 14 % and chronic abuse in 1 %.

40|$|Introduction.   Thirty {{million men}} in the United States suffer from erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) and this number is expected to double by 2025. Considered a major public health problem, which seriously affects {{the quality of life}} of patients and their partners, ED becomes increasingly prevalent with age and chronic smoking is a major risk factor in the development of ED. Aim.   To review available evidence concerning the effects of cigarette smoking on vascular changes associated with decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Methods.   We examined epidemiological and clinical data linking cigarette smoking and ED, and the effects of smoking on vascular NO bioavailability and ROS generation. Main Outcome Measures.   There are strong parallels between smoking and ED and considerable evidence supporting the concept that smoking-related ED is associated with reduced bioavailability of NO because of increased ROS. Results.   Cigarette smoking-induced ED in human and animal models is associated with impaired arterial flow to the penis or acute vasospasm of the penile arteries. Long-term smoking produces detrimental effects on the vascular endothelium and peripheral nerves and also causes ultrastructural damage to the corporal tissue, all considered to play a role in chronic smoking-induced ED. Clinical and basic science studies provide strong indirect evidence that smoking may affect penile erection by the impairment of endothelium-dependent smooth muscle relaxation or more specifically by affecting NO production via increased ROS generation. Whether nicotine or other products of cigarette smoke mediate all effects related to vascular damage is still unknown. Conclusions.   Smoking prevention represents an important approach for reducing the risk of ED. The characterization of the components of cigarette smoke <b>leading</b> to <b>ED</b> and the mechanisms by which these components alter signaling pathways activated in erectile responses are necessary for a complete comprehension of cigarette smoking-associated ED.

It is unknown whether this treatment {{can reduce the}} risk for emergency department (ED) visits for asthma. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether treatment with intranasal steroids or prescription antihistamines in persons with asthma {{is associated with a}} reduced risk for ED visits caused by asthma. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of members of a managed care organization aged greater than 5 years who were identified during the period of October 1991 to September 1994 as having a diagnosis of asthma by using a computerized medical record system. The main outcome measure was an ED visit for asthma. RESULTS: Of the 13, 844 eligible persons, 1031 (7. 4 %) had an ED visit for asthma. The overall relative risk (RR) for an ED visit among those who received intranasal corticosteroids, adjusted for age, sex, frequency of orally inhaled corticosteroid and β-agonist dispensing, amount and type of ambulatory care for asthma, and diagnosis of an upper airways condition (rhinitis, sinusitis, or otitis media), was 0. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 59 - 0. 94). For those receiving prescription antihistamines, the risk was indeterminate (RR, 0. 9; 95 % CI, 0. 78 - 1. 11). When different rates of dispensing for intranasal steroids were examined, a reduced risk was seen in ED visits in those with greater than 0 to 1 (RR, 0. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 57 - 0. 99) and greater than 3 (RR, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 23 - 1. 05) dispensed prescriptions per year. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of nasal conditions, particularly with intranasal steroids, confers significant protection against exacerbations of asthma <b>leading</b> to <b>ED</b> visits for asthma. These results support the use of intranasal steroids by individuals with asthma and upper airways conditions. Robert J. Adams, Anne L. Fuhlbrigge, Jonathan A. Finkelstein and Scott T. Weis...|$|R
40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{apoptosis}} {{occurs at the}} onset of enalapril-induced regression of aortic hypertrophy in SHR. A potential mechanism is the correction of endothelial dysfunction (<b>ED)</b> <b>leading</b> to reduced production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), a potent apoptosis inducer. Stimulants of NO include the precursor L-arginine and the NO synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4), which correct ED in several models. The objective was to examine the relationships between ED and the cell growth/death balance during vascular remodeling induced by enalapril in SHR. SHR, 10 -week-old, received enalapril (ENA: 30 mg. kg− 1. day− 1 p. o.) for 1 or 2 weeks, or a co-treatment of L-arginine (2. 0 g. kg− 1. day− 1 p. o.) and BH 4 (5. 4 mg. kg− 1. day− 1 i. p. twice daily) administered alone (group: LB) or in combination with enalapril (ENA+LB) for 1 week. Controls received vehicle. After 1 week, ED was completely corrected with LB but not affected significantly by ENA, whereas both treatments failed to induce SMC apoptosis or aortic remodeling. The correction of ED and the induction of SMC apoptosis (3. 3 -fold increase in TUNEL labeling) required 2 weeks of ENA treatment. The combination of LB with ENA for 1 week, however, was additive for the reduction of SMC proliferation, and synergistic for the induction of apoptosis and regression of vascular hypertrophy. These interactions were independent of blood pressure regulation. Our results suggest that the correction of ED is not sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis and vascular remodeling, although it facilitates these responses during enalapril treatment...|$|R

40|$|Elderly {{people are}} {{susceptible}} to both falls and cognitive impairment making them a particularly vulnerable group of patients {{when it comes to}} pain assessment and management in the emergency department (ED). Pain assessment is often difficult in patients who present to the ED with a cognitive impairment as they are frequently unable to self-report their level of pain, which can {{have a negative impact on}} pain management. This paper aims to review how cognitive impairment influences pain assessment in elderly adults who present to the ED with an injury due to a fall. A literature search of EMBASE, ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, SciFinder and the Curtin University Library database was conducted using keyword searches to generate lists of articles which were then screened for relevance by title and then abstract to give a final list of articles for full-text review. Further articles were identified by snowballing from the reference lists of the full-text articles. The literature reports that ED staff commonly use visual or verbal analogue scales to assess pain, but resort to their own intuition or physiological parameters rather than using standardised observational pain assessment tools when self-report of pain is not attainable due to cognitive impairment. While studies have found that the use of pain assessment tools improves the recognition and management of pain, pain scores are often not recorded for elderly patients with a cognitive impairment in the <b>ED,</b> <b>leading</b> to poorer pain management in this patient group in terms of time to analgesic administration and the use of strong opioids.

40|$|International audienceBackground: A long {{completion}} {{time in the}} Emergency Department (ED) is associated with higher morbidity and in-hospital mortality. A {{completion time}} of {{more than four hours}} is a frequently used cutoff point. Mostly, older and sicker patients exceed a completion time of four hours on the ED. The primary aim was to examine which factors currently contribute to overcrowding and a time to completion of more than four hours on the EDs of two different hospitals, namely: the VU Medical Center (VUmc), an academic level 1 trauma centre and the St. Antonius Hospital, a large community hospital in Nieuwegein. In addition, we compared the differences between these hospitals. Methods: In this observational study, the time steps in the process of diagnosing and treatment of all patients visiting the EDs of the two hospitals were measured for four weeks. Patients triaged as Emergency Severity Index (ESI) category 2 / 3 or Manchester Triage System (MTS) orange/yellow were followed more closely and prospectively by researchers for detailed information in the same period from 12. 00 - 23. 00 hrs. Results: In the VUmc, 89 % of the patients had a completion time of less than four hours. The average completion time (n = 2262) was 2 : 10 hours, (median 1 : 51 hours, range: 0 : 05 - 12 : 08). In the St. Antonius Hospital, 77 % of patients had a completion time shorter than four hours (n = 1656). The average completion time in hours was 2 : 49 (n = 1655, median 2 : 34, range: 0 : 08 - 11 : 04). In the VUmc, a larger percentage of ESI 1, 2 and 3 patients did not achieve the 4 -hour target (14 %, 20 % and 19 %) compared with ESI 4 and 5 patients (2. 7 % and 0 %), p < 0. 001. At the St. Antonius Hospital, a greater percentage of orange and yellow categorised patients exceeded four hours on the ED (32 % and 28 %) compared with red (8 %) and green/blue (13 %), p < 0. 001. For both hospitals there was a significant dependency between exceeding four hours on the ED and the following: whether a consultation was performed (p < 0. 001), the number of radiology tests performed (p < 0. 001), and an age above 65 years. Conclusion: Factors <b>leading</b> to <b>ED</b> stagnation were similar in both hospitals, namely old age, treatment by more than one speciality and undergoing radiological tests. Uniform remedial measures should be taken on a nationwide level to deal with these factors to reduce stagnation in the EDs.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute asthma attacks {{remain a}} {{frequent}} cause of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admission. Many factors encourage patients to seek asthma {{treatment at the}} emergency department. These factors {{may be related to}} the patient himself or to a health system that hinders asthma control. The aim of this study was to identify the main factors that lead to the frequent admission of asthmatic patients to the ED. Methods A cross-sectional survey of all the patients who visited the emergency room with bronchial asthma attacks over a 9 -month period was undertaken at two major academic hospitals. The following data were collected: demographic data, asthma control in the preceding month, where and by whom the patients were treated, whether the patient received education about asthma or its medication and the patients’ reasons for visiting the ED. Result Four hundred fifty (N[*]=[*] 450) patients were recruited, 39. 1 % of whom were males with a mean age of 42. 3 [*]±[*] 16. 7. The mean duration of asthma was 155. 90 [*]±[*] 127. 13 weeks. Approximately half of the patients did not receive any information about bronchial asthma as a disease, and 40. 7 % did not receive any education regarding how to use asthma medication. Asthma was not controlled or partially controlled in the majority (97. 7 %) of the patients preceding the admission to ED. The majority of the patients visited the ED to receive a bronchodilator by nebuliser (86. 7 %) and to obtain oxygen (75. 1 %). Moreover, 20. 9 % of the patients believed that the ED managed them faster than the clinic, and 21. 1 % claimed that their symptoms were severe enough that they could not wait for a clinic visit. No education about asthma and uncontrolled asthma are the major factors <b>leading</b> to frequent <b>ED</b> visits (three or more visits/year), p-value[*]=[*] 0. 0145 and p-value[*]=[*] 0. 0003, respectively. Asthma control also exhibited a significant relationship with inhaled corticosteroid ICS use (p-value = 0. 0401) and education about asthma (p-value = 0. 0117).

40|$|Abstract Background Emergency Department (ED) {{crowding}} {{has been}} studied for the last 20 years, yet many questions remain about its impact on patient care. In this study, we aimed to determine if ED crowding influenced patient triage destination and intensity of investigation, as well as rates of unscheduled returns to the ED. We focused on patients presenting with chest pain or shortness of breath, triaged as high acuity, and who were subsequently discharged home. Methods This pilot study was a health records review of 500 patients presenting to two urban tertiary care EDs with chest pain or shortness of breath, triaged as high acuity and subsequently discharged home. Data extracted included triage time, date, treatment area, time to physician initial assessment, investigations ordered, disposition, and return ED visits within 14 days. We defined ED crowding as ED occupancy greater than 1. 5. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the χ 2 and Fisher exact tests. Results Over half of the patients, 260 / 500 (52. 0 %) presented during conditions of ED crowding. More patients were triaged to the non-monitored area of the ED during ED crowding (65 / 260 (25. 0 %) vs. 39 / 240 (16. 3 %) when not crowded, P[*]=[*] 0. 02). During ED crowding, mean time to physician initial assessment was 132. 0 minutes in the non-monitored area vs. 99. 1 minutes in the monitored area, P < 0. 0001. When the ED was not crowded, mean time to physician initial assessment was 122. 3 minutes in the non-monitored area vs. 67 minutes in the monitored area, P[*]=[*] 0. 0003. Patients {{did not return to}} the ED more often when triaged during ED crowding: 24 / 260 (9. 3 %) vs. 29 / 240 (12. 1 %) when ED was not crowded (P[*]=[*] 0. 31). Overall, when triaged to the non-monitored area of the ED, 44 / 396 (11. 1 %) patients returned, whereas in the monitored area 9 / 104 (8. 7 %) patients returned, P[*]=[*] 0. 46.

40|$|Edwards, David G. Patients {{diagnosed}} with {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) {{are more likely to}} die of cardiovascular disease than progress to end stage renal disease. Evidence indicates that increased cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients may be related to compromised vascular integrity and ultimately endothelial dysfunction (<b>ED)</b> <b>leading</b> to poor tissue oxygen perfusion at not only renal but also cardiovascular tissues. Consequentially, progenitor-cell-based therapies have been suggested to preserve vascular continuity and induce vascularization, thereby preventing endothelial cell apoptosis, ED, and ultimately organ failure and cardiovascular events in CKD patients. The purpose of this investigation was to enumerate circulating progenitor cell (CPC) subpopulations of hematopoietic, endothelial, and myeloid lineage in CKD patients and compare them to apparently healthy controls. Additionally, a colony forming unit (CFU) assay was performed and endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD) was assessed using a non-invasive measurement of brachial artery reactivity known as flow-mediated dilation (FMD). We hypothesized that progenitor cell subpopulations would be reduced and CFUs as well as EDD would be impaired in the CKD subjects as compared to the healthy controls. Also, regression analysis was performed looking at the relationships between CPC subpopulations, CFUs, subject characteristics, and EDD measurements. Ten individuals with stages 3 - 5 CKD and ten apparently healthy controls were recruited, blood was drawn and brachial artery FMD was performed. CPCs were then quantified using the cell surface markers CD 34, KDR, and CD 45 with flow cytometry, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the venousblood were cultured for the colony-forming assay. Renal function was significantly lower in the CKD patients as indicated by estimated glomerular filtration rate, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and increased serum creatinine levels. CKD patients also had significantly lower average percent changes in vessel diameter, and the hematopoietic progenitor subpopulations CD 34 +, CD 34 +/KDR+, CD 34 +/CD 45 -, and CD 34 +/KDR+/CD 45 - were reduced in this CKD sample. Furthermore, myeloid precursor populations CD 45 + and CD 45 +/KDR+ were lower and colony forming ability was impaired in CKD patients with differences approaching statistical significance. Regression analysis indicated that the CPC subpopulations CD 34 +, CD 34 +/CD 45 -, and CD 34 +/KDR+/CD 45 -, in addition to EDD, were negatively associated with serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, whereas CD 34 + and CD 34 +/KDR+/CD 45 - CPCs were also significantly positively correlated with percent change in vessel diameter. In conclusion, multiple subset populations of CPCs have been identified, shown to be reduced, and associated with EDD in the CKD population. Reductions in these progenitor cell subpopulations may be a potential mechanism by which vascular integrity is compromised and endothelial dysfunction results, increasing the risk of CVD and contributing to renal disease progression in CKD patients. Therefore, treatment strategies that target these specific subpopulations may be important in optimizing therapeutic effectiveness and ultimately improving renal and cardiovascular outcomes in this disease population.

40|$|Morbidity and {{mortality}} rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are increased among end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients receiving dialysis treatment, and not corrected with kidney transplantation (KTx). Classic CVD risk factors {{do not fully}} predict the increased risk, with novel factors causing endothelial dysfunction (<b>ED),</b> <b>leading</b> to arteriosclerosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) and sudden death, key to disease pathogenesis. These novel factors include bone marrow (BM) derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which have key roles in maintenance, repair and growth of the endothelium. There is limited data {{about the role of}} EPCs and CVD in the ESKD population. This uraemic milieu includes p-cresol (sulfate, PC/S) and indoxyl sulfate (IS), toxins associated with CVD in ESKD. In this thesis, the relationship between CVD and ESKD, and the potential role of EPCs and uraemic toxins was examined from epidemiological, clinical and laboratory perspectives. Data was obtained for the period between 2002 - 2007 for all hospital separations in Australia. Analysis was performed based on ICD- 9 / 10 coding. This showed (for the first time in an Australian population) : (i) an increase in risk for CVD hospital separations among dialysis and KTx, with higher rates for CHF than acute cardiac events (ACE); (ii) an advantage for KTx recipients in regards to ACE, but not CHF hospital separations, over dialysis recipients, and (iii) for CHF, no increase in in-hospital mortality, or length of stay per separation for any ESKD group compared to controls. At a clinical level, in groups of haemodialysis (HDx), KTx patients and controls, low peripheral blood (PB) EPC numbers were correlated with surrogate markers of CVD and ED. No clear relationship of IS and PC/S with ED was seen (although study power was limited). For in vitro studies, techniques were developed for isolation (Flow sort and AutoMACS), enumeration (FACS) and culture expansion of EPCs from BM and umbilical cord blood samples. The effects of uraemic serum and toxins PC and IS on cultured endothelial cells (ECs) and EPCs in vitro was examined, as a model of vascular pathology in ESKD. Greater HUVEC VCAM- 1 expression and reduced tube formation in Matrigel were observed in response to increasing PC concentration than IS. The effect of IS (but not PC) at higher concentration in Matrigel was reduced by the addition of EPCs. Akt/ERK expression by western blot, cell migration to VEGF, and supernatant investigation by FlowCytoMix for soluble cell surface markers, were also performed. Testing of HUVEC function post-exposure to sera from control, transplant and HDx recipients did not replicate the above results on the basis of sera PC and IS levels. In summary, this thesis has explored the increased burden of CVD in ESKD patients in Australia, the relationship of EPCs, both in vivo and in vitro, to vascular disease in this setting, and the role of uraemic toxins as agents for CVD. These results underline why certain therapies may not be effective in the ESKD population for CVD prevention, and suggest novel approaches are needed. Thesis (Ph. D.)
