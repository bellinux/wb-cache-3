5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> each other's face. If two individuals are simply <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E
