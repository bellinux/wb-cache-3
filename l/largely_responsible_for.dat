5|$|Nodes were {{designated}} 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending upon {{how long they}} were expected to hold out. Home Guard troops were <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the defence of nodal points and other centres of resistance such as towns and defended villages. Category 'A' nodal points and anti-tank islands usually had a garrison of regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Owen's {{argument}} that the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it. In more recent decades, however, such a view has come to be widely accepted, {{due in large part to}} the influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice and Slattery were {{praised by}} Guthrie in 1964, when the airline {{reported}} a {{profit for the}} 1963–1964 financial year, commenting that {{he was unable to}} take credit for the performance and this his predecessors were <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the improved financial performance of the airline.|$|E
50|$|On 9 and 16 March 2017, Leali was the {{starting}} goalkeeper in both UEFA Europa League last 16 legs against Besiktas, but was <b>largely</b> held <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> his team's elimination due {{to at least}} three serious goalkeeping errors, one in the home game and two on the road; the respective matches ended 1-1 and 4-1 to the Turkish side.|$|R
5000|$|The later Greek {{historian}} Diogenes Laërtius dubiously {{reported that}} after the execution of Socrates [...] "Athenians felt such remorse" [...] that they executed Meletus and banished his associates from the city. He also argues that it was Antisthenes, the disciple of Socrates and founder of Cynicism, whom was <b>largely</b> thought <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the execution of Meletus.|$|R

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> his casting. In {{the years}} leading up the {{production}} of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and wanted him to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} fish species diversity in Lake Victoria has {{been attributed to}} predation by Nile perch, Lates niloticus Linne, without sufficient justification. Exploitation, interspecific competition and hybridization had profound impact on the decline of the indigenous commercial fish species. The roles of exploitation, competition and hybridization, and of predation by the Nile perch on changes in species diversity have been discussed. Lates was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> only <b>for</b> the decline of the haplochromine stocks...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} day, as reinforcements {{arrived at}} the dock by sea, 2 RAR was relieved by 3 RAR, {{who took over the}} task of guarding the docks, freeing up 2 RAR to continue further operations around Dili.

5|$|Development of the LS {{began in}} 1983 as the F1 project, the code {{name for a}} secret {{flagship}} sedan. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process {{at a cost of}} over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the successful launch of the Lexus marque.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House.

50|$|In 1982, Peter Villa led a {{management}} buyout of Air UK's charter business, resulting in reconstituting BIA as a charter-only airline and his departure from Air UK {{along with the}} four BAC One-Eleven 400s. In addition to the tough economic climate and merger blues during the airline's inception {{as a result of}} combining two organisations with vastly different cultures and management styles, the operation of these aircraft had <b>largely</b> been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> Air UK's poor financial performance that threatened the airline's survival.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his role on the councils, Laybourne Smith was an adviser during {{the development of the}} State Building Act of 1923, and he was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the framing of the 1939 Architects Act, (which provided for the formal registration of architects in South Australia). Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The Amarillo Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) {{is funded}} by a city sales tax, and it {{provides}} aggressive incentive packages to existing and prospective employers.

5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{the production of the}} highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E
5|$|Airbus {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding with Drukair in July 2003 for two 114-seat Airbus A319-115, powered by two CFM56-5B engines, for delivery {{in the second half}} of 2004. The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a {{relatively}} late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team {{until his retirement in}} 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible for the West Indies winning matches which seemed lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was <b>largely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).|$|E
2500|$|The {{domestic}} dog has <b>largely</b> been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> introducing {{canine distemper}} to previously unexposed wildlife and now causes a serious conservation threat to {{many species of}} carnivores and some species of marsupials.

In 1991, the lion population in Serengeti, Tanzania, experienced a 20% decline {{as a result of the}} disease. [...] The disease has also mutated to form phocid distemper virus, which affects seals.|$|R
5000|$|Friends of Science (FoS) is a Canadian {{non-profit}} {{advocacy organization}} based in Calgary, Alberta. The organization takes a position that humans are <b>largely</b> not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the currently observed global warming, contrary to the established scientific position on the subject. Rather, they propose that [...] "the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change," [...] not human activity. They argued against the Kyoto Protocol.
