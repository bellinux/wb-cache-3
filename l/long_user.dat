40|$|We apply {{recurrent}} {{neural networks}} (RNN) {{on a new}} domain, namely recommender systems. Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e. g. a small sportsware website) instead of <b>long</b> <b>user</b> histories (as {{in the case of}} Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i. e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches. Comment: Camera ready version (17 th February, 2016) Affiliation update (29 th March, 2016...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Intelligent environments {{allow for}} {{creating}} dense records of user actions, {{which can be}} exploited for immediate user support {{as well as for}} creating user models, which adapt over time to user behavior. In this article, previous work concerning the building, exploitation, and sharing of a so-called personal digital memory, which was conducted in the projects SPECTER and SharedLife, issummarizedwithaspecial focus on its potential for life <b>long</b> <b>user</b> modeling. Nowadays, the building of user models from perceptions made by an intelligent environment is a common practice. Such models may be exploited for a broad range of applications, such as personalization or decision support. The recording of the underlying perceptions and their interpretations has various benefits: in addition to direct user support on the basis of past actions, such “digital memories ” enable a system to learn the user’s habits.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a myriad of mobile apps which collect {{personally}} identifiable information (PII) and a prospective market place of personal data, we investigate a user-centric monetary valuation of mobile PII. During a 6 -week <b>long</b> <b>user</b> study in a living lab deployment with 60 participants, we collected their daily valuations of 4 categories of mobile PII (communication, e. g. phonecalls made/received, applications, e. g. time spent on different apps, location and media, photos taken) at three levels of complexity (individual data points, aggregated statistics and processed, i. e. meaningful interpretations of the data). In order to obtain honest valuations, we employ a reverse second price auction mechanism. Our findings show that the most sensitive and valued category of personal information is location. We report statistically significant associations between actual mobile usage, personal dispositions, and bidding behavior. Finally, we outline key implications for the design of mobile services and future markets of personal data. Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|People {{often make}} terrible {{mistakes}} when addressing email messages. One type of costly mistake is an email leak, i. e., accidentally {{sending a message}} to an unintended recipient — a widespread problem that can severely harm individuals and corporations. An-other type of addressing error is forgetting to add an intended collaborator as recipient, a likely source of costly misunderstandings and communication delays. Several methods to address these problems have been recently proposed in the literature [2, 3]. In this pa-per we describe the implementation of some of these methods in a popular email client (Mozilla Thunder-bird), and conduct a 4 -week <b>long</b> <b>user</b> study based on this implementation. Results showed that more than 15 % of the human subjects reported that the client prevented real cases of email leaks, and more than 47 % of them utilized the provided recipient recommenda-tions. Overall the study shows that methods to prevent email addressing mistakes can be valuable additions to email communication, with more than 80 % of the subjects reporting that they would permanently use these methods if a few interface/optimization changes were included in our Thunderbird implementation...|$|E

Although the radiation emitted by hand phones are essentially small, but capable of <b>long</b> <b>user</b> interactions potentially cause health problems or even damage to the tissue and cells. This study was conducted to determine the effect of duration of exposure and the distance of sources of hand phone radiation to the protein content of beef. Beef samples irradiated with long exposure variation 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 minutes, and the variation of the radiation source spacing 1. 5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm to the object. Then the sample was measured a protein content of beef by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The results showed a decrease in the percentage of protein content of beef irradiated from normal state with increasing duration of exposure, and otherwise the percentage of protein content of beef with increasing distance of the radiation source. This occurs because intensity of radiation received increase with increasing of radiation exposure and decreasing of distance of the radiation source. The effect of duration of exposure and the distance of the radiation source to the protein content of beef as evidenced with decreasing the percentage of protein content occurred at the long exposure time of 90 minutes and the distance of the radiation source from material is 1, 5 cm...|$|E
40|$|The rise of {{the mobile}} Internet enables the {{creation}} of applications that provide new and easier ways for people to organise themselves, raise issues, take action and interact with their city. However, a lack of motivation or knowledge often prevents many citizens from regularly contributing to the common good. Therefore, this thesis presents DoGood, a smartphone app, that aims at motivating citizens to carry out civic activities. The thesis asks what kinds of activities citizens consider to be civic {{and to what extent}} gamification can motivate users in this context. The DoGood app uses gamified elements to encourage citizens to submit and promote their civic activities as well as to join the activities of others. Gamification is sometimes criticized for simply adding a limited number of game elements, such as leaderboards, on top of an existing experience. However, {{in the case of the}} DoGood app, the process of game design was an integral part of the development, and the gamified elements target the user’s intrinsic motivations instead of providing them with an external reward. DoGood was implemented as hybrid mobile app and deployed to citizens of Brisbane in a five weeks <b>long</b> <b>user</b> study. The app successfully motivated most of its users to do more civic activities and its gamified elements were well received. Based on the results of the user study, civic activities can be defined as activities that give citizens the opportunity to become involved and improve life in their local community...|$|E
40|$|While mobile {{advertisement}} is {{the dominant}} source of revenue for mobile apps, the usage patterns of mobile users, and thus their engagement and exposure times, may be {{in conflict with the}} effectiveness of current ads. User engagement with apps can range from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on a number of factors such as users ’ locations, concurrent activities and goals. Despite the wide-range of engagement times, the current format of ad auctions dictates that ads are priced, sold and configured prior to actual viewing, regardless of the actual ad exposure time. We argue that the wealth of easy-to-gather contextual informa-tion on mobile devices is sufficient to allow advertisers to make better choices by effectively predicting exposure time. We analyze mobile device usage patterns with a detailed two-week <b>long</b> <b>user</b> study of 37 users in the US and South Korea. After characterizing application session times, we use factor analysis to derive a simple predictive model and show it is able to offer improved accuracy compared to mean session time over 90 % of the time. We make the case for including predicted ad exposure duration in the price of mobile advertisements and posit that such information could significantly impact the effectiveness of mobile ads by giving publishers the ability to tune campaigns for engagement length, and enable a more efficient market for ad impressions while lowering network utilization and device power consumption...|$|E

40|$|Special collections, {{because of}} the issues {{associated}} with conservation and use, a feature they share with archives, {{tend to be the}} most digitized areas in libraries. The Nineteenth Century Schoolbooks collection is a collection of 9000 rarely held nineteenth-century schoolbooks that were painstakingly collected over a lifetime of work by Prof. John A. Nietz, and donated to the Hillman Library at the University of Pittsburgh in 1958, which has since grown to 15, 000. About 140 of these texts are completely digitized and showcased in a publicly accessible website through the University of Pittsburgh’s Library, along with a searchable bibliography of the entire collection, which expanded the awareness of this collection and its user base to beyond the academic community. The URL for the website is [URL] The collection is a rich resource for researchers studying the intellectual, educational, and textbook publishing history of the United States. In this study, we examined several existing records collected by the Digital Research Library at the University of Pittsburgh {{in order to determine the}} identity and searching behaviors of the users of this collection. Some of the records examined include: 1) The results of a 3 -month <b>long</b> <b>user</b> survey, 2) User access statistics including search queries for a period of one year, a year after the digitized collection became publicly available in 2001, and 3) E-mail input received by the website over 4 years from 2000 - 2004. The results of the study demonstrate the differences in online retrieval strategies used by academic researchers and historians, archivists, avocationists, and the general public, and the importance of facilitating the discovery of digitized special collections through the use of electronic finding aids and an interactive interface with detailed metadata. ...|$|E
40|$|In Finland, tax payers’ {{money is}} used by public sector {{organizations}} to implement open source digital services to solve problem situations raised by common citizens. However, traditional long development cycle often results with solutions that don’t address intended users’ needs. To remedy this, Digipalvelutehdas community introduced a process that would require a 3 -month long development phase to produce a testable proof of concept for any digital service. To permit further implementation, the development progress needed to be closely monitored. Digipalvelutehdas brought {{up the idea of}} Dipor Dashboard for monitoring service development and Sampo Software Oy was assigned to develop a testable interface. The thesis work focused on defining requirements for this dashboard out of needs from its intended users and proposed a concept using low fidelity design sketches. The goal was to determine how attributes from GitHub repositories could be visualized in a Dashboard view to project development progress. The usability and feasibility of the system developed by Sampo Software was also evaluated. User experience study of the system had been done in a limited scope. The thesis report begins with background work. A competitor analysis for existing market solutions is then provided. A discussion is made on existing work over Dashboard design, Agile development visualization and using GitHub attributes to build Agile workflows. First phase of empirical work involved interviewing the customer and intended users to develop concept for the dashboard using iterative design and evaluation of low fidelity prototypes. Usability evaluation of the implemented system was done in second phase with two heuristic evaluations and five usability tests. A four week <b>long</b> <b>user</b> study was initiated with two participants in the third phase, which was continued for two weeks due to unavoidable circumstances. The implemented Dipor Dashboard focused more on organization hierarchy than on Digital services. The supposed dashboard view {{turned out to be an}} integration view for comparing different repository works intended for the same service. Used charts had issues in look & feel, functionality and data representation. Development progress wasn’t visualized following Agile methodology. Major design and functionality rework would be needed to make the system more usable. Although being a better option, the developed concept needs more research on appropriate visualizations and common data framework to integrate systems other than GitHub repositories...|$|E

It may also be accessed via Westlaw UK ([URL] with a valid subscription. The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Lawrence v Fen Tigers 1 is significant, not least {{for the fact that}} it is one of few recent decisions of the highest court in relation to the tort of nuisance. In addition to giving general guidance on the relationship between nuisance and planning and with regards to the appropriate remedy in nuisance cases, it discusses the potential for an easement to make noise. In many respects the decision can be said to be helpful and welcome. The clarification of the role of planning permission within nuisance actions is extremely useful. There are some questions raised by the decision however, and the indication that the judges would be willing to see a greater role for damages within nuisance is both significant, and from a property law perspective at least, potentially problematic. What the decision does not tell us however, despite the clear acknowledgment from the judiciary that the appeal raised the issue, is what the role of nuisance is and ought to be in an era of heavy regulatory control on the use of land. Facts The claimant's house, in a rural location in Suffolk, was within approximately half a mile of a stadium at which there were regular motor races. The levels of noise emitted during the races were high - and the claimants brought an action in nuisance against the defendants. The defendants argued that the planning permission which they had been granted permitting such racing prevented a successful nuisance claim, as well as arguing that the longevity of their actions prevented C from bringing a claim at this point (either due to the acquisition of an easement by prescription, or because <b>long</b> <b>user</b> meant that the race track now formed part of the character of the locality). Decision The decision of the court can be divided into three key sections, albeit that not all members of the court agree on all issues. Firstly, the court was required to decide whether the claimants had acquired an easement to make noise. Secondly, the court was then required to assess whether, if no such easement had been acquired, the actions of the defendants constituted a nuisance to which they had no relevant defence. In order to answer this question the court needed to assess whether it could be argued that either the claimants having â come toâ the nuisance, or the existence of planning permission in favour of the speedway track, could prevent a successful action in nuisance. Finally, if the court concluded both that there was no easement, and that there was a good claim in nuisance, they had to decide the appropriate remedy to grant. Non...|$|E
