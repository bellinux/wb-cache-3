40|$|This crossover, {{double-blind}} {{study investigated the}} effects of single oral doses of the prodrug <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide,</b> which is reduced gradually to loperamide in the intestine, and loperamide on jejunal motor activity in 12 fasting healthy men. Five minutes after a phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC), 2 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide,</b> 4 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide,</b> 4 mg loperamide, or placebo were administered. Thereafter, motor activity 10 - 30 cm abroad the ligament of Treitz was recorded with five catheter orifices at 3 -cm intervals over 4 hr. Number of contractions and area under curve increased significantly with 4 mg loperamide and 4 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide,</b> the increases with <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> occurring more gradually. Placebo and 2 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> had no discernible effects. With both 4 mg loperamide and 4 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide,</b> phase I of the MMC was slightly prolonged and phase II and the time from drug administration to {{the onset of the}} first phase III slightly shortened. The percentage of aborally propagated contractions in phase II increased with all active treatments, whereas the occurrence of phases III was not altered...|$|E
40|$|<b>Loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> was {{compared}} with placebo {{for the treatment}} of chronic diarrhoea in patients with Crohn's disease. After initially receiving 2 mg <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> or placebo, hospital out-patients with Crohn's disease were instructed to take one tablet of <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> (1 mg) or placebo after passage of each unformed stool in a I-week double-blind investigation. Patients who responded to this treatment by passing less than three unformed stools per 24 h continued to receive the drug, twice daily, for a further week. At the end of the initial I-week treatment phase both the investigator's and the patients ' global evaluations of efficacy were significantly in favour of the active treatment (P = 0. 025 and P = 0. 020, respectively). The investigator's assessment ofthe change in abdominal pain was significant for <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> (P = 0. 020) but not for placebo. Improvements in patient-rated severity of diarrhoea were significantly greater for <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> than for placebo (P = 0. 046). The mean daily dose of <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> was 2. 7 mg. During the second week, both the investigator's and the patients ' assessments of global efficacy and symptom improvement continued to favour <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> though the differences were not significant. Adverse events were rare. The results suggest that <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> (3 mg/per day) provides a safe and effective treatment for the chronic diarrhoea associated with Crohn's disease...|$|E
40|$|<b>Loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> is a prodrug of the {{effective}} antidiarrheal loperamide. Administration of this prodrug improves efficacy and tolerability. For {{better understanding of}} these effects, the absorption and gastrointestinal distribution of <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> and of its active drug loperamide were studied. Beagle dogs received a single oral dose of <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> or loperamide at 0. 16 mg/kg. Plasma, gastrointestinal contents and tissues, and some other organs were obtained. Concentrations were determined by specific radioimmunoassays. <b>Loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> was gradually converted to loperamide in the gastrointestinal tract. After administration of the prodrug, the systemic absorption of the active drug was lower and more delayed than after administration of loperamide itself. As a consequence, more loperamide was available in the contents and the mucosa of the gut, in particular in {{the lower part of}} the small intestine and in the large intestine. The higher revels of loperamide in mucosa may cause more pronounced and longer lasting antisecretory effects after administration of <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide.</b> The results of this study are in line with the hypothesis that <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> is a site-specific prodrug that acts as a chemically designed controlled-release form of loperamide keeping a higher amount of the active drug for a longer time at the site of action in the gut wall. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Loperamide {{improves}} anorectal {{function in}} patients with chronic diarrhoea. We wished to investigate whether the prodrug <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> has similar effects. Methods: Eleven patients with chronic diarrhoea and faecal incontinence participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study {{of the effects of}} <b>loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> (4 mg twice daily for 1 week). Results: <b>Loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> reduced wet stool weight and improved the patients' ratings of symptoms. Mouth-to-caecum transit time was not altered, but whole-gut transit time was prolonged. There were limited effects on anorectal function, but the mean minimum basal pressure mainly contributed by the internal anal sphincter (IAS) was increased, as was the mean volume infused before leakage occurred in the saline continence test. Conclusion: <b>Loperamide</b> <b>oxide</b> is effective in the treatment of diarrhoea with faecal incontinence; normalization of colon transit time and an increase in the tone of the IAS seem to be the main determinants of efficacy.
