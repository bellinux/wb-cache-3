25|$|For various {{geologic}} reasons, modelled differently {{by different}} geologists, {{the zone of}} compression in the Aegean became one of extension: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by isostasy. In {{the case of the}} Menderes Massif, which is , the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults.

25|$|Larbert {{railway station}} opened on 22 May 1848, when the Scottish Central Railway built its {{line through the}} village and {{narrowly}} survived the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. Larbert station lies north {{of one of the}} major rail junctions in central Scotland, where the line from Stirling and Perth splits into one branch heading to Glasgow and the other to Edinburgh. The station is on the Edinburgh to Dunblane and Croy <b>Lines.</b> <b>Like</b> most stations in Scotland, Larbert, which has two platforms, is owned by Network Rail and operated by Abellio ScotRail on their behalf. During the day, trains are half-hourly to Glasgow and Edinburgh and take 35minutes and 45minutes respectively to reach their destinations. There are four trains per hour to Stirling, which is a journey of 10minutes. In 200506 there were 468,849 passenger journeys from the station, a rise of 9.6percent on the previous year.|$|E
25|$|From the 18th century, {{the most}} popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were ballad operas, like John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, that {{included}} lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later pantomime, which developed from commedia dell'arte, and comic opera with mostly romantic plot <b>lines,</b> <b>like</b> Michael Balfe's The Bohemian Girl (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, singspiel, comédie en vaudeville, opéra comique, zarzuela {{and other forms of}} light musical entertainment were emerging. The Beggar's Opera was the first recorded long-running play of any kind, running for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century afterwards before any play broke 100 performances, but the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s. Other musical theatre forms developed in England by the 19th century, such as music hall, melodrama and burletta, which were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music.|$|E
25|$|The 32nd Infantry Division was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army National Guard that fought primarily during World War I and World War II.

The division was briefly called up during the Berlin Crisis in 1961. In 1967, the division was deactivated and reconstituted the 32nd Infantry Brigade of the Wisconsin Army National Guard only to be reorganized in 2007 as the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The shoulder sleeve insignia currently worn is a red line shot through with a red arrow, giving them the nickname Red Arrow Brigade, which was earned in World War I where the 32nd Division was fighting the Germans alongside the French, who noted the unit's tenacity by punching through the German <b>lines,</b> <b>like</b> an arrow and calling the unit Les Terribles, meaning The Terrors.|$|E
