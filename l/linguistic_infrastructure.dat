40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 522 foreign {{affiliates}} of Turkish multinational enterprises (MNEs) with varying levels of Turkish equity ownership, this study provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of equity-based entry mode strategies in host country markets. A number of hypotheses are developed to {{examine the impact of}} institutional, transaction specific and firm level variables on Turkish MNEs' choice of equity ownership mode in their foreign affiliates. The results reveal that institutional variables are important in explaining the equity composition of foreign affiliates of Turkish MNEs. Particularly important in determining equity ownership mode were found to be political constraints, <b>linguistic</b> distance, knowledge <b>infrastructure</b> and the extent of parent diversity. Results concerning the influences {{of the size of the}} affiliate are contrary to expectations and contradict the findings of previous research. No support was found for the impact of cultural distance on the equity ownership mode of Turkish MNEs in their foreign affiliates. Apart from political constraints, equity ownership choice and its underlying determinants do not vary between emerging and developed host country markets.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the number and depth of analyses required over the text, like entity recognition, POS tagging, syntactic analysis, etc. the annotation in-line has become unpractical. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) some emphasis has been placed in finding an annotation method to solve this problem. A possibility is the standoff annotation. With this annotation style it is possible to add new levels of annotation without disturbing exiting ones, with minimal knock on effects. This annotation will increase the possibility of adding more linguistic information as well as more possibilities for sharing textual resources. In this paper we present a tool developed in the framework of the European Metanet 4 u 1 (Enhancing the European <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Infrastructure,</b> GA 270893) for creating a multi-layered XML annotation scheme, based on the GrAF proposal for standoff annotations...|$|E

Although primarily intended for <b>linguistic</b> research, this <b>infrastructure</b> provides rich resources for courses on sociolinguistics, dialectology, formal linguistics and linguistic methodology. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the Dutch linguistic microvariation research tool MIMORE (www. meertens. knaw. nl/mimore) for a course in applied linguistics, more specifically on Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin (LADO). LADO is used in asylum procedures as a means to determine whether an asylum seeker originates from the country or area that s/he claims to originate from. It is a task of linguists to make clear if and how LADO can be a valid method, and what kind of linguistic expertise is needed. MIMORE contains three databases with (morpho-) syntactic and (morpho‐) phonological data from a large number of locations in the Dutch language area. The paper describes how the MIMORE data and tools have been used in the course as training material, to introduce students to the different levels of language variation, to teach them how to recognize linguistic differences and make these explicit and to show them the complications involved in using linguistic properties to locate speakers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} compares {{several of}} the thematic roles of VerbNet (VN) {{to those of the}} <b>Linguistic</b> <b>InfRastructure</b> for Interoperable ResourCes and Systems (LIRICS). The purpose of this comparison is to develop a standard set of thematic roles that would be suited to a variety of natural language processing (NLP) applications. We draw from both resources to construct a unified set of semantic roles that will replace existing VN semantic roles. Through the process of comparison, we find that a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained, intermediate and fine-grained roles facilitates mapping between semantic resources of differing granularity and allows for flexibility in how VN can be used for diverse NLP applications; thus, we propose a hierarchical taxonomy of the unified roleset. The comparison and subsequent development of the hierarchy reveals a level of granularity shared by both resources, which could be further developed into a standard set of thematic roles for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

In this paper, we describe {{the achievement of the}} development and the use of Thai Language Resources germinated with an open collaboration platform, under the collaboration between research institutes. The resources include either text or speech. Text resources are divided into lexicon database and annotated corpus. We started developing a corpus-based Thai-English lexicon database (LEXiTRON) since 1994. It was originated from a dictionary designed for using in developing a machine translation system. Since then the Thai POS was designed and evaluated in several applications (word segmentation, machine translation, grapheme-to-phoneme, etc.) Extending the lexicon database, POS tagged corpus (ORCHID), and speech corpora for both synthesis and recognition are developed and functioned as an important part of research and development on NLP or HLT. These language resources are available for academic experiment. 1...|$|E

For several years the Penn Treebank initiatives have served as a de facto standard, but more recent work (e. g. the Negra/Tiger initiatives 1 in Germany or the ISST initiative in Italy 2) has shown that a more coherent framework could be designed to account for both (hierarchical) constituency and dependency phenomena in syntactic annotation.

40|$|Democratic theory presupposes open {{channels}} of dialogue, but focuses {{almost exclusively on}} matters of institutional design writ large. The philosophy of language explicates <b>linguistic</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> but often avoids exploring the political significance of its findings. In this Article, Professor Tsai draws from the two disciplines to reach new insights about the democracy-enhancing qualities of popular constitutional language. Employing examples from the founding era, the struggle for black civil rights, the religious awakening {{of the last two}} decades, and the search for gay equality, he presents a model of constitutional dialogue that emphasizes common modalities and mobilized vernacular. According to this model, metaphors, metonyms, and other idioms serve as integral features of democratic institution-building. An especially resonant metaphor spreads democratic ideology efficiently and aggressively. The composition helps to create the appearance of political rule as continuous and timeless. It also renders law accountable to the people – by reestablishing the terms of community through this language device in the course of litigation and public debate, ordinary citizens can redirect the very path of higher law. In short, popular language legitimates constitutional regimes and builds support among the people themselves...|$|E
40|$|This paper starts by {{discussing}} {{research into the}} effect of background knowledge on English for Academic Purposes (EAP) tests and discusses EAP tests in which the content of {{at least some of}} the test components is related to students’ fields of academic study. This section shows how research has demonstrated that students do not necessarily do better if they are given tests in their own academic subject areas and how, because of the difficulties inherent in test-equating, such tests may not be testing the students fairly. The paper suggests, therefore, that for international EAP tests, English for Specific Academic Purposes testing be abandoned. In its second part, the paper discusses what EAP tests might consist of in the future. Instead of EAP proficiency tests, the paper suggests that there should be aptitude tests to find out whether L 1 and L 2 students would be capable of rapidly acquiring the requisite academic discourse practices once they had embarked on their academic courses. Such tests for L 2 students should include a test of specific grammatical skills, so that receiving institutions can be sure that students have the requisite <b>linguistic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> needed to carry out academic work in English...|$|E

Corpora are assem-bled using a standard, thanks to the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) format. This implies extending, through a European endeavor, the TEI model of text, in order to encompass the richest and the more complex CMC genres. This paper presents the Interaction Space model. We explain how this model has been encoded within the TEI corpus header and body. The model is then instantiated through the first four corpora we have processed: three corpora where interactions occurred in single-modality environments (text chat, or SMS systems) and a fourth corpus where text chat, email and forum modalities were used simultaneously. The CoMeRe project has two main research perspectives: Discourse Analysis, only alluded to in this paper, and the linguistic study of idiolects occurring in different CMC genres. As NLP algorithms are an indispensable prerequisite for such research, we present our motiva-tions for applying an automatic annotation process to the CoMeRe corpora. Our wish to guarantee generic annotations meant we did not consider any processing beyond morphosyn-tactic labelling, but prioritized the automatic annotation of any freely variant elements within the corpora. We then turn to decisions made concerning which annotations to make for which units and describe the processing pipeline for adding these. All CoMeRe corpora are verified, thanks to a staged quality control process, designed to allow corpora {{to move from one}} project phase to the next. Public release of the CoMeRe corpora is a short-term goal: corpora will be integrated into the forthcoming French National Reference Corpus, and disseminated through the national <b>linguistic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> ORTOLANG. We, therefore, highlight issues and decisions made concerning the OpenData perspective...|$|E
40|$|How does {{language}} mediate action, {{communication and}} relations in legal settings not 2 ̆ 2 contaminated 2 ̆ 2 by {{the mediation of}} professional counsel? What is its interaction with, {{and what does it}} do to the concerns that drove litigants to seek institutional justice in the first place (or are cast into defensive roles?) How to approach these question in the context of communities diversified by ethnicity, gender, language, religion, education, income, age — whose members nevertheless meet in the same courtroom, where they must speak to authority as well as {{to each other in the}} role of institutional antagonists?This paper, presenting empirical and interpretative work, analyzes legal language through the rhetorical, argumentative and narrative structures employed by self-represented litigants, whose linguistic interaction with the court is not mediated by professional counsel. It identifies two levels of linguistic diversity: the polyphony of competing argumentative strategies expressed by antagonistic litigants in multicultural settings, and the 2 ̆ 2 internal 2 ̆ 2 polyphony, or 2 ̆ 2 monopolyphony, 2 ̆ 2 expressed by 2 ̆ 2 relational 2 ̆ 2 litigants who negotiate and shift between such strategies in real time. This <b>linguistic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> frames the two distinct concerns that lay litigants express when approaching justice: rhetorical effectiveness in terms of persuading the court of their case, and authentic expression of their justice-related concerns, moral standing and other social parameters. Existing research correlates these concerns, roughly, with rule-oriented and relational linguistic approaches, and acknowledges tradeoffs that lay litigants make between them. In this research, however, litigants were observed to resist such tradeoffs, requiring their relational concerns to count as rhetorically compelling; indeed, this was their main requirement from the court. This essential tension of linguistic performance, between authentic expression and institutional efficacy, in fact becomes a definition of justice. As the standard rule-orientated bias of courts is generally not equipped to accept such linguistic strategies, the tension remains unresolved, although it is at times mitigated by effective monopolyphonic performances. Data for this study was collected in six different small claims courts in Israel 2 ̆ 7 s ethnically and culturally diverse northwestern region. The study focuses on overlapping ethnic, gender, age and cultural parameters rather than on social stratification and economic status emphasized by previous research...|$|E
