5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly <b>less</b> <b>from</b> exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of {{the contours of the}} waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{also began}} {{teaching}} and lecturing {{at a number}} of universities in the U.S. and Europe, accepting one-year contracts or <b>less.</b> <b>From</b> 1981 to 1982, McGovern replaced historian Stephen Ambrose as a professor at the University of New Orleans. McGovern also began making frequent speeches, earning several hundred thousand dollars a year.|$|E
5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer <b>less</b> <b>from</b> induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E

50|$|Goeze became {{well known}} chiefly for his debate with Gotthold Ephraim <b>Lessing</b> <b>from</b> 1777-1781. Goeze {{urged him to}} repentance, but little {{came out of the}} debate. Lessing responded with a number of rather polemical texts, finally {{resulting}} in <b>Lessing</b> being prohibited <b>from</b> writing on religious matters. Privately, Lessing showed respect for Goeze by always making sure to visit him when he came to Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|The pulpit is in {{the center}} of the {{building}} which was crafted out of marble by sculptor Otto <b>Lessing</b> <b>from</b> Dresden in 1910. It was designed to look like a rounded chalice and features a magnificent staircase. The large pulpit roof is crowned by the Angel of Annunciation.|$|R
5|$|There were 21deaths in New England, {{including}} eight drownings in Maine. Throughout the United States, {{damage was}} estimated at $42,815,000. Damage was <b>less</b> <b>from</b> Edna than from Carol, primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring {{at the time of}} highest tides, and its track farther to the east. Throughout New England, 260,000people lost power, most of whom in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, the flame robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or <b>less</b> <b>from</b> the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings alternately when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much <b>less</b> <b>from</b> 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E

5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or <b>less</b> <b>from</b> the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, the {{population}} has increased considerably, with {{the population}} of West Mersea rising from 3,140 in 1961 to 6,925 in 2001. Mersea Island has suffered <b>less</b> <b>from</b> the increased popularity of holidaying abroad when compared to nearby resorts such as Clacton and Southend, predominantly due to its isolated and rural atmosphere, and the continued popularity of sailing. In 2006, {{more than a thousand}} locals signed a petition against the proposed opening of a Tesco Express store on the island, expressing concern that it would take trade away from local businesses. Planning permission was granted the following year.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer <b>less</b> <b>from</b> slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae {{was first}} {{collected}} in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 {{as a full}} species of Oryzomys. It was retained as a distinct species related to O.couesi and O.palustris until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz swept it, and other outlying populations {{of the same species}} group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of O.palustris. Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition (1981) of Mammals of North America, arguing that O.peninsulae differed <b>less</b> <b>from</b> mainland Oryzomys populations (currently classified as O.couesi mexicanus) than some other forms he included in O.palustris differed from each other. After studies of the contact zone between North American O.palustris and Central American O.couesi in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) made clear that the two are distinct from each other, O.peninsulae remained as a subspecies of O.couesi. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican Oryzomys and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct Oryzomys species in the region. O.peninsulae and another isolated population, O.nelsoni from the Islas Marías, were both retained as separate species, as was O.albiventer from montane mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, O.couesi mexicanus, of Oryzomys couesi.|$|E
