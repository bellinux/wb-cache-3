40|$|The {{constitution}} {{establishes the}} principle of legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia, which was proclaimed independent on 24 February 1918, occupied by the Soviet Union on 17 June 1940 and subsequently annexed thereto on 6 August 1940. The constitution reflects the idea of legal restoration, which served {{as a basis for}} the return to independence and liberation from the Soviet Union on 21 August 1991. The Riigikogu has recently begun to consider the results of a review carried out by the government expert committee on constitutional revision. The committee’s proposals, if adopted, would not alter the basic principles of the constitution but would reinforce the parliamentary and constitutional system of government. The most important proposals are the establishment of a separate constitutional court, reinforcement of civil control over the defence forces, and attribution of the powers of an ombudsman to the <b>legal</b> <b>chancellor.</b> Moreover, amendments may have to be made in view of the accession of Estonia to the European Union; these amendments touch upon a basic principle of the constitution, {{the principle of}} sovereignty. ...|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, {{assessments}} of Suleiman's reign have frequently {{fallen into the}} trap of the Great Man theory of history. The administrative, cultural, and military achievements of the age were a product not of Suleiman alone, but also of the many talented figures who served him, such as grand viziers Ibrahim Pasha and Rüstem Pasha, the Grand Mufti Ebussuud Efendi, who {{played a major role in}} <b>legal</b> reform, and <b>chancellor</b> and chronicler Celalzade Mustafa, who played a major role in bureaucratic expansion and in constructing Suleiman's legacy.|$|R
5000|$|The Whig Party, on {{the other}} hand, was much more disapproving of the decision. Members of the party felt that the Massachusetts {{legislature}} had violated its contract, {{and that it was}} the federal government’s responsibility to fix the state’s mistake. The federal government’s failure to do so led the Whigs to believe that the power of the federal government was in decline. The Whigs, who were largely businessmen, also feared that corporate property now had no <b>legal</b> protection. <b>Chancellor</b> James Kent wrote in the Whig magazine, The New York Review, [...] "A gathering gloom is cast over the future. We seem to have sunk suddenly below the horizon, to have lost the light of the sun." [...] (2 New York Review 372, 385 (1838)) Many prominent men, including Daniel Webster and Chancellor Kent, a well-known jurist, expressed their disappointment in the Supreme Court for allegedly violating the Constitution. Kent wrote, in a letter to Justice Story, [...] "The court has fallen from its high station and commanding dignity, and has lost its energy, and spirit of independence, and accuracy, and surrendered up to the spirit of the day, the true principles of the Constitution." ...|$|R
