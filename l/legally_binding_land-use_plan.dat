The plan not only covered {{the area around the}} cities of Berlin and Charlottenburg, it also described the spatial regional planning of a large perimeter. Thus it also prepared the city and its neighbouring municipalities for the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, which greatly extended Berlin's size and population.|$|R
5000|$|Third step: Flood Risk Management Plans:Flood Risk Management Plans {{are meant}} to {{indicate}} to policy makers, developers, and the public {{the nature of the}} risk and the measures proposed to manage these risks. However, they are not formally <b>binding</b> (e.g. to <b>land-use</b> <b>planning).</b> The Flood Risk Management Plans [...] are to be complete by December 2015. The Floods Directive prescribes an active involvement of all interested stakeholders in the process. The management plans are to focus on prevention, protection and preparedness. Also, flood risk management plans shall take into account the relevant environmental objectives of Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC, commonly known as the 'Water Framework Directive'.|$|R
40|$|In the Dutch system, {{only the}} local <b>land-use</b> <b>plan</b> is <b>legally</b> <b>binding.</b> This implies that, {{so far as}} {{regulation}} of land use is concerned, {{the effectiveness of the}} system as a whole is highly dependent on the effectiveness of this type of plan. There has been much debate on this issue and the 1985 revision of the Act on Spatial Planning was meant to resolve some of the most obvious problems. In this paper we review research being conducted on the performance of local <b>land-use</b> <b>plans,</b> discuss the effects of the 1985 revision in this respect, and make suggestions for developing a more robust model for local <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> {{within the framework of the}} present legislation. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The Hyogo Framework for Action {{focussed}} {{disaster risk}} reduction (DRR) on <b>land-use</b> <b>planning,</b> with international agencies, research organisations and national governments recognising {{the importance of}} DRR through hazard informed <b>land-use</b> <b>planning.</b> This paper aims to examine the roles of planners in reducing hazard risk through settlement design, <b>land-use</b> <b>plans</b> and legislation, and identify shortcomings and constraints towards achieving Disaster Risk Reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses community-based research from Australia, Thailand and Indonesia to discuss <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> in local governance frameworks following major disasters, including cyclone, flood and tsunami. Findings: This paper shows that <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> systems are still primarily geared toward promoting and facilitating development and have not evolved sufficiently {{to take account of}} DRR and climate change. Social implications: <b>Land-use</b> <b>planning</b> frameworks for hazard-resilient communities remain disconnected from the emergency management and disaster risk reduction systems. The goal to create disaster-resilient communities through the <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> systems requires a fundamental change {{to the way in which}} planning is conceptualised and practised. Social equity is also a huge issue where investment focuses on urban development. Originality/value: The study contributes to an understanding of the opportunities and constraints for <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> to enhance climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction through legislation, policies, regional and local statutory planning schemes, enforceable planning and development controls and building codes...|$|R

Traditional <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> rarely considers the impact of the geological environment. This paper takes a case study of Qingyang City and evaluates the geological environment on the basis of mining geo-environment background and field survey on geo-environment problems to form different regions which can guide the compilation of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning.</b> And then, this paper establishes the planning advice assemblage for different region...|$|R
40|$|<b>Land-use</b> <b>planning</b> is a {{decision-making}} process that facilitates {{the allocation of}} land to different uses that provide optimal and sustainable benefit. As land-use is shaped by society–nature interaction, in <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> different components/facets {{play a significant role}} involving soil, water, climate, animal (ruminant/ non-ruminant) and others, including forestry and the environment needed for survival of mankind. At times these components are moderated by human interference. Thus <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> being a dynamic phenomenon is not guided by a single factor, but by a complex system working simultaneously,which largely affects the sustainability. To address such issues a National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) on ‘Georeferenced soil information system for <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> and monitoring soil and land quality for agriculture’ was undertaken to develop threshold values of land quality parameters for <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> through quantitative land evaluation and crop modelling for dominant cropping systems in major agro-ecological sub-regions (AESRs) representing rice–wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and deep-rooted crops in the black soil regions (BSR). To assess the impact of landuse change, threshold land quality indicator values are used. A modified AESR map for agricultural landuse planning is generated for effective <b>land-use</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{the terms}} <b>land-use</b> <b>planning,</b> {{regional}} planning, urban planning, and urban design {{are often used}} interchangeably, and {{will depend on the}} state, county, and/or project in question. Despite confusing nomenclature, the essential function of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> remains the same whatever term is applied. The Canadian Institute of Planners offers a definition that <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> means the scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities. The American Planning Association states that the goal of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> is to further the welfare of people and their communities by creating convenient, equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive environments for present and future generations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Land-use</b> <b>planning</b> has {{triggered}} debates {{on social and}} environmental values, in which two key questions will be faced: one is how to see different planning simulation results instantaneously and apply the results back to interactively assist planning work; the other is how {{to ensure that the}} planning simulation result is scientific and accurate. To answer these questions, the objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze whether and how a bridge can be built between qualitative and quantitative approaches for <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> work and to find out a way to overcome the gap that exists between the ability to construct computer simulation models to aid integrated <b>land-use</b> <b>plan</b> making and the demand for them by planning professionals. The study presented a theoretical framework of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> based on scenario analysis (SA) method and multiagent system (MAS) simulation integration and selected freshwater wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of China as a case study area. Study results showed that MAS simulation technique emphasizing quantitative process effectively compensated for the SA method emphasizing qualitative process, which realized the organic combination of qualitative and quantitative <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> work, and then provided a new idea and method for the <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> and sustainable managements of land resources...|$|R

The research involved two case studies of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> processes: the Niagara Escarpment and Oak Ridges Moraine, Ontario, Canada. The two cases together reveal an evolution of <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> towards collaborative processes on mainly private lands in Southern Ontario {{during the period from}} 1960 to 2002.
