50|$|Forecasting is a {{precursor}} to actions, {{and there is no}} explicit way to get from the economic base to the kinds of actions most communities are interested in. That is, the economic base study does not say what to do. <b>Leaders</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> want desirable economic activities like high-tech ones. Indeed, we have seen studies of the transport needs of high-tech industries, studies done prior to investments to attract such industries (e.g., in Pennsylvania).|$|E

However, destructive cults apotheosize their chief leaders and regard them as the supreme authority. The chief <b>leaders</b> either <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are God or that they alone can interpret the scriptures the way God intended.

5000|$|Neo-Nazism is {{a growing}} {{political}} force in Mongolia. From 2008, Mongolian neo-Nazi groups have defaced buildings in Ulaanbaatar, smashed Chinese shopkeepers' windows, and killed pro-Chinese Mongols. The neo-Nazi Mongols' targets for violence are Chinese, Koreans, Mongol women {{who have sex with}} Chinese men, and LGBT people. They wear Nazi uniforms and revere the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan. Though Tsagaan Khass <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> do not support violence, they are self-proclaimed Nazis.

Veronica and Logan have a chance meeting in the elevator.|$|R
50|$|While the {{relationship}} with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. The bond strengthened after the 1997 flood devastated Grand Forks. Awano, a city of 10,000, sent $26,000 to help Grand Forks. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of {{the relationship}} between the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. Awano is no longer a sister city, however, because it is no longer a city. The nearby city of Kanuma recently annexed Awano, a smaller city. Kanuma city <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> already have a sister city in Australia and can't afford another one. The student exchange between the school districts is expected to continue.|$|E
5000|$|Early on September 21, 2016, the National Electoral Council set new {{guidelines}} for the recall campaign that The Associated Press described as [...] "unfavorable to the opposition."

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the discursive {{representation}} of women’s interests and needs in Makueni District, a rural area {{in the eastern part}} of Kenya. The study explores the mismatch between the way politicians and other community leaders select and represent these interests and needs and the way women construct these issues in women’s groups. It provides a fresh approach to the study of women’s issues by using a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a means of uncovering the subtle ways in which the representation of these issues interfaces with questions of power. The thesis explores the overall question: how does a study of the language used to talk about women’s interests and needs help us understand the constraints and possibilities for women with regard to agency and change? Data was collected from political rallies, interviews and focus group discussions. The data for the entire study consists of four political speeches, ten interviews with politicians and other community leaders and eleven focus group discussions with women’s groups. CDA as theory and method provides a framework for understanding how prevailing discourses impact on the participation of women in the political process in Kenya. A key finding of the research is that though women, politicians and other community leaders construct women’s agency within deficit discourses, these discourses do not match women’s enacted practices or what political and community <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> expect of women. The contradiction that emerges from the study is that although everyone constructs women as lacking in agency, these women act as agentive subjects. All these three categories of research participants draw on prevailing discourses about women in Kenya which locate women is a discourse of negative representation. This language reflects and reproduces the exclusion of women in the political process because it is hard for women to believe that they have a contribution to make when they are interpellated by these deficit discourses. Women for example continuously demand for a leader, a mentor and a saviour; an individualized discourse yet agency and sustainability depend on the collective. Further, my research has shown that women’s groups that are the focus of this study (popularly known as merry-go-rounds in Kenya) are not ‘feminist’ groups. While the aim of feminist groups is transformation, the aim of the women’s groups is sustainability. Overall, the study shows that women’s power is located in traditional discourse and collective action is at the heart of women’s ability to sustain their existence and their communities. Women’s inaction on the other hand is located in deficit discourses, a negative discourse on women. If they were to understand and recognize the power of the collective, and that power is in the collective and not in an individual leader, they might choose to influence the political process in a different way. Such understanding might provide different possibilities for political agency and transformation. The key finding of this research is the need to change the discourse of negative representation so that women can recognize their own potential for power...|$|E
2500|$|Early the {{following}} day, 24 August, Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local {{radio station in}} which he said the withdrawal from Bab al-Azizia had been a [...] "tactical" [...] move. The New York Times reported rebel <b>leaders</b> as <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> believed the only areas still under Gaddafi's control, other than the immediate neighbourhood of Bab al-Azizia, were al-Hadhba and Abu Salim, the latter including the Rixos Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days. However, the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli. Local hospitals and clinics, even in areas considered under rebel control, were reporting hundreds of cases of gunshot wounds and the death toll was impossible to estimate. By late afternoon the journalists trapped at the Rixos Hotel had been released while heavy fighting continued in the Abu Salim region close to Bab al-Azizia and elsewhere. The rebels were reported as estimating 400 people had been killed and a further 2,000 injured in the battle.|$|R
5000|$|At a {{press conference}} on 20 February 2008, he {{announced}} his party's support for constitutional amendments favored by the government, including the elimination of presidential term limits. Although other opposition leaders viewed the amendments as a transparent effort to allow Paul Biya to remain in power, Tchiroma argued that the amendments should be considered on their own merits. He particularly stressed his support for extending the 45-day period for organizing a new presidential election following a vacancy in the office, arguing that it was [...] "almost impossible" [...] to do so within that length of time. He also argued that removing the presidential term limits would promote a climate of peace and stability by avoiding the uncertainty associated with a presidential succession, {{and he said that}} would in turn encourage foreign investment in Cameroon. On the same occasion, Tchiroma criticized other opposition <b>leaders,</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> were power-hungry and would be willing to start a civil war, while also denying that he had been bribed into supporting the amendments; according to Tchiroma, he considered the arguments of both sides, consulted constitutional experts, and then concluded that the ruling party's position was correct.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, the Beagle Boys {{know of the}} trophy's value, {{and sought}} to enter the soccer tournament as well in order to [...] "walk away with the trophy, all nice and legal", rather than steal it. When one of the Beagle Boys {{comments}} {{they are out of}} shape and do not know anything about soccer, their <b>leader</b> <b>says</b> all <b>they</b> have to do is cheat. The tournament comes down to the McDuck Greenbacks facing the Beagle Boys in the finals; the Beagles decide Sport Goofy is a problem and kidnap him. The team is disheartened by the loss of their coach and team captain, but resolve to go on without him. Despite the excellent playing by the team members, the Beagle Boys engage in outright cheating and a nearsighted referee keeps declaring the Beagles' goals legit, ending the first half with a score of 10-0. Sport Goofy quietly escapes the Beagles' hideout and gets to the field for the second half. The return of Sport Goofy encourages the Greenbacks into incredible playing that not even the Beagles' cheating can counter, causing a comeback of 10-10.|$|R

[...] In April 2009, only one person had announced a candidacy, Rudy Garcia, the former mayor of Bell Gardens, California. In October 2009, national Democratic <b>leaders</b> were <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> were not bothering to recruit anyone to face McCain, but that same month, Tucson Councilman Rodney Glassman filed an exploratory committee for this Senate seat at the urging of Arizona Attorney General and Arizona gubernatorial candidate Terry Goddard.|$|R
5000|$|Ian Birrell, {{writing in}} The Independent, criticized Western <b>leaders,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> had done [...] "little more than talk tough" [...] and [...] "Their failure is symbolized by verbal {{acrobatics}} as they avoid {{using the word}} [...] "invasion", talking instead of [...] "incursion" [...] and [...] "aggression."" [...] Commenting on Barack Obamas refusal to send weapons to Ukraine {{as part of his}} policy of [...] "no military solution" [...] and avoiding escalation, The Washington Post said, [...] "weak U.S. and European support has allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to impose his own military solution as he has repeatedly escalated his aggression." [...] Foreign Policy stated [...] "The West has dithered under the assumption that providing lethal aid to Ukraine would escalate the conflict. But a sanctions-dominant approach clearly has not prevented escalation. Indeed, with Frances determination to sell the Mistral ships to Russia, the West is in the peculiar position of arming the aggressor and forbidding arms to the victim." [...] Paul A. Goble was critical of Western governments response, saying [...] "by signalling that it will not oppose a particular case of aggression, the West has taught Putin and his regime a lesson, but very much the wrong one: aggression works and after “a decent interval” will be ignored, have no consequences for relations with the West, and then can be repeated." [...] In September 2014, GlobalPosts Gregory Feifer commented on the Ukrainian perspective, stating, [...] "the arguments of some in the West who preach tolerance for Putin are generating anguish and disbelief - and increasingly outrage and hostility - toward the countries whose values Ukrainians believe theyre being left alone to defend." [...] In February 2015, Charles Crawford of The Telegraph concluded that Putin had been [...] "rewarded for his bullying." [...] At the same time, Joseph L. Black, Professor Emeritus of Carleton University and director of the Centre for Research on Canadian-Russian Relations, stated that [...] "the bewildering litany of legislated charges emanating from the US Congress blaming Russia, and Russia alone, for the violence and instability in Ukraine marked the epitome of blind name-calling".|$|R

When the thieves dare Egon to prove himself worthy of their company, Egon steals a doctor's bag from a parked car. Getting away easily, Egon becomes involved with crime. After brutally mugging a local butcher one evening, Egon and his buddies are arrested. Egon is sentenced to a home for juvenile delinquents. He meets the sympathetic Ruth (Anni Stangerup), who tries to encourage him to go straight, but finds she has little power to change him. When Egon is released from the juvenile home, he has lost his naivete and become a hardened criminal. He organizes a gang,proving himself a merciless <b>leader,</b> and <b>says</b> <b>they</b> will commit crimes [...] "the right way."

5000|$|A week later, however, more {{comments}} {{emerged from}} the interview. Tamihere was reported as being highly critical of women <b>leaders,</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> achieved their position through preferential treatment. He also stated that he was [...] "sick and tired of hearing how many Jews got gassed" [...] in the Holocaust, saying that while he found the Holocaust revolting, he believed that repeated mention of it was simply used to make people [...] "feel guilty". He also alleged that Clayton Cosgrove, previously believed {{to be one of}} Tamihere's closest allies in the party, had conducted a [...] "nasty" [...] campaign of telephone harassment against Clark and her husband when Clark deposed Mike Moore as party leader in 1993. These latest revelations were regarded by many as the end of Tamihere's career within the Labour Party, and Clark indicated that she saw no chance of Tamihere being elected to Cabinet again. The revelation of these comments also ended talk of a potential move to another party, the National Party being frequently mentioned, and also ended attempts by opposition parties in New Zealand to portray Tamihere as a victim of the Labour Party and to use the comments to point out the flaws within the Labour Party. At the Labour Party caucus meeting on 12 April, Tamihere attended despite being placed on stress leave by Clark. He apologised for his comments and was censured by the meeting, but was not asked to resign from the party.|$|R
