30|$|Many {{observations}} possibly {{related to}} seismo-lithospheric precursors of the earth’s surface magnetic field (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2006 a) and the GPS surface deformation, seismo-atmospheric precursors of the infrasound signal (Xia <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011), and seismo-ionospheric precursors (SIPs) in the {{electron density profile}} (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009), the electron temperature (Oyama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008), ion density (Oyama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011), and neutral temperature (Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011) probed by satellites have been reported. The total electron content (TEC) in the global ionosphere map (GIM) routinely published allows us to monitor temporal SIPs at a specific location and discriminate the observed SIPs (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001, 2009, 2010 a) from global effects, such as solar flares, magnetic storms, and so on. (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004 a). Statistical analyses for detecting both temporal and spatial precursors in the ionospheric TEC are developed (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004 b, 2010 b). Meanwhile, ionospheric model simulations are also introduced to find causal mechanisms explaining the observed SIPs (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011 a).|$|R
30|$|In {{a similar}} approach, <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> {{conducted}} a gain-of-function screen of cardiac development epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors and identified the H 3 K 4 methyltransferase Mll 1 {{as a barrier}} to direct cardiac reprogramming (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016 b). Pharmacologic inhibition of Mll 1 improves both iCM generation with a 1.5 -fold increase in αMHC-GFP reporter expression and iCM maturation with increased sarcomere assembly and spontaneous beating (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016 b). Inhibition of Mll 1 directs cardiomyocyte cell fate specification by suppressing adipocyte lineage transdifferentiation (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016 b). Mll 1 inhibition prevents MGT-mediated upregulation of adipocyte genes and adipocyte formation as indicated by Oil Red O staining (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016 b). The adipocyte associated gene Ebf 1 is a key target of Mll 1, and the reduction in Ebf 1 expression caused by Mll 1 inhibition mediates the observed increase in reprogramming efficiency (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016 b).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background For gene {{expression}} {{data obtained from}} a time-course microarray experiment, <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1 developed a new algorithm for clustering genes with similar expression profiles over time. Performance of their proposal was compared with three other methods including the order-restricted inference based methodology of Peddada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2 3. In this note we point out several inaccuracies in <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1 and conclude that the order-restricted inference based methodology of Peddada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (programmed in the software ORIOGEN) indeed operates at the desired nominal Type 1 error level, an important feature of a statistical decision rule, while being computationally substantially faster than indicated by <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1. Results Application of ORIOGEN to the well-known breast cancer cell line data of Lobenhofer <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 4 revealed that ORIOGEN software took only 21 minutes to run (using 100, 000 bootstraps with p = 0. 0025), substantially faster than the 72 hours found by <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1 using Matlab. Also, based on a data simulated according to the model and parameters of simulation 1 (σ 2 = 1, M = 5) in 1 we found that ORIOGEN took less than 30 seconds to run {{in stark contrast to}} <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> who reported that their implementation of the same algorithm in R took 2979. 29 seconds. Furthermore, for the simulation studies reported in 1, unlike the claims made by <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1, ORIOGEN always maintained the desired false positive rate. According to Figure three in <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1 their algorithm had a false positive rate ranging approximately from 0. 20 to 0. 70 for the scenarios that they simulated. Conclusions Our comparisons of run times indicate that the implementations of ORIOGEN's algorithm in Matlab and R by <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1 is inefficient compared to the publicly available JAVA implementation. Our results on the false positive rate of ORIOGEN suggest some error in Figure three of <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1, perhaps due to a programming error. </p...|$|R

It is noted that the NmF 2 is the electron density at the F 2 -peak, about 300 #x 2013; 500 -km altitude, while VTEC is the integration from a ground-based receiver to the GPS satellite orbit at about 20, 200 km altitude (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2004). <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2001) showed that two measurements of NmF 2 and GPS TEC had similar tendencies and were highly correlated. Hence, the GPS TEC can be employed to detect seismo-ionosphere signatures. <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2004) also proposed that the TEC anomalies initialized near the Earth’s surface, then extended upward to a higher altitude. The anomalous reductions of electron densities {{may be attributed to}} the seismo-electromagnetic signals that topically affect the ionospheric plasma (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2009). <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2009) showed that the eastward plasma E × B drift may result in the abnormal enhancement of TEC slightly shifting to the east of the epicenter.|$|R

30|$|The {{advances}} in {{pluripotent stem cell}} and gene editing techniques have opened a new avenue to study the pathogenesis of human premature aging syndromes and aging-related diseases (Fu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012 b; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014; Lo Cicero and Nissan, 2015; Miller <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013; Pan <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2015). They also provide a powerful platform for drug screening and validation of their efficacy (Blondel <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2016; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012 a; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012 b; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014; Yang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). We have recently developed a human stem cell model by homozygous depletion of the exons 15 and 16 of WRN alleles, which recapitulates the major cellular defects of WS, including accelerated senescence, growth arrest, telomere attrition, increased DNA damage response, excessive production of inflammatory factors, as well as increased stem cell attrition in the in vivo niche (Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2015). We also identify heterochromatin disorganization as a driver for WS MSC aging, and overexpression of heterochromatin component HP 1 α can partially rescue the accelerated aging defects in the WS MSCs (Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2015). These findings suggest that epigenetic alterations could underlie human cellular aging, and the “epigenetic aging” can be repressed or reversed under specific context. It is unknown, however, if the premature aging processes can be alleviated by chemicals or drugs.|$|R

Various therapeutic sequences have been tested to achieve this goal, including the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (FGF- 2), the sex-determining region Y-type high-mobility group box (SOX) family of transcription factors, zinc finger protein 145 (ZNF 145), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), Wnt 11, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against p 53 and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) (Babister <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008; Cucchiarini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Cucchiarini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; Frisch <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; Haleem-Smith <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Huang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010; Ikeda <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004; Jeon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Kim and Im 2011; Lee <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Neumann <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; Pagnotto <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007; Steinert <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Steinert <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Tao <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Venkatesan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012).

Of note, HGPS-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and WS-specific iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been separately generated. Based on the findings by us and other groups, although the iPSCs and ESCs do not have any premature aging defects, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from these pluripotent stem cells display premature aging, consistent with the observations in fibroblasts from HGPS and WS patients (Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2017; Cheung <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014; <b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011 a; Miller <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013; Zhang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011).

The classifiers that have hitherto been used for signal peak detection include rule-based (Dumpala <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1982; Adam <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Dingle <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1993), AdaBoost (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2002), radial basis function network (Acir <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2005), support vector machine (SVM) (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013), radial basis support vector machine (Acir <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2005), artificial neural network (ANN) (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2002), and expert system (<b>Liu</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2002; Dingle <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1993).
