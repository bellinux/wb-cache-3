The buckling-restrained braces(BRBs) with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength(LYS) steel {{make good}} use of {{ductility}} and hysteretic energy dissipation of the <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel and are gradually applied in structural vibration. To foster BRBs with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel in China mainland, the domestic LYS 160 was used in BRB. The cross section was a simple shape. A static cyclic test was carried out, and the finite element analysis was conducted. The results show that the BRB with domestic <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel has good ductility, hysteretic energy dissipation and resistance to fatigue. A shaped cross section is simple and easy to promote application in China mainland...|$|R

40|$|Rhombic mild-steel plate damper (also named rhombic added damping and Stiffness (RADAS)) is a newly {{proposed}} and developed bending energy dissipation damper in recent years, and its mechanical properties, seismic behavior, and engineering application still need further investigations. In {{order to determine}} the basic mechanical performance of RADAS, fundamental material properties tests of three types of mild-steel specimen including domestically developed mild-steel material with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength were carried out. Then, a quasistatic loading test was performed to evaluate the mechanical performance and hysteretic energy dissipation capacity of these rhombic mild-steel dampers manufactured by aforementioned three types of steel materials. Test results show that yield strength of domestically developed <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel (LYS) is remarkably lower than that of regular mild steel and its ultimate strain is also 1 / 3 larger than that of regular mild steel, indicating that the <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel has a favorable plastic deformation capability. The rhombic mild-steel plate damper with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel material possesses smaller yield force and superior hysteretic energy dissipation capacity; thus they can be used to reduce engineering structural vibration and damage during strong earthquakes...|$|R
