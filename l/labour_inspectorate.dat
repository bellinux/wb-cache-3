40|$|Abstract. In {{a report}} {{released}} in 2006, the ILO highlighted the difficulties of labour inspection in its member States and advocated a number of measures to strengthen its effectiveness. The author argues that inspectorates must go beyond calls for more inspectors by adopting a clear strategic framework for reacting to incoming com-plaints and targeting programmed investigations {{in order to maximize}} effectiveness in the use of their overstretched resources. To do so, he proposes, their work must be guided by the principles of prioritization, deterrence, sustainability and achieving systemic effects. The article concludes with an outline of the requirements of a coher-ent regulatory strategy. he problem facing national governments in regulating conditions in theT workplace is daunting. Public policies on health and safety, discrimination and basic labour conditions often cover millions of workers, located in hundreds of thousands of workplaces across dispersed geographic settings. Conditions within those workplaces vary enormously – even within a single industry – and employers often have an incentive to make those conditions as opaque as pos-sible. Trade unions, which have been the traditional allies of government regula-tors in targeting and conducting inspections, are in sharp decline in many developed and developing countries. And, most challenging of all, government <b>labour</b> <b>inspectorates</b> face diminishing budgets, shrinking staff, and a more com-plicated and difficult regulatory environment. Recently, the International Labour Organization acknowledged the crisis in labour inspection nationally and internationally. In late 2006, the ILO called upon its member States to adopt a series of policies to strengthen and modern-ize <b>labour</b> <b>inspectorates</b> as a means of assuring implementation of fundamental workplace policies. In pursuing its broad “Decent Work Agenda ” the ILO’s Governing Body Committee on Employment and Social Policy noted...|$|R

This article argues {{that many of the}} claims that an increase in atypical forms promotes less rigid labour markets rely on narrow readings of official statistics and also underestimate different local labour realities. Drawing upon case studies in Thessaloniki's <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspectorates</b> and industrial enterprises, it highlights the fact that Greek labour markets, which are already flexible enough, have been rearranged to accommodate new use patterns for atypical forms, both traditional and modern. A controversially expanding trend towards part-time and temporary work and non-agricultural self-employment is discussed. This trend is traced to trades, sectors, industries and firms that have developed distinct patterns in the exploitation of atypical employment within the context of locally constituted social and regulatory practices that interact with globalized capital accumulation procedures. The expansion of atypical employment is examined along two interpretative lines, the one focusing on the effect of recent reforms on small industrial enterprises, the other analysing post-Fordist, flexible socio-spatial restructurings.

5000|$|The {{investigation}} of the cause of collapse was hindered by the collapsed building still being unsafe to enter. The remaining constructions were reinforced by March 2014. From April 2014, investigators were finally able to enter the building, where they recovered evidence buried by the third collapse of the roof and carried out investigation experiments - a controlled collapse of the remaining section of the roof and controlled fires, to test what loads the roof could carry and if the building's structures could have been compromised in the fire which occurred during its construction. The preliminary findings from the controlled collapse, which took place from 14 April to 17 April showed prolonged deformation of the metal support structures, which started well before the target weight of the roof was reached and ended with the constructions eventually breaking, suggesting that the roof was built improperly and the actual collapse was not caused by a sudden change, but by overloading structures for a prolonged {{period of time and}} possibly metal fatigue. Two controlled fires were set on 27 May. The police did not disclose preliminary results of this experiment and said that they aim to complete investigation in late fall.

This article aims to contribute to this mounting comparative and socio-legal literature by considering the emergence of an active and high-profile enforcement agency in Australia-the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO). Drawing on the experiences of inspectors and senior managers at the FWO, we examine the structure and mandate of the agency, as well as the discretion afforded to, and the professionalisation of, individual inspectors. While some have sought to draw a distinction between a rule-bound, specialised approach characteristic of certain Anglo-American countries and the so-called Franco-Iberian model, which places a greater emphasis on flexibility and pragmatism, we found that the FWO does not necessarily fit neatly within this dichotomy. Rather, we observe that as the FWO is a new institution, its mode of operation {{is in the process of}} evolution.

40|$|Background: Little {{research}} {{exists on}} the effectiveness of workplace visits by labour inspectors in relation to psychosocial risks. The study aimed to produce a consistent and transferable evidence-based framework. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using the realist synthesis approach. Searches in three electronic databases, systematic hand-searches in five specialised journals and iterative purposive searches yielded 25 publications. The initial search included any study between 2000 and 2015 containing information on <b>labour</b> <b>inspectorates</b> and psychosocial risks or stress at work. We conducted a complementary search to identify publications from French-speaking authors. Results: The synthesis yielded a conceptual model relating public intervention measures, mechanisms of action, outcomes and contexts. Publications indicate positive outcomes in 4 cases, possibly positive in 2, mixed outcomes in 4, and no or poor effects in 10. Studies from Nordic countries show some positive outcomes of inspection activities based on dialogue with employers, group interviews with employees, repeated visits and combinations with other communication and information channels, in the context of highly organised labour markets. Conversely, other studies highlight the limitations of intervention strategies that rely on an “enlightenment” principle, in a context of increasingly precarious and flexible work situations. Conclusion: The synthesis suggests the possibility of positive outcomes of inspectors’ interventions on psychosocial risks in supportive contexts and with appropriate training and resources. However, strong evidence is lacking and more evaluation studies are necessary. A comprehensive conceptual framework may help to analyse the wide range of factors influencing the effectiveness of workplace visits by inspectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{enlargement}} of the European Union, which incorporated post-communist countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), placed relatively little emphasis on the equal opportunities of men and women. However, acceding countries were required to implement Chapter 13 (‘Employment and social affairs’) of the acquis communautaire, which includes legislative provisions promoting gender equality in the workplace. This paper considers {{the extent to which}} the equality acquis has been transposed, implemented, and enforced in ten CEE countries. It begins by examining the pre- 89 equality infrastructure, which provides a comparative basis for the paper’s substantive analysis of the implementation of the ten equality directives. In particular, it discusses the legal mechanisms used to implement the legislation, evaluates whether pre- 89 provisions have been strengthened or weakened, and highlights remaining problems in harmonisation. Next, the paper evaluates awareness of the equality directives among women, employers and judges. It analyses the enforcement of these directives by <b>labour</b> <b>inspectorates</b> and ombudspersons, while also noting the limited case law. It then examines relations between CEE governments and both NGOs and trade unions, considering whether these bodies are promoting awareness and enforcement of the equality legislation. In conclusion, the paper argues that legislative harmonisation has legitimised women’s claim to genuine equality but has made only a marginal change in practice as women remain numerically weaker than men and hold less favourable positions in most areas.

Bérégovoy forced Bernard Tapie, his Minister of Urban Affairs, to resign in May 1992 after his indictment by the French justice. He thus created the misnamed [...] "Balladur jurisprudence". In social policy, a number of reforms were carried out.

50|$|The Act {{replaced}} the previous legislation, largely removing voluntary adult (age 18 and over) prostitution from {{the criminal law}} {{and replacing it with}} civil law at both national and local level. A distinction was made between voluntary and involuntary prostitution. It remains a crime to coerce someone to provide sexual services. Sex work is also prohibited for those on temporary visas, and immigration for and investment in sex work is prohibited. Contracts between provider and client were recognised, and providers have the right to refuse services. Contested contracts can be referred to the Disputes Tribunal. Advertising is banned, with the exception of print media, which is restricted. The Summary Offences Act remains in force in relation to soliciting, which may be classed as offensive behaviour. The Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 also allows sex workers to apply for previous convictions to be removed from the record. Sex work is recognised (but not promoted) as legitimate work by Work and Income New Zealand, who may not advertise vacancies in brothels or suggest people start sex work as a means of getting off a benefit. Now, workplace safety and health rules, developed in consultation with the prostitutes' collective, apply to sex work. Employment disputes can be referred to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> and Mediation Service. There is an obligation on employers and employees to practise and promote safe sexual practices. The Ministry of Health has the responsibility for enforcement. Registration of indoor sex workers with the police was replaced by certification at an administrative law level of brothel operators. Prior records have been destroyed. Refusal of a certificate is permitted for prior criminal offences (not necessarily related to prostitution). Police activities changed from the registration and prosecution of sex workers to protection. The Police Manual of Best Practice was amended to include prostitution.|$|E

Tanja could be evicted before the baby would be born. Tanja’s smoking during pregnancy were debated in the media, as well as the role of the father who didn’t want any responsibility but enjoyed his fame.On 18 October 2005 Tanja gave birth to her daughter Joscelyn Savanna in front of the cameras, a Big Brother first.

40|$|Enterprise {{restructuring}} can {{no longer}} be understood as a temporal crisis. Current developments show that for many organizations and even regions or sectors restructuring became a recurrent and continuous process. But often restructuring processes fail to produce the intended effects of secured or increased organizational profitability. On the contrary restructuring puts the physical and psycho-social health of all organizational members at risk. Besides the uncovering of pre-existing health problems, also the chronification of these illnesses had to be documented both for laid-off workers and survivors of the restructuring. But not only increased rates of sick leave and presenteeism of sick employees deteriorate the organizational performance. Some of the irritations that restructuring can cause also directly impede inner-organizational interactions. Therefore, restructuring should be understood as an individual as well as an organizational stressor. To limit the risks of enterprise restructuring effectively, several groups of actors at the individual, enterprise and societal level have to collaborate towards the implementation of healthier change procedures and to create a social convoy in occupational transitions for workers affected by dismissal. The European Expert Group on Health in Restructuring (HIRES) was coordinated by Prof. Dr. Thomas Kieselbach from the University of Bremen and supported by DG Employment of the European Commission. It presents with this report a concise overview of the effects of enterprise restructuring and the social frameworks and change procedures that should be considered for “healthier restructuring”. The results of this project are based on the interdisciplinary expertises from 15 European project partners and 12 external experts. With its policy recommendations and the case studies of innovative approaches on a company and regional level the report addresses policy makers, governmental structures like <b>labour</b> <b>inspectorates</b> or federal institutes, unions, managers, occupational health and safety personnel, shareholders and workers alike.

40|$|One of the {{perennial}} preoccupations of international labour law is how and through what mechanisms {{to develop more}} efficient labour market institutions. This is also a question that has long vexed the International Labour Organisation (ILO), particularly in relation to labour institutions in poorer countries.

A RA tool {{can be used to}} perform a risk assessment including an evaluation of the identified risks. These tools were among the first online risk assessment tools developed in Europe. The Dutch RA tools and the web application system to generate RA tools has inspired EU-OSHA to use the Dutch model as a basis for developing the Online Interactive Risk Assessment (OiRA). OiRA is a European web application, consisting of a tools generator and interface. OiRA helps Sectoral Social Partners (employers' and employees' organisations) and National Authorities (Ministries, <b>Labour</b> <b>Inspectorates,</b> OSH institutes, etc.) to produce sector-specific risk assessment tools (RA tools) targeting small businesses. The overall purpose of the Dutch digital RA tools as they stand today is to ensure that SMEs primarily, but micro enterprises in particular, comply with the legal obligations to execute a risk assessment and to reduce the administrative and financial burden on them in doing so. Other companies may use the tool, but they do not get the ‘bonuses’ that small companies get. Furthermore the aim is to improve their level of health and safety; to improve general awareness about the existence of the RA tools and finally to stimulate the development by the social partners of new sector-specific RA tools. Nowadays 182 sector-specific RA tools are available online on the website (www. rie. nl), either via a direct link or if the specific tool is not digital there is at least the contact details of the relevant sector organisation from which the paper-based risk assessment tool can be obtained. Sixty-nine of the RA tools are generated with the OiRA tool generator. The sector-specific digital RA tools are easy to use and the business owner only needs to answer questions that are really relevant to his/her particular field. The intention was that {{you should be able to}} complete the RA including the action plan, within 2 hours. Sometimes it is less, sometimes it takes more time, depending on the content of the tool.
