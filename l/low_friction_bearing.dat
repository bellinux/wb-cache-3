Passing current between the two electrodes typically results in failure of the outermost shell only {{on one side of the}} nanotube. Current is therefore passed between one electrode and the center of the MWNT which results in the failure of the outermost shell between this electrode and the center.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in the use of structured surfaces to provide specific functional performance. Such surfaces often consist of localised micro-scale surface features with predetermined geometries. The performance of the feature manufacturing process affects the functional performance of the surface, and can be assessed by measurement of the resulting surface features. Measurement of the resulting micromanufactured surface features necessitates use of areal optical surface topography instruments. However, conventional characterisation methods, based on areal surface texture parameters, often prove inadequate, and may fail to capture the relevant geometric properties needed for an effective dimensional verification. This paper investigates an alternative route to verification, based on the determination of geometric attributes of the microfabricated features. This approach allows for direct assessment of manufacturing process performance, by comparison of the geometric attributes with their nominal values. An example application is shown in which a micromachining process (laser texturing) is used to fabricate a periodic pattern of dimples, which provide a <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In this paper, manufacturing process performance is assessed by characterisation of the diameter and out-of-roundness. Sources of uncertainty associated with these geometric parameters are also considered...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} experimentally that two drops (or a single drop and a planar surface) of the same liquid {{can be made to}} resist coalescence under certain conditions which lead to relative motion of the interfaces. Such relative motion may be brought about through the mechanism of thermocapillarity of forced convection motion of one of the interfaces. Such non-coalescence phenomena have been observed to persist for hours, indicative of the stability of the phenomena. This stability, in turn, implies that such non-coalescence may be put to use in a microgravity environment.

40|$|Compliant layered {{bearings}} {{could improve}} {{the useful life}} of replacement load-bearing joints. By incorporating an elastic bearing material, fluid film separation of the articulating surfaces can be maintained and so <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> and negligible wear should occur. Compliant bearings are still under development and so require extensive testing {{before they can be}} implanted. To give a realistic evaluation of their performance, the test conditions must be representative of the in vivo situation. To date this has meant using joint simulators. A simplified test method has been developed to measure the friction of compliant layered bearings. It uses a reciprocating materials-screening apparatus adapted to include a dynamic load, very <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>bearings,</b> and a curved counterface. It has been validated by comparison with simulator tests and predictions made from Hertzian contact and elastohydrodynamic theories. An alternative to the Sommerfeld parameter been defined to allow comparison of the different test methods. Tests have shown that of the parameters which affect friction, the predicted Hertzian contact area was the most important. Similar predicted areas gave rise to similar coefficients of friction in both mixed and fluid film lubrication regimes. The simplified method showed improved repeatability and lower systematic errors than the simulator. The method has been used to examine the effect of design factors on the friction generated in compliant layered bearings, comparing the results obtained with those of the simulator. Increased load, decreased counterface roughness, increased entraining velocity and the use of a compliant layer over UHMWPE all reduced the coefficient of friction. Bearing conformity had a mixed effect on friction. Point contacts and line contacts showed similar trends. The mechanical properties of the compliant materials have also been considered including hardness, hysteresis in compression, and creep...|$|R

40|$|To run both {{smoothly}} and efficiently, high-speed machines need stable, <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>bearings</b> {{to support their}} rotor. Being oil-free, self-acting gas film bearings are often the choice in high speed rotating machinery. Although plain aerostatic journal bearings carry more load and have superior lift characteristics, they suffer from instability problems, and one can add grooves to 'increase that stability. The research describe a mathematical model developed for small eccentricities, to predict the steady state and stability of enhanced capacity air bearings which combine external pressurisation and aerodynamic effects by adding grooves. This theory was than tested in a practical bearing design application. With {{the aid of a}} computer program geometry and thus load capacity, stiffness and stability were optimised. A prototype bearing based on a standard aerostatic bearing spindle, was designed, produced and tested. Stiffness, load capacity, pressure distribution and stability were monitored experimentally. The effects of the attitude angle on stability are discussed and it is concluded that the attitude angle is an unreliable predictor of bearing stability. Experimental dynamic stability studies have been carried out and the initial bearing spindle was operated with known amounts of unbalance at speeds up to 105000 rpm, with a gas supply pressure of 6 bar. The spindle vibration amplitude was measured and coherence data and dynamic compliance functions of the bearing were determined. The critical speeds were determined by monitoring the natural frequency amplitudes of the bearing spindle. Having observed some positive dynamic benefits of a prototype hybrid spindle, the work was followed up with a further test on a hybrid spindle with improved bearing geometry. The natural frequencies were observed, and the critical speeds determined. The bearing successfully reached the maximum 120000 rpm speed predicted by the theoretical model for the bearing design, and at all speed the spindle remained stable. The main contribution is in improved stability and increased speed capacity of a hybrid externally pressurised bearing by adding optimised geometry grooves which further enhanced the control of pressure distribution for bearings used in high speed spindle applications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Rolamite architecture exploiting shape-memory alloys {{as power}} element {{to obtain a}} solid-state actuator. The Rolamite mechanism was discovered in the late 1960 s, initially as precision and <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> linear <b>bearing.</b> The most common Rolamite configuration consists of a flexible thin metal strip and two rollers mounted between two fixed parallel guide surfaces. The system can roll back and forth without slipping guided by the plates along its so-called sensing axis. The system presents another relevant advantage in addition to <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient, which is the possibility to provide force generation in a quite simple way. In the original literature works, the force was provided, thanks to cut-outs of various shapes in the strip, although this method does not allow the Rolamite {{to be considered a}} proper actuator, but only a force generator. In this article, we developed the idea of exploiting the shape-memory alloy as Rolamite power element, and therefore, to use the shape-memory effect to change the elastic properties of the strip and to provide the actuation force. The mechanical analysis, where the martensite–austenite transition is modelled in a simplified way, shows that this application is feasible, mainly thanks to the initial precurvature of the shape-memory alloy strip. The discussion of the results highlights some important merits of this architecture such as long stroke, constant force and compactness...|$|R
40|$|When a ship {{carrying}} {{liquid cargo}} moves in waves, sloshing may occur. The ship motions excite sloshing which in return aects the ship motions. 2 -D experiments on a box-shaped ship section excited by regular beam sea {{have been conducted}} to study this coupling eect. The section contains two tanks and can only move in sway. The external ship motion problem may be solved by using a standard linear strip theory program, while the sloshing must be described by a nonlinear method.

The side walls and the bottom of the ume are made of glass. Fig. 1 shows model parameters. The ship section with an overall length of 596 mm has 2 mm clearance from the ume walls. The breadth is 400 mm and the draft 200 mm. The two identical tanks have breadth b of 376 mm, a length of 150 mm and a height of 288 or 388 mm depending on the position of the deck.
