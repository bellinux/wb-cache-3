6000|$|... "Of course, it wasn't long till I couldn't get no backers, and I didn't {{have any}} more chances to fight a professional--or many amateurs, either.

6000|$|NOTARY. Now, <b>lemme</b> <b>tell</b> you: {{marriage}} is a contract to which there are two constracting parties. That being clear, I am prepared to argue categorically that your son Charles--who, it appears, is not your son Charles--I am prepared to argue that one {{party to a contract}} being null and void, the other party to a contract cannot by law oblige or constrain the first party to constract or bind himself to any contract, except the other party be able to see his way clearly to constract himself with him. I donno if I make myself clear? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, I {{guess that}} was it. Do you {{remember}} how you gave us an imitation of him telling the class that if they'd work like sixty they might get to be little tin gods on wheels like himself, and how he'd always keep dropping his eye-glasses and fishing 'em up on a cord while he was talking--don't you remember how you took him off? Why, I thought Mrs. Hunt-that-is--I've forgotten what her name was before Sandy married her--why, I thought she'd split, laughing.

6000|$|Una {{surmised that}} {{the writers of}} such novels might, perhaps, desire to show the bad side {{in the hope that}} life might be made more beautiful. But she wasn't quite sure of it, and she {{suffered}} herself to be overborne, when he snorted: [...] "Nonsense! These fellas are just trying to show how sensational they can be, t' say nothing of talking like they was so damn superior to the rest of us. Don't read 'em. Read pure authors like Howard Bancock Binch, where, whenever any lady gets seduced or anything like that, the author shows it's because the villain is an atheist or something, and he treats all those things in a nice, fine, decent manner. Good Gawd! sometimes a fella 'd think, to see you scrooge up your nose when I'm shaving, that I'm common as dirt, but <b>lemme</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> right now, miss, I'm a darn sight too refined to read any of these nasty novels where they go to the trouble of describing homes that ain't any better than pig-pens. Oh, and another thing! I heard you telling Mrs. Sanderson you thought all kids oughta have sex education. My Gawd! I don't know where you get those rotten ideas! Certainly not from me. <b>Lemme</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> no kid of mine is going to be made nasty-minded by having a lot of stuff like that taught her. Yes, sir, actually taught her right out in school." ...|$|E
6000|$|Letty and her son, Plez, {{occupied}} a cabin {{not far from}} the house, while Uncle Isham lived alone in a much smaller tenement, near the barn and chicken house. That evening he went over to Letty's, taking with him, as a burnt offering, a partially consumed and still glowing log of hickory wood from his own hearth-stone. [...] "Jes' <b>lemme</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> dis h'yar, Letty," [...] said he, after making up the fire and seating himself on a stool near by, [...] "ef you want to see ole miss come back rarin' an' chargin', jes' you let her know dat Miss Null is gwine ter plough de clober fiel' for pickles." ...|$|E
6000|$|He often said, with a {{sound of}} pride: [...] "We don't care a darn for all these would-be social climbers. The wife and I lead a regular Bohemian life.

Why, if old Gogie {{had to keep}} track of seventy-'leven accounts and watch every single last movement of a fool girl that can't even run the adding-machine, why, he'd get green around the gills. He'd never do anything but make mistakes! Well, I guess the old codger must have had a bum breakfast this morning. Wanted some exercise to digest it. Me, I was the exercise--I was the goat.

No, sir, you'll do what I say from now on. I've been tied to your apron strings long enough, and now I'm the boss--see? Me!" [...] He tapped his florid bosom. [...] "You used to be plenty glad to go to poker parties and leg-shows with me, when I wanted to, but since you've taken to earning your living again you've become so ip-de-dee and independent that when I even suggest rushing a growler of beer you scowl at me, and as good as say you're too damn almighty good for Eddie Schwirtz's low-brow amusements.
