5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game too short and felt it failed to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger plays a {{major part}} in the episode, as the South Park boys are {{inspired}} to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does not <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they failed to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire {{similar to that of}} the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E

25|$|The 1935 Constitution {{was written}} in 1934, {{approved}} and adopted by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935–1946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946–1972).

Stamps.com claimed that PayPal did not <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> contractual obligations and accused eBay of interfering with PayPal and Stamps.com's agreement, hence Stamp.com's reasoning for including eBay in the suit.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, dubbed Operation Off Balance, {{the plan}} tried to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> name by kicking off hurriedly on 1 July 1969, {{three days after}} it was proposed. The Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 (Warrior Battalion 206) was helilifted to a landing zone at the old Operation Momentum base at San Luang. They moved out on foot northeastward toward the objective. Neutralist Bataillon Commando 208 (Commando Battalion 208), which had been regrouped at Xieng Dat after their flight from Muang Soui, marched eastward to join that column. In a {{separate}} move, the paratroop battalion, 101 Bataillon de Parachutistes (101st Parachute Battalion), was helicoptered to Ban Na, southeast of the objective, to begin their approach march. In a third part of the operation, the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 201 (Warrior Battalion 201) paired with the Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 (Battalion of Infantry 15); they were helicoptered to Phou So to walk south to Muang Soui.|$|E

25|$|The Deuteronomistic Historians, who {{redacted}} the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings), idealized Samuel as {{a figure}} who is larger than life like Joshua. Samuel's father, Elkanah, is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, {{which was part of}} the tribal lands of Ephraim, while the Books of Chronicles state that he was a Levite. Samuel is a judge who leads the military like in the Book of Judges and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6–17, the Deuteronomic Historians composed a speech of Samuel that portrays him as the judge sent by God to save Israel. In 1 Samuel 9:6–20, Samuel is seen as a local “seer”. The Deuteronomistic Historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as “the first of prophets to articulate the failure of Israel to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> covenant with God.” For the Deuteronomistic Historians, Samuel was an extension of Moses and continuing Moses’ function as a prophet, judge, and priest, which made historical Samuel uncertain.|$|E

Actually, it starts a little slowly but builds steam along the way. It includes some classic moments of a Homer idiocy— hard to beat him chasing squirrels with a stick— and one of the better visual gags via Burns’ chair. Who can dislike a show in which Richard Nixon threatens Homer due to a drunken pig?" [...] The episode's reference to The Untouchables was named the 13th greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–". He {{felt that it}} was {{appropriate}} that Steve Carell's time on the series was bookended largely by the Dundies; he noted that the episode in which the awards were introduced—the eponymous second season entry—served as [...] "a second pilot of sorts" [...] for the series, and the idea to bring the Dundies back made sense at the time in order to see how the characters had grown. However, he felt that the episode at large did not <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> source material, and that it was [...] "occasionally funny but unfortunately meaningless". The ending song, however, in McNutt's opinion, was a highlight of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the general dungeon-clearing gameplay, the combat itself was criticized by reviewers like Padilla, who said that [...] "the weapon use is the most disappointing facet of this game". Both Fahey and Mueller felt that the combat, while initially fun, quickly became boring due to the simplicity. Chandran added that magic spells were too slow to be useful in combat, further reducing {{the complexity of the}} gameplay. Chandran and GamePro both criticized the [...] "sparse and slow" [...] story, while Fahey dismissed it as [...] "a gossamer-thin layer which tries and fails miserably to hold everything together" [...] and nothing more than several role-playing game clichés stuck together. Padilla concluded that while the game had several good elements, it ultimately failed to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> potential as a Mana game.|$|E
