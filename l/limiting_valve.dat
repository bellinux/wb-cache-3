By tracing with the discharge pressure of hydraulic pump, HPLVs are used to real-time control the pilot pressure that corresponds to the displacement of hydraulic pump, and match the output power of hydraulic pump {{with the power of}} its prime mover within high efficiency scope. So good dynamics is important for HPLVs to reflect the frequently change of pump pressure. Based on the description of a typical HPLV with two-spring structure, its principle and the working process are discussed, then the mathematical model is established and the effects of several main structural parameters on its dynamic characteristics are carried out...|$|E

These safety systems are required to prevent excessive accelerations that could injure personnel and damage simulator cockpits or the motion base structure.

Such commands may result from single order failures of electrical or hydraulic components within the control system itself, or from aggressive or improper cueing commands from the host simulation computer. The safety systems must mitigate these high acceleration events while minimizing the negative performance impacts. The system accomplishes this by controlling the rate of change of valve signals to limit excessive commanded accelerations. It also aids hydraulic cushion performance by <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> command authority as the actuator approaches its end of travel.

40|$|Introduction: Increasedlife {{expectancy}} in populations {{has brought}} along specific new scenarios {{in the fields}} of medicine for the elderly; prevalence of physical complications such as edentulism and patients with dentures is growing. Management of anesthesia and ventilation in this group of patients has turned into a great challenge. Some researchers suggest dentures to be left in place during bag-mask ventilation; yet, no unanimous agreement exists in this regard. Methods: In a single blind randomized clinical trial, we studied 300 patients with ASA class I, II (American Society of Anesthesiologists), Mallampati class (I, II) and aged over 55 years in three groups. After induction of anesthesia, in group G dentures were removed and in each buccal space an eight-layer 10 × 10 cm gauze and an oral airway were placed. In group D, the dentures and an oral airway were left in place. In group C (control), after removing dentures just an appropriate oral airway was placed. Then, each three group underwent bag-mask ventilation. Success of bag-mask ventilation (BMV) was considered as increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide to more than 20 mmHg and back to baseline with fresh gas flow of 3 L/min and adjustable pressure <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. Success rates were evaluated between groups. Results: Effective BMV was possible in 91 (91 %), 64 (64 %) and 41 (41 %) patients in groups G, D and C respectively. The differences were statistically significant. Successful BMV rate was significantly higher in female patients in group G compared to group C; 43 / 44 versus 25 / 46 individuals, P = 0. 0001, odds ratio = 0. 03, 95 % confidence interval (0. 00, 0. 22). Conclusions: Leaving dentures in place in edentulous patients after inducing anesthesia improves bag-mask ventilation. However, placing folded compressed gauze in buccal space leads to more significant improvement in BMV compared to leaving dentures in place...|$|E

The purpose of our {{study was to determine}} success rates of bag-mask ventilation and tracheal intubation performed by emergency medicine residents before and after completing their anesthesiology curriculum. Methods A prospective descriptive study was conducted at Nikoukari Hospital, a teaching hospital located in Tabriz, Iran. In a skills lab, a total number of 18 emergency medicine residents (post graduate year 1) were given traditional intubation and bag-mask ventilation instructions in a 36 hour course combined with mannequin practice. Later the residents were given the opportunity of receiving training on airway management in an operating room for a period of one month which was considered as an additional training program added to their Anesthesiology Curriculum. Residents were asked to ventilate and intubate 18 patients (Mallampati class I and ASA class I and II) in the operating room; both before and after completing this additional training program. Intubation achieved at first attempt within 20 seconds was considered successful. Successful bag-mask ventilation was defined as increase in ETCo 2 to 20 mm Hg and back to baseline with a 3 L/min fresh gas-flow and the adjustable pressure <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> at 20 cm H 2 O. An attending anesthesiologist who was always present in the operating room during the induction of anesthesia confirmed the endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and capnography. Success rates were recorded and compared using McNemar, marginal homogeneity and paired t-Test tests in SPSS 15 software. Results Before the additional training program in the operating room, the participants had intubation and bag-mask ventilation success rates of 27. 7 % (CI 0. 07 - 0. 49) and 16. 6 % (CI 0 - 0. 34) respectively. After the additional training program in the operating room the success rates increased to 83. 3 % (CI 0. 66 - 1) and 88. 8 % (CI 0. 73 - 1), respectively. The differences in success rates were statistically significant (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 0004, respectively). Conclusions The success rate of emergency medicine residents in airway management improved significantly after completing anesthesiology rotation. Anesthesiology rotations should be considered as an essential component of emergency medicine training programs. A collateral curriculum of this nature should also focus on the acquisition of skills in airway management. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigations}} on the accident behaviour of the HTR-Modul was an assessment of expected risk. In addition to accidents in which forced cooling of the core is not possible for a prolonged period of time/ a further priority issue was the analysis of event sequences after steam generator leaks. It {{became apparent that the}} accident topology of the HTR-Modul is no longer characterized by failure of the core cooling system, {{as in the case of}} larger plants, since the possible temperature loads on the fuel elements only slightly impair their capacity to retain fission products. This is the characteristic design feature of the modular reactor; due to the coregeometry, power and power density', there is no need for a forced cooling of the core in order to prevent fission product release, even in the long term. In the case of failure of the operational cooling system, the afterheat is passively dissipated via the surface of the reactor pressure vessel to a surface cooling system lining the concrete reactor cell. The reactor pressure vessel and concrete structures are thus protected against excessively high temperatures. The fuel element temperatures reach a maximum of 1100 °C in a pressurized reactor without forced cooling. The temperatures rise to 1000 °C in the top reflector and to 320 °C in the reactor pressure vessel wall; they thus remain below the respective values specified. In the case of a depressurized reactor, the fuel element temperature increases to 510 °C and the vessel temperature to 350 °C, whereas the temperature of the top reflector decreases to 600 °C. An additional failure of the surface cooler essentially affects only the temperatures in the walls of the reactor pressure vessel and reactor cell. The vessel then reaches 600 °C and has to be depressurized. The concrete structures retain enough of their load-carrying capacity to ensure the stability of the vessel. Rupture of the sphere discharge tube was examined in order to comprehensively cover problems of criticality in hypothetical events. A high subcriticality was ascertained even for the most unfavourable rearrangement of the pebble bed. In order to control operational disturbances which would prevent a shutdown of the plant, in all cases scram of the reactor and also of the blower is envisaged for the HTR-Modul. In the case of failure of the steam generator feed together with postulated failure of blower scram, a thermal overloading of the primary circuit is not expected. The heat capacity of the primary circuit components is sufficient to absorb the stored energy of the core without the. vessel temperatures exceedingthe permissible value of 400 °C. If the reactor scram were assumed to fail simultaneously the blower would be endangered in the first instance. Studies on the pressure build-up in the primary circuit in connection with steam generator leaks have revealed that the primary circuit remains completely functional as a barrier for the risk-relevant leak sizes (< IF) even if steam generator depressurization fails. Only if the gas purification plant also fails does the pressure <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> of the primary circuit respond with a filtered release of the activity to the environment. If the steam generator is properly depressurized, the valve responds only once, releasing about 10...|$|E

Currently, two important issues are functional lifetime and non-controlled drug diffusion. In this work, we present a {{drug delivery}} device combining an electrolytic pump and a thermo-responsive valve, which are both remotely controlled by an electromagnetic field (40. 5 [*]mT and 450 [*]kHz). Our proposed device exhibits a novel operation mechanism for long-term therapeutic treatments using a solid drug in reservoir approach. Our device also prevents undesired drug liquid diffusions. When the electromagnetic field is on, the electrolysis-induced bubble drives the drug liquid towards the Poly (N-Isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) valve that consists of PNIPAM and iron micro-particles. The heat generated by the iron micro-particles causes the PNIPAM to shrink, resulting in an open valve. When the electromagnetic field is turned off, the PNIPAM starts to swell. In the meantime, the bubbles are catalytically recombined into water, reducing the pressure inside the pumping chamber, {{which leads to the}} refilling of the fresh liquid from outside the device.

We thus analyzed the effects of in situ injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and of mesenchymal stem cells on the outcome of xenogenic decellularized scaffolds in a lamb model. MethodsDecellularized porcine pulmonary valves were implanted in the pulmonary artery under cardiopulmonary bypass in 14 lambs after injection in the scaffold of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) group (n = 7) or of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) group (n = 7). At 4 months, valve function was evaluated by echocardiography, and valves were explanted for macroscopic and histologic analysis. ResultsMean transvalvular and distal gradients (millimeters of mercury) were lower in the MSC than those in the BMMC group (1. 3 ± 0. 39 vs 4. 24 ± 0. 91 and 4. 05 ± 1. 89 vs 12. 02 ± 6. 95, respectively; P <. 02).
