5000|$|A typical {{business}} cycle {{plays out in}} the following way. [...] Starting from {{some point in the}} {{business cycle}}, some group (consumers, government, purchasers of exports, etc.) decides for some reason to have a sustained increase in their spending. This may {{come as a surprise to}} producers, who initially experience negative inventory investment as their sales have unexpectedly exceeded their production. Now their inventories are too low, for two reasons: (1) Inventories have accidentally gone down, and (2) the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> - what producers want to have on hand - has gone up because sustained customer demand has gone up and there is increased danger of temporary stock-outs. In order to build inventories up to an appropriate level, firms engage in positive intended inventory investment. This positive flow of intended inventory investment continues until the target <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is reached. During this time, the economy is in a boom both due to the original sustained increase in spending and due to the positive flow of intended inventory investment.|$|E
50|$|At some point, {{there is}} a {{sustained}} decline in some type of spending for some reason. (One reason may simply be that, once inventories reach their desired level, there stops being positive intended inventory investment; {{but there may be}} other reasons as well.) Then there is positive unintended inventory investment as firms are caught by surprise by the external drop in demand and they fail to simultaneously lower their production. Now inventories are too high, for two reasons: (1) They have accidentally risen, and (2) the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is lower now due to the new, lower level of sustained demand. So in order to lower their inventories, firms deliberately cut back their production to below the level of demand by their customers, thus causing inventories to be deliberately drawn down - that is, intended inventory investment is negative. Intended inventory investment remains negative until the target <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is reached. During this time, the economy, having peaked out, is in a downturn (a recession) both due to the sustained decrease in non-inventory expenditure and due to the negative flow of intended inventory investment.|$|E

50|$|A {{positive}} flow of intended {{inventory investment}} {{occurs when a}} firm expects that sales will be high enough that the current <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> on hand may be insufficient - perhaps because {{in the presence of}} very short-term fluctuations in the timing of customer purchases, there is a risk of temporarily being unable to supply the product when a customer demands it. To avoid that prospect, the firm deliberately builds up its inventories - that is, engages in positive intended inventory investment by deliberately producing more than it expects to sell. Economists view this positive intended inventory investment as a form of spending - in effect, the firm is buying inventories from itself.|$|E
5000|$|In JIC, {{manufacturers}} need {{to maintain}} large inventories of supplies, parts, warehousing resources, and extra workers to meet production contingencies. These contingencies, more common in less industrialized countries, can be poor transportation infrastructure, poor quality control, vulnerability to other suppliers' production problems, and natural disasters. These supply-chain instabilities could lead to costly production inefficiencies therefore a manufacturer may maintain and pay for excess inventory and backups of [...] "fragile" [...] production stages which {{could get out of}} sync, cause production shutdowns, or create supply-chain delays for other manufacturers. In JIC, manufacturers reorder stock before it reaches the buffer level or minimum level to allow themselves to have inventories to be sold while the suppliers are supplying the goods. This time range from the time the firm reorders the stock to the time the supplier provides the new stock is known as lead time. Thus a JIC inventory system tries to keep a minimum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> just in case of emergencies, hence the name [...] "Just In Case". One major reason for practicing a more costly JIC system are the potential losses paid (i.e. permanent loss of major customers, loss of suppliers, supply-chain collapse) if supply-chain shocks occur on several occasions. If the JIT response contingencies are too slow or fail to keep production flowing additional costs may be incurred. Under these circumstances the additional costs due to maintaining extra storage, resources, and system resiliency may potentially be more cost effective than using a more efficient JIT system. A JIC examples of buyers would be the military or hospitals who {{need to maintain}} large inventories because waiting for JIT producers to ramp up production for needed supplies may result in losses (i.e. wars, lives).|$|E

40|$|The {{flexible}} accelerator {{concept has}} provided {{the rationale for the}} regression equations used in several recent econometric studies of inventory behavior. In such a model a desired (or equilibrium) <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is defined, but because of costs involved in changing the level of stocks only a partial adjustment of inventories to their desired level is achieved in any time period. This leads to the familiar decision rule in which current inventory is a linear function of the previous period 2 ̆ 7 s stock plus a variable or set of variables representing current demand. The purpose of this note is to question whether there are any significant costs specifically associated with changing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> other than those directly associated with changes in the level of production which may (or may not) be required to bring about the necessary stock adjustment.

40|$|Cyclical contractions {{are often}} {{referred}} to as inventory cycles, in part because movements in inventories can amplify cyclical fluctuations in output. An unanticipated slowing in demand generally leads to an unintended buildup of inventories: only with a lag do firms adjust production and their actual holding of inventories relative to the desired level. A possible explanation for this accumulation is that the costs of adjusting inventory holdings outweigh the disequilibrium costs, i. e., the cost of temporarily deviating from the equilibrium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories.</b> In this paper, the relative importance of the disequilibrium costs to adjustment costs of inventories is evaluated. An estimate of the rate of inventory adjustment towards its long-run equilibrium level is provided in the United States by means of a linear-quadratic model with integrated processes. A limited-information approach allows the time-series properties of the data to be exploited and consistent estimates of the structural parameters of the Euler equation obtained. Evidence is provided that the actual level of U. S. inventories was generally above the target level during the past six recession periods and that inventories fell below their desired level following an economic downturn. Furthermore, the actual <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> appears to have been at desired levels between the 1960 and the 1969 - 70 recessions and since the last recession in 1990 ­ 1991 [...] two periods of sustained economic growth. These findings support the view that inventory imbalances can amplify the business cycle. The empirical estimates also imply that adjustment costs are substantially more important than disequilibrium costs. The estimate of the speed of adjustment suggests that firms adjust their holdings of inventories slowly as it takes about a year for 95 per cent of the adjustment of the actual level to the target level to be completed.

40|$|Abstract Product {{inventory}} exerts two countervailing {{forces on}} the probability <b>of</b> purchase: More <b>inventory</b> on hand reduces the need to purchase; however, theory suggests higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> can drive up consumption, thereby increasing the chance of purchase. Moreover, consumers have biased estimations of their own inventory—especially at high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> (Chandon and Wansink, 2006), which again suggests {{a positive relationship between}} inventory and purchase probability. We model the negative (standard) and positive effects <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> on the probability of purchase. The model is calibrated on ten product categories and fits better than the standard nested logit and an alternative developed by Ailawadi and Neslin (1998). The elasticity of purchase incidence with respect to inventory represents these opposing forces in an intuitive way, implying an inventory threshold below (above) which the net effect is positive (negative).

40|$|Behavioral {{studies and}} recent {{empirical}} research suggest higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> on hand can lead consumers to increase consumption. Inventory on hand is therefore posited to exert two countervailing {{forces on the}} probability of purchase incidence. First, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> {{reduce the likelihood of}} purchase as the consumer feels less pressure to buy. At the same time however, theory suggests higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> may drive up the rate of consumption, thereby increasing the probability of incidence. We develop an empirical model that explicitly captures these two effects. The elasticity of purchase incidence with respect to inventory derived from the model is shown to capture these opposing forces in a simple and intuitive way. The analytical expression allows calculation of a threshold below (above) which the net effect is positive (negative). The model is estimated on ten product categories from the Stanford Market Basket database and is shown to fit better than both the standard nested logit approach and an alternative formulation developed by Ailawadi and Neslin (1998). The threshold values have plausible magnitudes and are intuitive across categories: butter, margarine and crackers have relatively low thresholds implying that inventory build up does not drive consumption; ice cream and soft drinks have relatively large thresholds (below which the inventory pressure to consume more outweighs the effect to delay purchase). Implications for retail management are discussed. [...] Choice Models,Consumption,Inventory,Purchase Incidence...|$|R
40|$|An {{otherwise}} conventional Keynesian macro {{model is}} modified to include inventories of final goods by (1) drawing a distinction between production and final sales, and (2) allowing for a negative effect of the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> on production.

The model successfully explains two inventory facts; (i) inventory investment is procyclical, and (ii) production is more volatile than sales. The key intuition is that, since inventories and demand are complements in generating sales, the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is increasing in expected demand. Thus, when demand {{is expected to be}} strong, firms increase their production not only to meet their demand but also to accumulate inventories. Also, our model shows that the inventory to sales ratio is persistent and countercyclical, while the (endogenous) markup is countercyclical.
