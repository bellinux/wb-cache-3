5|$|After Passover, {{the celebration}} of Mimouna takes place, a {{tradition}} brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy. Most notably, the first <b>leaven</b> after Passover, a thin crepe called a mofletta, eaten with honey, syrup or jam, is served. The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.|$|E
5|$|The week-long holiday of Passover in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives, travelling, and {{on the first night}} of Passover, the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– <b>leaven</b> or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E

5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to <b>leaven</b> bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, fungi {{have been used}} {{for a wide variety of}} {{industrial}} fermentations, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue jeans. Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including amylases, invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha-glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to <b>leaven</b> bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Church of the East uses leavened {{bread for}} Eucharist, like most churches of Eastern Christianity, {{but it is}} the only Church to include the {{additional}} ingredient of Holy <b>Leaven.</b> Holy <b>Leaven</b> is a powder added to sacramental bread before it is baked. Despite the name, Holy <b>Leaven</b> does not actually contain a leavening agent. Instead, khmira, fermented dough from previously used sacramental bread, is added and acts as <b>leaven.</b> What the Holy <b>Leaven</b> does contain is remainder from the original Holy <b>Leaven,</b> renewed annually by mixing it with common ingredients. The original Holy <b>Leaven</b> is said to contain residue from the original bread used at the Last Supper, mixed with the blood of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|The Holy <b>Leaven</b> is {{a sacrament}} in the Assyrian Church of the East {{and no other}} Church recognizes it as a sacrament. With the Holy <b>Leaven</b> and the sacrament of the Sign of the cross, also unique to the Assyrian Church, its number of sacraments total seven. Canon law of the Church says that Holy <b>Leaven</b> must be added to sacramental bread {{for it to be}} consecrated. An Eucharist without the Holy <b>Leaven</b> is invalid.|$|E
25|$|The Holy <b>Leaven</b> is renewed {{annually}} on Maundy Thursday by a bishop by mixing {{some of the}} old Holy <b>Leaven</b> with a new mix. The mix consists of fine wheaten flour, salt, olive oil, and water. There are many prayers associated with the renewal of the Holy <b>Leaven.</b> The newly renewed Holy <b>Leaven</b> is then distributed to each parish of his diocese to be used for sacramental bread baked by priests for the year to come.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Holy <b>Leaven</b> {{could have}} functioned {{much the same}} way as the Catholic fermentum – {{particles}} of Eucharistic bread carried from one diocese to another in Roman Rite to unite Eucharistic services with the one presided over by the Pope. In other words, the addition of the Holy <b>Leaven</b> materially connects each Eucharist celebrated in the Assyrian Church of the East to the original Last Supper. Likewise, the Holy <b>Leaven</b> is similar to Holy anointing oil, which is renewed from the oil of the horn, that the Church believes is inherited from John the Baptist.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} historical {{mention of}} the Holy <b>Leaven</b> is from c. 900, and tradition that connects it with the Last Supper is fairly new, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries.

25|$|The Holy <b>Leaven</b> {{serves as}} a {{connection}} between the Last Supper and each Eucharist. This has special importance in the Liturgy of Addai and Mari used by the Assyrian Church, which does not recount the Words of Institution that echo the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper. As such, the Holy <b>Leaven</b> serves as material link in lieu of words.|$|E

50|$|Chemical <b>leavens</b> are {{mixtures}} or {{compounds that}} release gases when they react with each other, with moisture, or with heat.

Chemical <b>leavens</b> are used in quick breads and cakes, as well as cookies and numerous other applications where a long biological fermentation is impractical or undesirable.|$|R

25|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that if the}} 14th of Nisan falls on the Sabbath, Rabbi Meir taught that one must destroy <b>leaven</b> before the Sabbath (except for that required {{for the beginning of}} the Sabbath itself). But the Sages maintained that one destroys the <b>leaven</b> at its usual time (on the morning of the 14th). Rabbi Eleazar bar Zadok taught that one had to destroy consecrated meat before the Sabbath (because if any was left, none could eat it), and unconsecrated food at its usual time (because one could easily find eaters for it). The Mishnah taught that those on the way to perform religious duties who recollect <b>leaven</b> at home, if they are able to go back, destroy it, and then return to the religious duty, must go back and destroy it. But if they cannot, then they annul it in their heart. Similarly, those on the way to save people from an emergency annul it in their heart. But those on their way to appoint a Sabbath station to set the limits of where they may travel on the Sabbath must return immediately to destroy the <b>leaven.</b> Similarly, those who left Jerusalem and recollected that they had consecrated meat with them, if they had passed Mount Scopus, they burned it where they were. But if they had not traveled that far, they returned and burned {{it in front of the}} Temple with the wood arranged for use in the altar. The Mishnah then discussed for what quantity they had to return. Rabbi Meir said for both <b>leaven</b> and consecrated meat, they had to return for a quantity as much as an egg. Rabbi Judah said when there was as much as an olive. But the Sages ruled that for consecrated meat, they had to return for as much as an olive; while for <b>leaven,</b> they had to return for as much as an egg.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{origins of}} the Holy <b>Leaven</b> are unknown, as is the time the rituals were first performed. Nonetheless, different versions of tradition about its origins exist. In any case, the traditions are fairly young, dating to 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{exclusion}} of <b>leaven</b> {{from the home}} has forced Jewish cooks to be creative, producing {{a wide variety of}} Passover dishes that use matzo meal and potato as thickeners. Potato flour is largely used in cakes along with finely ground matzo meal and nuts.|$|E
25|$|The {{anaphora}} (Eucharistic prayer) of the Assyrian Church of the East – {{included in}} its Liturgy of Addai and Mari – {{does not contain}} the Words of Institution that recount Jesus' words at the Last Supper.
