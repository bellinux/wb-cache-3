40|$|Abstract. In this {{technical}} paper, the microstructure, hardness, tensile deforma-tion {{and final}} fracture behaviour {{of an emerging}} titanium alloy for performance-critical applications are presented and discussed. Both <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were prepared from the as-provided sheet stock of the alloy and deformed in uniaxial tension. The yield strength and tensile strength of the alloy sheet in the transverse orientation was higher than the longitudinal orientation. The ductility of the <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> quantified in terms of reduction-in-cross-sectional area, was higher for the transverse specimen {{when compared to the}} longitudinal counterpart. The elongation-to-failure of the <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> was identical in the two orientations of the sheet stock. The tensile fracture behaviour of the alloy was quantified by careful examination of the fracture surfaces in a scanning electron microscope. The intrinsic fracture features on the tensile fracture surface were dis-cussed taking into consideration the nature of loading and contribution from intrin-sic microstructural features...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{describe}} fatigue testing by means of miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Special miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> fixtures were designed and manufactured {{for the purposes of}} fatigue testing at the Zwick/Roell - Amsler 10 HPF 5100 test machine. The miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were produced of the traditional <b>test</b> <b>specimens.</b> Seven different steels and an Al-alloy were fatigue loaded (R = 0. 1) at room temperature. Findings: The paper describes the results of fatigue tests performed on miniature <b>tests</b> <b>specimens</b> in comparison with traditional fatigue tests for several steels (and one Al-alloy) applied in power producing industry. Research limitations/implications: At present, questions on quantitative evaluation of remaining lifetime become urgent and because fatigue is the most frequent cause of materials degradation and resulting structural components failures, the most important means of remaining lifetime assessment is the evaluation of fatigue properties before and after some time of service. Originality/value: The original material data are usually tested by means of classic <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> which can be hardly used in case of components in service, where there is no possibility to withdraw sufficient volume of representative material for the classic <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> manufacturing. In such cases today, new modern methods of semi-destructive removal of a small volume of test material by grinding or an electro-discharge are utilized. This makes it possible to produce a miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{the design}} of {{on-shore}} pipelines installed {{in areas that are}} susceptible to ground movements and offshore pipelines, axial stresses above yield must be considered. In such so-called strain-based design, knowledge of the stress-strain behaviour of the pipeline steel and girth welds is highly important.

As regards the geometry, it is concluded that the stress-strain diagram is most representative for a flat fullthickness <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> As regards the orientation, the yield stress is higher for transversal <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> as compared to longitudinally oriented <b>test</b> <b>specimens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Miniaturised <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> {{are often}} used for the tensile testing of {{cellulose}} nanopapers as there are currently no standardised test geometries to evaluate their tensile properties. In this work, we report the influence of <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries on the measured tensile properties of plant-derived cellulose nanofibres (CNF) and microbially synthesised bacterial cellulose (BC) nanopapers. Four <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries were studied: (i) miniaturised dog bone specimen with 2 mm width, (ii) miniaturised rectangular specimen with 5 mm width, (iii) standard dog bone specimen with 5 mm width and (iv) standard rectangular specimen with 15 mm width. It {{was found that the}} tensile moduli of both CNF and BC nanopapers were not significantly influenced by the <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries if an independent strain measurement system (video extensometer) was employed. The average tensile strength of the cellulose nanopapers is also influenced by <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries. It was observed that the smaller the <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> width, the higher the average tensile strength of the cellulose nanopapers. This can be described by the weakest link theory, whereby the probability of defects present in the cellulose nanopapers increases with increasing <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> width.

40|$|Double-torsion {{tests were}} carried out to {{ascertain}} whether a thin <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> would affect {{the results of this}} test. The tests involved two <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> sizes, one with a thickness five-fold greater than the particle size of the material and the other with a three-fold greater thickness. The width of both <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> was ten times that of their thickness and their length was double their width. The material utilized was an alumina-based refractory castable without cement. It is important to ascertain the influence of the thickness of double-torsion <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> when materials with a coarse microstructure are involved.

However, the analysis of the mean values of R (R), obtained by the arithmetic average of the R values in the section of stable crack propagation and the total fracture energy (&# 947;wof), showed that these values are dependent on the size of the <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> indicating that this subject deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies on}} {{acoustic}} emission characteristics of cemented waste of rock backfills with two different structures during creep process {{were carried out}} by virtue of short-term creep test under different stress levels. The results show that: When {{two parts of the}} stone combinations in the <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> are combined in a minor angle (30 °~ 60 °) (type I), under sustained loading without failure, acoustic emission amplitude will increase during steady creep stage with surface crack opening and propagating. When two parts of the stone combinations in the <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> are combined in a large angle (60 °~ 90 °) (type II), under sustained loading without failure, the <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> show two varied features. On one hand, acoustic emission amplitude will decrease significantly during steady creep stage, with surface crack opening and propagating which will mainly occur during decelerated creep stage. On the other hand, acoustic emission amplitude is rather fluctuating during sustained load stage which leads to separation and drop of parts of the <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> One common trait of these two types of <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> is that, the whole decelerated creep and steady creep stages show relatively stable acoustic emission amplitude before destruction.

Both quasi-static indentation and drop-weight impact tests {{were used to}} investigate the impact behavior at two nominal energy levels (5. 5 and 8. 4 J) and determine the onset of internal damage. Through x-ray inspection, the extent of internal damage was characterized non-destructively. The composite strength and constant amplitude fatigue response were evaluated to assess {{the effects of the}} sustained damage. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize internal damage from impact in comparison to damage that occurs during mechanical loading alone. The effect of stacking sequence was examined by using specimens with the long dimension of the specimen both parallel (longitudinal) and perpendicular (transverse) to the 0 deg fiber direction. Damage in the form of longitudinal and transverse cracking occurred in all <b>longitudinal</b> <b>specimens</b> <b>tested</b> at energies greater than 6. 3 J. Similar results occurred in the transverse <b>specimens</b> <b>tested</b> above 5. 4 J. Initial load drop, characteristic of the onset of damage, occurred on average at 6. 3 J in longitudinal specimens and at 5. 0 J in transverse specimens. X-ray analysis showed broken fibers in the impacted region in <b>specimens</b> <b>tested</b> at the higher impact energies. At low impact energies, visible matrix cracking may occur, but broken fibers may not. Matrix cracking was noted along fiber swims and it appeared to depend on the surface quality of composite.

The most important advantage of these method is the nearly non-destructive withdrawal of test material and small size of <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> what is interesting in cases of remaining lifetime assessment when a sufficient volume of the representative material cannot be withdrawn of the component in question. In opposite, the most important disadvantage of such methods stems from the necessity to correlate test results with the results of classical test procedures and to build up a database of material data in service. The correlations among the miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> data and the results of classical tensile tests, fracture toughnesss values and time to rupture characteristics at creep temperatures and, of course fatigue S – N curves are necessary for the remainig lifetime {{assessment of}} structure in long-time service. The paper describes the results of fatigue tests performed on miniature <b>tests</b> <b>specimens</b> in comparison with classical fatigue tests for several steels applied in power producing industry. Special miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> fixture was designed and manufactured for the purposes of fatigue testing at the Zwick/Roell – Amsler 10 HPF 5100 test machine. The miniature <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were produced by water-jet cutting from the large <b>test</b> <b>specimens.</b> With respect to the specimen shape (See Figure), stress concentration and multiaxial stress situation had to be taken into consideration for the purposes of comparison with the classical <b>test</b> <b>specimens...</b>|$|R
