5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded a <b>little</b> <b>by</b> {{two other}} ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he could gain <b>little</b> <b>by</b> {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E

In August, the band {{announced}} they would be recording in a few weeks' time, and were aiming for a spring 2011 release. After some shows in the summer, the band began recording in October. Eric Valentine produced the sessions at Barefoot Recording in Hollywood, California. Valentine also engineered the sessions with assistance from Cian Riordan. The band used Undertone Audio Consoles during recording. At the start of recording, the group had 18 songs. They whittled this number down <b>little</b> <b>by</b> little, and wrote additional songs at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The drums tracks were completed in early October.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively <b>little</b> <b>by</b> erosion from water.|$|E

25|$|As news {{announcements}} {{spread and}} suspects were searched in surrounding counties, the fear crossed over {{to many other}} cities, including Hope, Lufkin and Magnolia, even going as far as Oklahoma City.
