5|$|A local landowner, E. D. Till, leased {{the castle}} in 1897 and {{undertook}} restoration work. Agnes Lady Fountain {{took over the}} lease {{after his death in}} 1917. She agreed to a plan to protect the castle, under which she purchased the freehold and transferred this to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1937; then, once the <b>leasehold</b> on the property had expired, the castle was passed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1948.|$|E
5|$|As the 999-year <b>leasehold</b> {{building}} has been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for architectural conservation, {{the new owner}} was asked to preserve the building's façade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out on the building from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles.|$|E

5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully surveyed by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back <b>leasehold</b> properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town houses that had been built up to the edge of the site.|$|E
5|$|The house {{which forms}} the {{architectural}} {{core of the}} palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 {{to the design of}} William Winde. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings. Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's natural son, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to GeorgeIII for £21,000. Sheffield's <b>leasehold</b> on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his <b>leasehold</b> interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E

40|$|For {{property}} law, {{the system}} of estates represents the most obvious of many links between past and present. The very word “estate”, drawn from and implying status, signifies the feudal origins of the system. So does the distinction, still current, between freehold and nonfreehold estates- the first referring to normal tenures of feudal times, the second to mere leases. <b>Leaseholds</b> – or nonfreeholds or tenancies- {{are a part of}} the larger estates system. Like the freehold estates, <b>leaseholds</b> have roots that run deep into feudal times (hence the notion of a tenant who holds under a landlord). And again like freeholds, <b>leaseholds</b> have been fairly static over the years in term of their formal characteristics. In terms of relations between landlord and tenant, however, there have been regular and significant developments. The most important of these, together with the body of conventional American law in the background, make up the bulk of this paperwork. The article considers the incidents of <b>leaseholds</b> and then concludes with a selective look at the persistent problem of affordable rental housing...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm <b>leasehold.</b> In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase its land along with the 620 N.
