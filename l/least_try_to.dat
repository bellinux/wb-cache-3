5|$|The group {{discovers that}} the generator's fuel {{reserves}} are near exhausted; when empty, the facility will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed {{to destroy the}} facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner open the doors, and Rick eventually convinces him {{to allow them to}} at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> overcome the tragedy rather than be forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction. The surviving members return to their vehicles and set off away from the smoking husk of the CDC.|$|E

He had no faith in the Weygand plan nor in the {{proposal}} of the latter to at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a Réduit de Flandres. The ports needed to supply such a foothold were already threatened. That day, the 2nd Panzer Division assaulted Boulogne and 10th Panzer assaulted Calais. The British garrison in Boulogne surrendered on 25 May although 4,368 troops were evacuated. Calais, though strengthened by the arrival of 3rd Royal Tank Regiment equipped with cruiser tanks and 30th Motor Brigade, fell to the Germans on 27 May.|$|E

25|$|If a firstborn {{attending}} a siyum does {{not hear the}} completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast (Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p.168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p.99). Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky). The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal.|$|E

She says that Hamilton is understandably angry at the corporate lobbyists who have encouraged climate change denial.

"Clean, Clean" [...] is the album's fifth track, {{and follows}} {{the story of}} a young boy who grows out of being a gangster, and, despite not willing to do so, he will at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep the {{fighting}} clean. Wave Maker Magazine found [...] "Elstree," [...] the album's sixth song, as lyrically similar to [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star," [...] as it follows [...] "a failed actor taking up a more regular position behind the scenes and looking back at his life in regret." [...] The slow-tempo ballad [...] "Astroboy (And the Proles on Parade)", according to Wave Maker, [...] "once again revisits cyberpunk with a much lighter vibe, although the keyboards do occasionally border darker realms, expecially with the post-chorus hook," [...] and the album closer [...] "Johnny on the Monorail" [...] has a [...] "pop atmosphere" [...] that [...] "better suits the flow of the rest of the album." ...|$|E

500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I wonder if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E

[...] She also added: [...] "I loved seeing Cristina at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stand by her man." [...] Of Yang and Owen's wedding, Armstrong said: [...] "Glad {{we made a}} clean disposal of the Teddy-Owen-Cristina love triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, [...] "I heard there's a guy," [...] {{and she said she}} was happy for him." [...] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an [...] "A". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: [...] "I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now? Just growing up? Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I can’t get enough." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Creep" [...] has {{not only}} been covered, {{it has also been}} sampled and recreated by many hip-hop and R artists. Two of the notable ones were {{released}} on SoundCloud in 2013 and gained many attention from the public are Haitian-Canadian record producer Kaytranada's remix of the song called [...] "Kaytranada's Creepier Edition" [...] in January and GoldLink's own rap rendition in December. Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record she loved it! Hopefully the fans will too!," [...] Bellinger said in a statement sent to MTV News. In the track, its new content finds Bellinger making promises to never cheat on his lover. The original [...] "Creep" [...] also made its appearance on The Game's [...] "Sex Skit" [...] from his album The Documentary 2.5, released in October 2015. In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it. And that's kind of what I think made me want to record it. That was literally the first thing I heard was 'Do do, do,' , and I was like, 'Oh, yes. Yes, please.'," [...] she shared. Watkins had also confirmed to have a cameo on its music video that hasn't yet been released.|$|E

2500|$|Writing to Piave, Verdi made {{it clear}} how {{important}} this subject was to him: [...] "....This tragedy {{is one of the}} greatest creations of man... If we can't make something great out of it let us at <b>least</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do something out of the ordinary". [...] In spite of disagreements and Verdi's need to constantly bully Piave into correcting his drafts (to the point where Maffei had a hand in re-writing some scenes of the libretto, especially the witches' chorus in Act 3 and the sleepwalking scene), their version follows Shakespeare's play quite closely, but with some changes. [...] Instead of using three witches as in the play, there is a large female chorus of witches, singing in three part harmony (though it should be noted that they are divided in three groups, and that every group sings as a single witch, using [...] "I" [...] and not [...] "we"). The last act begins with an assembly of refugees on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating victory over the tyrant.|$|E

60|$|Oh be {{at least}} able to say in that day,--Lord, I am no hero. I have been careless, cowardly, {{sometimes}} all but mutinous. Punishment I have deserved, I deny it not.

Pardon my faults, out of Thine own boundless pity for human weakness. Strike not my unworthy name off the roll-call of the noble and victorious army, which is the blessed company of all faithful people; and let me, too, be found written in the Book of Life: even though I stand the lowest and last upon its list.
