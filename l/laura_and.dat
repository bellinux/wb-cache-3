5|$|Austin and Laura {{married in}} 1896; L. D. was born {{around the next}} year. (L. D. was {{regularly}} referred to after the lynching as L.W. or Lawrence.) In 1900 the extended family moved to Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. According to Jones-Sneed, <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> Austin were listed in the 1910 census as having two children, L. D., aged 13, and Carrie, aged two. It is not known what became of Carrie. She {{may have been the}} baby one witness said survived the lynching.|$|E

5|$|L. D. {{had shot}} and killed Okemah's deputy sheriff, George Loney, on May 2, 1911, while Loney and a posse were searching the Nelsons' farm for a stolen cow. L. D. and Laura were both charged with murder, in Laura's case {{because she had been}} the first to grab the gun. Her husband, Austin, pleaded guilty to larceny and was sent to the {{relative}} safety of the state prison in McAlester. <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> L.D. were held in the Okemah county jail, possibly along with Laura's baby, to await trial.|$|E
5|$|<b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it {{through the front door}} of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E

When she sees more omens {{she begins to}} get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This turns out to be another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling {{that things are going}} nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E
5|$|Marianne {{moved in}} with Pontecorvo at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panthéon on 4 January 1938. Their son Gil was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, {{and she had to}} return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo {{accompanied}} her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of the Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, <b>Laura</b> <b>and</b> Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.|$|E
