5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, <b>lignocellulose</b> polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E

Wood preservation is able to lengthen its life {{at least three times}} than non-treated wood. <b>Lignocelluloses</b> biomass bio-oil is potential substrates as wood preservative. One of potential source as <b>lignocelluloses</b> biomass bio-oil is oil palm trunk. Production of <b>lignocelluloses</b> biomass bio-oil is influenced by numerous parameters such as, moisture content of wood, temperature and time of combustion.

In this dissertation, the adsorption concept was considered to separate <b>lignocelluloses</b> from the spent liquors (SL) s of TMP and NSSC processes. Various adsorbents such as activated carbon, fly ash, bentonite, kaolin, kaolinite, calcium carbonate, talc and aluminium silicate were used in order to adsorb <b>lignocelluloses.</b> The operating conditions of adsorption were optimized by adjusting pH, temperature and time of treatment. Moreover, various alternatives, such as pH adjustment, polymer addition and multi-stage adsorption processes were considered to improve the overall extraction of <b>lignocelluloses</b> from SLs. The properties of adsorbents, e. g. charge density and surface area, {{were related to the}} adsorption performance and the properties, e. g. turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), of SLs after adsorption. The high removals in turbidity and COD showed that the suggested processes were not only effective in extracting <b>lignocelluloses</b> but also efficient in decreasing the load of wastewater treatment of the plant.
