25|$|Many 2010-era digital delays {{present an}} {{extensive}} array of options, including a {{control over the}} time before playback of the delayed signal. Most also allow the user to select the overall level of the processed signal {{in relation to the}} unmodified one, or the level at which the delayed signal is fed back into the buffer, to be repeated again. Some systems in the 2010s allow more exotic controls, such as the ability to add an audio filter, or to play back the buffer's contents in reverse. As digital memory became cheaper in the 1980s, units like Lexicon PCM42, Roland SDE-3000, TC Electronic 2290 offered above 3 seconds delay time, enough to create background loops, rhythms and phrases. The 2290 was upgradeable to 32 seconds and Electro-Harmonix offered a 16-second delay and <b>looping</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Their {{style of}} music is often {{referred}} to as [...] "quirky folk", which incorporates acoustic instrumentation including banjo, guitar, upright bass, mandolin, ukelele, glockenspiel, djembe, and their signature golden egg. Twin harmonies layered on top of acoustic instrumentation are coupled with Laurie’s beatboxing and inventive use of a <b>looping</b> <b>machine,</b> and Katelyn’s repurposed telephone microphone. The use of electronics set their sound apart, creating an eclectic and eccentric blend of folk, roots, pop and fun. A Shook Twins staple is also the addition of choruses or lines from other contemporary songs (Edward Sharpe in Shook Twins “Toll Free,” for example) to their own songs, remix-style.

50|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive {{digital signal processing}} electronics in the late 1970s and 1980s {{led to the development}} of the first digital delay effects. Initially, they were only available in expensive rack-mounted units but eventually as costs came down and the electronics grew smaller, they became available in the form of foot pedals. The first digital delay offered in a pedal was the Boss DD-2 in 1984. Rack-mounted delay units evolved into digital reverb units and on to digital multi-effects units capable of more sophisticated effects than pure delay, such as reverb and Audio timescale-pitch modification effects. Digital delay systems function by sampling the input signal through an analog-to-digital converter, after which the signal is passed through a series of digital signal processors that record it into a storage buffer, and then play back the stored audio based on parameters set by the user. The delayed ("wet") output may be mixed with the unmodified ("dry") signal after, or before, it is sent to a digital-to-analog converter for output.Many 2010-era digital delays present an extensive array of options, including a control over the time before playback of the delayed signal. Most also allow the user to select the overall level of the processed signal in relation to the unmodified one, or the level at which the delayed signal is fed back into the buffer, to be repeated again.
