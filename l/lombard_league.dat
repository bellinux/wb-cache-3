In an attempt {{to take advantage of}} the revived <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> (an alliance of northern Italian towns) against Frederick II, John went to Bologna. According to a version of Ernoul's chronicle, he declined an offer by the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> representatives to elect him their king. Even though this account was fabricated, John remained in Bologna for over six months. The dying Pope Honorius appointed John rector of a Patrimony of Saint Peter in Tuscany (part of the Papal States) on 27 January 1227, and urged Frederick II to restore him to the throne of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Honorius' successor, Gregory IX, confirmed John's position in the Papal States on 5April and ordered the citizens of Perugia to elect him their podestà.|$|E
5|$|Géza intervened {{at least}} six times in the fights for Kiev on behalf of Iziaslav II of Kiev either by sending {{reinforcements}} or by personally leading his troops to the Kievan Rus' between 1148 and 1155. He also waged wars against the Byzantine Empire {{on behalf of his}} allies, including the Serbs of Rascia, but could not prevent the Byzantines from restoring their suzerainty over them. Conflicts emerged between Géza and his brothers, Stephen and Ladislaus, who fled from Hungary and settled in Emperor Manuel's court in Constantinople. Géza supported Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, against the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> with auxiliary troops between 1158 and 1160. After the cardinals who supported Emperor Frederick I elected Victor IV pope, Géza acknowledged his legitimacy in 1160, but in a year, he changed sides and concluded a concordat with Victor IV's opponent, Pope Alexander III. Before his death, Géza organized a separate appanage duchy for his younger son, Béla.|$|E

25|$|While Frederick and his {{reinforcements}} were {{on their}} way back to Pavia to join the main imperial force, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> placed about 3,500 men near {{the west bank of the}} Olona. The infantry, with the Milanese war cart, the carroccio, stood in a hastily fortified position at Borsano. The Lombards knew that Frederick was about to skirt through their area, but did not realize how close he already was. At dawn on May 29, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> sent a reconnaissance unit of 700 horsemen to the Seprio area. At the same time, the emperor had crossed the Olona and was marching south from Cairate, five miles northeast of Busto Arsizio.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} of the Middle Ages in Italy was marked by {{frequent}} conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy, the latter eventually emerging victorious in that it ultimately prevented political unification of northern Italy under Imperial rule. Imperial invasions were led by more or less all medieval Emperors, the most notable episodes being the end of the Investiture controversy by the pilgrimage of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor at Canossa in 1077 and the no less than five major invasions staged by Frederick Barbarossa against the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League,</b> culminating in the sack of Milan in 1162, after which every building in the city was demolished, except the churches. The lasting conflict led to the emergence of the Guelph and the Ghibelline parties in northern Italy, supporting respectively the Pope (and the independent cities) and the Emperor, though siding with a party was often dictated by other political considerations (more or less each city has belonged to both parties). In May 1176, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League,</b> led by a revived Milan, defeated the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Legnano.|$|E
50|$|For the 1996 general {{election}} the party {{joined forces with}} Autonomy Lombard Alliance (a 1989 split from Lega Lombarda, led by Angela Bossi and Pierangelo Brivio, sister and brother-in-law of Umberto Bossi respectively), forming the <b>Lombard</b> Autonomy <b>League.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1162, Imperial and Cremonese forces {{assaulted}} Milan {{and destroyed}} it. However, in 1167 the city changed sides {{and joined the}} <b>Lombard</b> <b>League.</b> Its troops {{were part of the}} army that, on 29 May 1176, defeated Barbarossa in the Battle of Legnano. However, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> did not survive this victory for long. In 1213, at Castelleone, the Cremonese defeated the League of Milan, Lodi, Crema, Novara, Como and Brescia. In 1232, Cremona allied itself with Emperor Frederick II, who was again trying to reassert the Empire's authority over Northern Italy. In the Battle of Cortenuova, the Cremonese were on the winning side. Thereafter Frederick often held his court in the city. In the Battle of Parma, however, the Ghibellines suffered a heavy defeat and up to two thousand Cremonese were made prisoners. Some year later Cremona took its vengeance by defeating Parma's army. Its army, under the command of Umberto Pallavicino, captured Parma's carroccio and for centuries kept the enemy's trousers hanging from the Cathedral's ceiling {{as a sign of the}} rival's humiliation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1249, a Guelph Romagnol army of the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> {{advanced}} to the Panaro.

The army was led by the Brescian Filippo Ugoni, who had victoriously defended Milan while besieged by Emperor Frederick II, and accompanied by Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, the Cardinal of Bologna.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} years {{led to an}} estrangement between Barbarossa and Henry. Henry ceased to support the Emperor's Italy campaigns, which were all proven unsuccessful, as massively as he used to, and instead focused on his own possessions. In 1175 Barbarossa again asked for support against the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League,</b> which Henry {{is said to have}} refused bluntly, even though Barbarossa kneeled before him. Records of this event were not written until several years later, and sources are contradictory, depending on whom the author favoured. Nevertheless, lacking the support of the Saxons the following Battle of Legnano was a complete failure for the Emperor.|$|E

50|$|In the 10th century Lombardy, {{formally}} {{under the}} rule of the Holy Roman Empire, like much of central-northern Italy, was in fact divided in a multiplicity of small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes. The 11th century marked a significant boom in the region's economy, due to improved trading and, mostly, agricultural conditions, with arms manufacture a significant factor. In a similar way to other areas of Italy, this led to a growing self-acknowledgement of the cities, whose increasing richness made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local legates. This process reached its apex in the 12th and 13th centuries, when different <b>Lombard</b> <b>Leagues</b> formed by allied cities of Lombardy, usually led by Milan, managed to defeat the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I, at Legnano, and his grandson Frederick II, at Parma. Subsequently, among the various local city-states, a process of consolidation took place, {{and by the end of}} the 14th century, two signorias emerged as rival hegemons in Lombardy: Milan and Mantua.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Foundation and {{formation}} of Lega Nord=== Lega Lombarda was officially founded on 12 April 1984 by Umberto Bossi, {{who used the}} resonance {{of the name of}} the historical Lega Lombarda when choosing the name. Originally Lega Autonomista Lombarda (<b>Lombard</b> Autonomist <b>League,</b> LAL), the party took the current name in 1986. At its electoral debut in the 1987 general election, Lega Lombarda gained 2.6% of the vote in Lombardy. Bossi was elected to the Senate and Giuseppe Leoni to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|R
25|$|The {{victory of}} the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> forced Frederick to travel to Venice. In the Peace of Venice, 1177, Frederick and Pope Alexander III were reconciled. The emperor {{acknowledged}} the pope's sovereignty over the Papal States, and in return Alexander acknowledged the emperor's overlordship of the Imperial Church. The Peace of Venice was heavily instigated by Archbishop Wichmann of Magdeburg, who was amongst the defeated at Legnano. The cities of Lombardy, however, continued to fight until 1183, when, in the Peace of Constance, Frederick conceded their right to freely elect town magistrates. The Treaty was cast in bronze.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{the battle}} commenced. The Lombard {{reconnaissance}} {{force and the}} 300 strong Imperial vanguard clashed. The clash was brief and bloody and with Frederick already on the horizon, the Lombard reconnaissance broke off and fled beyond Borsano. At this Frederick and his imperial German army launched a full blooded attack on the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> forces near Borsano – Legnano. The Lombard cavalry was largely routed but managed to escape the skirmish, leaving the infantry and carroccio on its own. Frederick advanced to the carroccio and assaulted the infantry and the Company of Death with his cavalry.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this chaotic era that Italian towns saw {{the rise of a}} {{peculiar}} institution, the medieval commune. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the Holy See, local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order. In 1176 a league of city-states, the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League,</b> defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano, thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities. In coastal and southern areas, the maritime republics, the most notable being Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi, heavily involved in the Crusades, grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the Orient.|$|E
40|$|The Caroccio of Cortenuova Northern and Southern Italy between Papacy and Empire in the Cronaca of Salimbene de Adam Starting from a quote {{in recent}} {{literature}} on the Italian unification, this article attempts to explain {{the role played by}} the Italian Middle Ages in the construction of national memory and in the archeology of a prejudice. It admonishes that only a full recognition of the deep alterity of the Middle Ages can prevent misuses of medieval references. Next, it proceeds to discuss the quote in question, namely a reference to Salimbene de Adam’s well-known chronicle, and it examines what drove this Franciscan chronicler to change the final episode of the Battle of Cortenuova (1237). In his Cronaca Salimbene relates that, after Frederick II had beaten the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League’s</b> army and seized possession of the Carroccio, the symbol of communal autonomy and liberty, he offered it to the city of Rome, which, in turn, burned it. However, a still existing inscription testifies that the Carroccio was not an unwelcome gift for Rome at all. Despite this historical reality, the Franciscan chronicler preferred, as Ludovico Gatto has suggested, to present posterity with the image of a defiant Rome towards Frederick II, who was identified after all, in the Joachimite literature, as the Antichrist, the enemy of Christianity. </p...|$|R

Whether the trade of the East was to go up the Adriatic, or round by the Gulf of Genoa, was essentially a mercantile question; but whether, of the two ports in sight of each other, Pisa or Genoa was to be the Queen of the Tyrrhene Sea, was no less distinctly a personal one than which of two rival beauties shall preside at a tournament.|$|R
25|$|Henry {{entered into}} further {{negotiations}} with the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> cities and with Pope Celestine III on his Imperial coronation, and ceded Tusculum to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in Rome, Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in Apulia and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's liensman Margaritus of Brindisi came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's Pisan navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving Genoese contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege.

500|$|Géza's {{youngest}} brother, Stephen, started conspiring {{with their}} uncle, Beloš, and other lords against Géza, {{according to the}} nearly contemporaneous Rahewin. To avoid a civil war, Géza first ordered the persecution of Stephen's partisans, then had his rebellious brother expelled from the kingdom and even sentenced to death. Niketas Choniates also recorded that Stephen had been [...] "forced to flee from the murderous clutches" [...] of Géza. Géza's uncle, Beloš, was not mentioned in royal charters issued after March 1157, which suggest that he left Hungary after that date. During the summer of that year, Stephen fled to the Holy Roman Empire, seeking Emperor Frederick's protection against Géza. Upon the emperor's demand, Géza accepted Frederick Barbarossa as arbitrator in his conflict with Stephen and sent his envoys to Regensburg in January 1158. However, Barbarossa [...] "decided to defer to a more suitable time the settlement" [...] of the quarrel between Géza and Stephen and departed for his campaign against the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League.</b> In accordance with his former promise, Géza sent a troop of 5–600 archers to accompany the emperor to Italy. Before long, Géza's brother, Stephen, left for the Byzantine Empire and settled in Constantinople where he married Emperor Manuel's niece Maria Komnene. Within two years, he was joined by his brother, Ladislaus, who fled from Hungary around 1160.|$|E
500|$|After 1158, {{under the}} new conditions, {{the aims of the}} Byzantine policy changed. Manuel now decided to oppose the {{objective}} of the Hohenstaufen dynasty to directly annex Italy, which Frederick believed should acknowledge his power. When the war between Frederick I Barbarossa and the northern Italian communes started, Manuel actively supported the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> with money subsidies, agents, and, occasionally, troops. The walls of Milan, demolished by the Germans, were restored with the aid of the Byzantine Emperor.* A. A. Vasiliev, History of the Byzantine Empire, [...] Frederick's defeat at the Battle of Legnano, on 29 May 1176, seemed rather to improve Manuel's position in Italy.

Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 84 his relations were also particularly favourable in regard to Genoa and Pisa, but not to Venice. In March 1171 Manuel had suddenly broken with Venice, ordering all 20,000 Venetians on imperial territory to be arrested and their property confiscated. Venice, incensed, sent a fleet of 120 ships against Byzantium. Due to an epidemic, and pursued by 150 Byzantine ships, the fleet was forced to return without great success. In all probability, friendly relations between Byzantium and Venice were not restored in Manuel's lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|The {{siege of}} Alessandria was an {{important}} event in Frederick's fifth campaign as this was a campaign of revenge, {{with the aim of}} the total destruction of the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League</b> and the removal of the Pope Alexander III. Frederick's next goal was therefore the Lombard city of Alessandria. Alessandria was founded by Milanese refugees, who fled after Frederick's forces burned and destroyed the city of Milan in 1162 and named after Pope Alexander III. The siege of the [...] "Straw City", called so because all the roofs were covered with straw, began at the end of October. To Frederick's surprise and anger, his forces were not able to take the city so he had to spend the winter in front of its gates. On Holy Saturday, Frederick's forces managed to enter the city by digging tunnels under its walls, but the attack was repulsed by the Milanese with heavy losses. Alessandria withstood, {{and that was the first}} victory of the <b>Lombard</b> <b>League.</b> Frederick had to break off the siege due to an advancing Lombard army and retreated to Pavia.|$|E
2500|$|The European University proliferated in {{part because}} groups decided to secede from the {{original}} universities to promote their own ideals; the University of Paris fostered many universities in Northern Europe, while the University of Bologna fostered many in the South.
