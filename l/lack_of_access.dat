German personnel losses are clouded by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rogue led developers {{to create their}} own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to Rogues source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to Rogue but with features that they wanted to see. These versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original Rogue source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where changes can be made.|$|E
5|$|Uprising {{was created}} by Masahiro Sakurai after {{receiving}} a request from Satoru Iwata to create a launch title for then-in development 3DS.

Sakurai was responsible for creating the story, which retained the light-hearted tone of the first Kid Icarus. The music {{was created by}} a team of composers that included Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Since release, Uprising has sold over a million copies worldwide, and met with mainly positive reviews; praise was given to the story, graphics, music and gameplay, although the control scheme was frequently faulted.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} {{human rights and}} {{development}} groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed.

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles {{were sent to the}} island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy {{steadily}} deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country. In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2 billion. To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes. In January 1998, riots about <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.|$|E

5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the warm waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
