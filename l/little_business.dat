5|$|Arsenal did <b>little</b> <b>business</b> in the {{transfer}} market {{early in the}} season due to the financial demands that came with the club's new stadium project. The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper Jens Lehmann for £1.5million; striker José Antonio Reyes was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain Patrick Vieira and midfielder Robert Pirès. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League title, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.|$|E

He was easily misled, and occasionally found himself duped by the promise of a new invention or other money-making scheme.|$|E

500|$|After the {{presidency}} of Jimmy Carter (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Reagan brought a Kennedy-esque glamour back into the White House. She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years. She remarked that hosting the dinners is [...] "the easiest thing in the world. You don't have to do anything. Just {{have a good time}} and do a <b>little</b> <b>business.</b> And that's the way Washington works." [...] The White House residence staff found Reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners, with the First Lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations, and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared, before finally settling on one she approved of.|$|E
500|$|On Los Angeles's skid row, penny-pinching Gravis Mushnick owns a florist shop {{which is}} staffed {{by him and}} his two employees, the sweet but simple Audrey Fulquard and clumsy Seymour Krelboyne. Although the rundown shop gets <b>little</b> <b>business,</b> there are some repeat customers; for instance, Mrs. Siddie Shiva shops almost daily for flower {{arrangements}} for her many relatives' funerals. Another regular customer is Burson Fouch, who eats the plants he buys for lunch. When Seymour fouls up the arrangement of Dr. Farb, a sadistic dentist, Mushnick fires him. Hoping Mushnick will change his mind, Seymour tells him about a special plant that he crossbred from a butterwort and a Venus flytrap. Bashfully, Seymour admits that he named the plant [...] "Audrey Jr.", a revelation that delights the real Audrey.|$|E

Comyns Carr's family, who had brought Hastings to dinner at the Grundys' house. After several meetings Hastings proposed, but the wedding was put off {{for a long time}} due to his lack of money. In January 1906, Hastings became the temporary secretary of John Simon, who had just become a Member of Parliament, and when he left the position Simon gave him a cheque for £50. Hastings and his fiancée had [...] "never had so much money before", and on the strength of this they decided to get married. His marriage changed his outlook on life: he now realised that to provide for his wife he would need to work a lot harder at getting cases. To do that he would need to join a well-respected set of chambers; although Gill was giving him briefs he was still in Corbet's chambers, which saw <b>little</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

[...] Stalin personally directed Yezhov to torture those who were not making proper confessions. In one instance, he told Yezhov [...] "Isn't it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty <b>little</b> <b>business?</b> Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?"

2500|$|Later, Michael butchers Wynn's team {{of staff}} {{surgeons}} during a medical procedure and Wynn himself during a medical procedure with Danny and Steven {{sitting in a}} room next door. Tommy finds and frees Kara, Danny, and Steven; they flee from Michael and hide in a laboratory. Regaining consciousness, Loomis helps Kara and the children escape the hospital. When Michael breaks into the room, Tommy injects him with a corrosive liquid and beats him unconscious with a lead pipe. As Tommy, Kara, Danny, and Steven leave, Loomis refuses to come with them as he has [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>business</b> to attend to”. Back inside the building, Michael's mask is seen {{lying on the floor}} of the lab room and Loomis is heard screaming in the background, leaving the fate of both characters unknown.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the finale}} of The Producer's Cut, Kara {{is to be}} used as a human {{sacrifice}} for Myers, and awakens at Smith's Grove Sanitarium on a concrete slab, surrounded by the cult's followers. She is ultimately saved by Tommy, who uses runes to stop Michael from pursuing them, and they escape with Jamie's newborn baby; it is implied by Kara in the film that the baby is a product of incest between Jamie and Michael. The original ending of the sixth film was different, following a different aspect of the plot involving Dr. Wynn and the whole cult keeping true to cult duties, planning Michael to sacrifice the baby to be relinquished from the curse that will be passed onto Danny after he sacrifices his mother. Later, after telling the others he has got “a <b>little</b> <b>business</b> to attend to”, Loomis walks back into the sanitarium to find a seemingly-defeated Michael lying on the floor of the main hallway after having his power drained from him by a circle of runes set by Tommy Doyle. Upon removing the mask telling him it was all over, the person is revealed to be Dr. Wynn, who was forced by Michael to switch outfits so that he could escape. With his dying breath, he grabs Loomis's hand and says, [...] "It's your game now, Dr. Loomis." [...] After Wynn dies, Loomis looks at the wrist of the hand Wynn had just grabbed, and the Thorn symbol appears on his wrist. Realizing now that Loomis himself is now to act as the leader of the cult, he screams. This scream is used in the final ending.|$|E
