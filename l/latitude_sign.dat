Generally vessel speed was kept below about 14 kt (typically 12 kt), and the echo-sounder range set to 80 m.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{latitudinal}} distribution of sunspots observed from 1874 to 2009 using the center-of-latitude (COL). We calculate COL {{by taking the}} area-weighted mean latitude of sunspots for each calendar month. We then form the latitudinal distribution of COL for the sunspots appearing in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres separately, and in both hemispheres with unsigned and <b>signed</b> <b>latitudes,</b> respectively. We repeat the analysis with subsets which are divided based on the criterion of which hemisphere is dominant for a given solar cycle. Our primary findings are as follows: (1) COL is not monotonically decreasing with time in each cycle. Small humps can be seen (or short plateaus) around every solar maxima. (2) The distribution of COL resulting from each hemisphere is bimodal, which can well be represented by the double Gaussian function. (3) As far as the primary component of the double Gaussian function is concerned, for a given data subset, the distributions due to the sunspots appearing in two different hemispheres are alike. Regardless of which hemisphere is magnetically dominant, the primary component of the double Gaussian function seems relatively unchanged. (4) When the northern (southern) hemisphere is dominant the width of the secondary component of the double Gaussian function in the northern (southern) hemisphere case is about twice as wide as that in the southern (northern) hemisphere. (5) For the distribution of the COL averaged with <b>signed</b> <b>latitude,</b> whose distribution is basically described by a single Gaussian function, it is shifted to the positive (negative) side when the northern (southern) hemisphere is dominant. Finally, we conclude by briefly discussing the implications of these findings on the variations in the solar activity. Comment: Accepted for publication in New Astronom...|$|R
40|$|Groisman and Genikhovich {{developed}} {{a method to}} obtain direct estimates of surface turbulent heat fluxes. The authors now apply it to {{the territory of the}} former Soviet Union using the 3 -/ 6 -h data of 257 stations for the past several decades to assess the sensitivity of sensible heat flux to cloud and snow cover. This property was quantified for bare soil landscapes over the entire country. During the day, the presence of clouds is associated with low values of sensible heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere. At night (and during the day in winter in high <b>latitudes),</b> the <b>sign</b> of the effect is different, but because the direction of sensible heat flux is also different (from the atmosphere to the surface), the presence of clouds again reduces the turbulent heat exchange between the bare soil and the atmosphere. The estimates of “overall cloud effect” on summer sensible heat flux are compared with similar estimates from five general circulation models to assess the abilities of these GCMs to reproduce the response of this flux to cloud cover change. Snow on the ground is associated with temperature depression. When the effect of this depression is excluded, the presence of snow on the ground is generally associated with less water vapor in the lower troposphere under clear-sky conditions, while the evaporation rate and sensible heat flux are higher than average...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} set of six 20 year {{experiments}} made with a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model that incorporates the atmosphere from the surface to the lower thermosphere. The response of the middle atmosphere to the 11 year solar cycle, {{its impact on the}} troposphere, and especially the role of an externally prescribed stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is investigated with NCAR's Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM 3). The model experiments use either fixed solar cycle inputs or fixed solar cycle together with prescribed QBO phase. The annual mean solar response in temperature and ozone in the upper stratosphere is in qualitative agreement with other modeling and observational studies and does not depend on the presence of the imposed QBO. However, the solar response in the middle to lower stratosphere differs significantly for the two QBO phases. During solar maxima a weaker Brewer-Dobson circulation with relative downwelling, warming, and enhanced ozone occurs in the tropical lower stratosphere during QBO east conditions, while a stronger circulation, cooling, and decreased ozone exists during QBO west conditions. The net ozone increase during QBO east is the combined result of production and advection, whereas during QBO west the effects cancel each other and result in little net ozone changes. Especially during Southern Hemisphere late winter to early spring, the solar response at polar <b>latitudes</b> switches <b>sign</b> between the two QBO phases and qualitatively confirms observations and other recent model studies. During a poleward downward modulation of the polar night jet and a corresponding modulation of the Brewer-Dobson circulation in time, solar signals are detected {{all the way down to}} the extratropical troposphere. Possible limitations of the model experiments with respect to the fixed solar cycle conditions or the prescribed QBO phases, as well as the constant sea surface temperatures, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of statistical analyses of large climate datasets from two time intervals – the 20 th century instrumental record and the proxy record of the last deglaciation – {{in order to understand the}} forcings and mechanisms of past climate variability. A longstanding question in climate dynamics concerns the origin of Pacific decadal variability (PDV). This issue is addressed by calculating the Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index from Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the 20 th century, which is found to be similar to its Northern Hemisphere counterpart. The Northern and Southern PDO indices both exhibit pronounced seasonality in autocorrelation with interannual persistence of winter SST anomalies despite their absence during the intervening summer, suggesting a role for reemergence. These two indices can be reasonably well reproduced using a first-order autoregressive model forced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, suggesting that Pacific decadal variability on both sides of the equator may largely be a reddened response to tropical forcing. Over 100 high-resolution proxy climate time series spanning parts or all of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to Holocene interval are analyzed to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of glacial-interglacial climate change. Peak glacial and interglacial conditions occurred statistically synchronously between the Northern (22. 1 ± 4. 3 ka and 8. 0 ± 3. 2 ka) and Southern (22. 3 ± 3. 6 ka and 7. 4 ± 3. 7 ka) Hemispheres, suggesting that the hemispheres were synchronized by greenhouse gases, local insolation, and/or ocean circulation. Global cooling during the LGM was likely ≥ 4. 9 °C, but only 0. 6 °C during the Younger Dryas. Younger Dryas climate anomalies exhibit a general hemispheric seesaw pattern with the largest negative anomalies in the high northern <b>latitudes,</b> mixed <b>sign</b> anomalies in the low latitudes, and modest positive anomalies in the high southern latitudes, consistent with an ocean circulation driver of this event. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of 71 records from 19 - 11 ka indicates that 72...|$|R
