The new approach is developed and tested for Munich, Germany by integrating the obtained <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classifications</b> and physical parameters into a 3 -dimensional urban climate model (MUKLIMO_ 3). The model results of a case study are compared to the current approach (reference run) and evaluated against continuous and temporal meteorological measurements. Eight morphological parameters (building surface fraction, wall-area index, building height, impervious surface fraction, leaf area index and vegetation cover of low vegetation, tree cover, as well as tree height) were derived using 3 different earth observation data sets. An IKONOS scene of 17 th September 2003, a Rapid Eye scene of 27 th July 2009 and stereo images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera of 15 th September 2004 were used to derive the urban morphological parameters.

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> is {{essential}} for urban planning. Urban land use types can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have been recognized as a vital method for urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> because {{of their ability to}} capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification,</b> most techniques focus on physical characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used. Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the opportunity to derive land use information from mobile phone data. To verify the application of this new data source to urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification,</b> we first construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize land use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly relative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means clustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is determined with a detection rate of 58. 03 %. An analysis of the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> results shows that the accuracy decreases as the heterogeneity of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers increases.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{applying}} a distributed hydrological model in urban watersheds, grid-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> data with 10 m resolution are typically used in Japan. Land use classifications into 17 categories are made without {{taking into account}} their impermeable properties. Thus, for such a grid-based urban hydrological model, the estimation of the Impervious Area Ratio (IAR) of each <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> is a crucial factor for accurate runoff analysis in urban watersheds. However, so far IAR of each classification is estimated very roughly and applied in the corresponding hydrologic models almost empirically. Thus {{in order to assess}} the IAR accurately, we created a set of vector-based “urban landscape GIS delineation” data for a typical urban watershed in Tokyo using detailed land use recognition, which exactly delineated the pervious and impervious features into 20 land use types in the watershed. These vector data are used to improve the impervious area depiction of grid-based land use classifications. By superimposing the vector-based delineation map on the grid-based map, the IAR of each grid-based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> was estimated with very little uncertainty, after calculating the IARs of all grid cells in the entire urban watershed. As a result, we were able to calculate the frequency distribution of IAR for each <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>classification</b> as well as the spatial distribution of IARs for the urban watershed...|$|E
