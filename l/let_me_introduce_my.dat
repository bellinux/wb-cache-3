I graduated from an undergraduate course trained in classical economics, law and normative urban planning processes.

All of my friends are brilliant people who have worked very hard to get their degrees and their corporate jobs but as I was awarded my degree, I was unaware of how little I questioned the texts we read or the privilege I was surrounded by.
