5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} <b>larval</b> <b>form.</b> Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism in Lepidoptera is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} and the P. rebeli caterpillar is no exception as it displays polymorphism in its <b>larval</b> <b>form.</b> The P. rebeli caterpillars have two strategies for living and growing underground: to exist as fast-developing larvae (FDL) or slow-developing larvae (SDL). After the ant brood adopts the FDL, which comprise approximately 25% of the total P. rebeli larvae, the FDL complete growth the following spring and eclose (emerge as an adult from the pupa) in early summer to complete their life cycle. The SDL, which comprise 75% of P. rebeli larvae, do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of}} the second summer and remain a second winter within the ant colonies. While both larva types ultimately form similar-sized pupae, their polymorphic growth rates could indicate alternative fitness strategies and different ways to exploit the M. schencki food resources.|$|E

5|$|Thyroxine is {{critical}} to the regulation of metabolism and growth throughout the animal kingdom. For example, Iodine and T4 trigger the change from a plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> of aquatic axolotl. Among amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as propylthiouracil (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely {{played a crucial role in}} the evolution of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
25|$|Young isopod {{crustaceans}} hatch {{directly into}} a manca stage, which is similar in appearance to the adult. The lack of a free-swimming <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> has led to high rates of endemism in isopods, but has also allowed them to colonise the land, {{in the form of}} the woodlice.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Trematomus newnesi (Nototheniidae), a bentho−pelagic fish, {{caught off}} Adélie Land (eastern Antarctic) was {{examined}} {{for the presence}} of internal parasitic worms. These fishes were infected with 11 species and <b>larval</b> <b>forms</b> of parasites: Digenea (Macvicaria pennelli, Neolebouria terranovaensis, Genolinea bowersi, and Elytrophalloides oatesi), <b>larval</b> Cestoda (two <b>forms</b> of tetraphyllidean metacestodes, bilocular form and trilocular form, and diphyllobothriid plerocercoids), Acanthocephala (Metacanthocephalus camp− belli, M. johnstoni) and larval Nematoda (Contracaecum osculatum, C. radiatum). Larval cestodes were the dominant parasites, whereas acanthocephalans were relatively rare. Five species and <b>larval</b> <b>forms</b> were recorded also in fish caught in the Davis Sea. A check list of parasites of T. newnesi recorded in the eastern − and western Antarctic comprises 21 species and <b>larval</b> <b>forms.</b> Probably, T. newnesi {{plays an important role in}} life cycles of parasitic worms in the Antarctic...|$|R

25|$|He also {{considered}} the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst {{still in its}} gilled <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> without maturing into a terrestrial adult.

25|$|Aliens are eusocial life-forms with a {{caste system}} ruled {{over by a}} queen.

25|$|Some ambush predators build traps {{to capture}} their prey. Lacewings are a flying insect {{in the order}} Neuroptera.

25|$|After {{a growth}} interval, the polyp begins {{reproducing}} asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, {{is called a}} segmenting polyp, or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs, the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae. Polyps asexually produce free-swimming ephyra, which then become a medusa. New specimens (usually only a millimeter or two across) swim away from the polyp and then grow. Some polyps can asexually produce a creeping frustule <b>larval</b> <b>form,</b> which then develops into another polyp.|$|E

25|$|The {{larval stage}} of the beetle {{typically}} goes through two instars, the second instar is the longest stage of its entire development, taking up 39% of the overall development time. It takes 5.1 days +/- 0.1 on average for the first instar to develop into the second. The <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> of the insect will range in length from three millimeters to several centimeters. They have a membranous body with {{a limited amount of}} sclerotization around the head. There is some pigmentation around the body and it is horizontally segmented. The legs are short and do not help much in locomotion. They move mostly through muscular contraction.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} {{classified}} as crabs, the larvae of Dromiacea {{are similar to those}} of the Anomura, which led many scientists to place dromiacean crabs in the Anomura, rather than with the other crabs. Apart from the Dromiacea, all crabs share a similar and distinctive <b>larval</b> <b>form.</b> The crab zoea has a slender, curved abdomen and a forked telson, but its most striking features are the long rostral and dorsal spines, sometimes augmented by further, lateral spines. These spines can be many times longer than the body of the larva. Crab prezoea larvae have been found fossilised in the stomach contents of the Early Cretaceous bony fish Tharrhias.|$|E
25|$|Eggs of C. sapidus hatch in high {{salinity}} {{waters of}} inlets, coastal waters, and mouths of rivers and are {{carried to the}} ocean by ebb tides. During seven planktonic (zoeal) stages blue crab larvae float near the surface and feed on microorganisms they encounter. After the eighth zoeal stage, larvae molt into megalopae. This <b>larval</b> <b>form</b> has small claws called chelipeds for grasping prey items. Megalopae selectively migrate upward {{in the water column}} as tides travel landward toward estuaries. Eventually blue crabs arrive in brackish water, where they spend the majority of their life. Chemical cues in estuarine water prompt metamorphosis to the juvenile phase, after which blue crabs appear similar to the adult form.|$|E
