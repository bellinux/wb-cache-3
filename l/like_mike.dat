25|$|The {{franchise}} {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary in the OHL in 2004–05. The {{race for the}} central division title was close the entire year. By {{the end of the}} season the difference between first and fourth place was only four points. The Colts finished second in the central division; three points behind leaders Mississauga IceDogs, and one point ahead of Brampton Battalion and Sudbury Wolves. Second year player Bryan Little continued to build upon the success of his rookie season, scoring 36 goals and 32 assists for a total of 68 points. Third year Colt Hunter Tremblay was not that far behind, scoring a total of 62 points. Filling out the Colts offence were the likes of Travis Fuller, Dan Speer, and B.J. Crombeen. Rookie defencemen Andrew Marshall, Nathan Martine, Todd Perry, and Nick Plastino, along with local brothers Andrew Hotham, and Scott Hotham would protect the Colts goal all season. Throughout the season, the Colts would make trades that brought in guys like high scoring overager Rob Hisey from the Erie Otters, young role players <b>like</b> <b>Mike</b> Roelofsen and Daniel Lombardi, and a proven goalie in Dan LaCosta. Heading into the playoffs the Colts would look to have plenty of promise for the present, as well as the future.

25|$|Chunn {{decided to}} leave {{at the end of}} the US tour, partly because he wanted to spend more time with his family but also because he {{suffered}} from agoraphobia. But tensions were also increasing between Phil and Tim. Although the band received a standing ovation in San Francisco, audience reactions in more remote areas ranged from puzzlement to outright hostility, and Phil was extremely sensitive to such negative reactions. Also <b>like</b> <b>Mike</b> Chunn he had a young family back in New Zealand and was tired of the endless grind of touring. The tensions climaxed after a concert when Phil, who was having trouble with an out-of-tune guitar, stormed off before the end of the set and when Tim challenged him backstage about what had happened, Phil punched him. The tour ended in April, and Phil left the band. They were due to begin their third English tour later that month, so Tim now took charge and hastily reorganised the group. On 4 April English bassist Nigel Griggs (ex-Octopus) was hired to replace Mike Chunn, who gave Tim a crucial piece of parting advice -- he suggested Tim's younger brother Neil as the replacement for Phil Judd. At the time Neil was playing in local Auckland band Afterhours, led by Geoff Chunn, plus Neil and Mark Hough, (aka Buster Stiggs who later joined The Swingers with Phil Judd). Neil flew to England as soon as he received the call from Tim and he officially joined Split Enz on 7 April 1977.|$|E
