5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth <b>laminar</b> flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from <b>laminar</b> to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the <b>laminar</b> portion of the boundary layer. The low energy <b>laminar</b> flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain <b>laminar</b> flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the <b>laminar</b> boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a <b>laminar</b> boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of <b>laminar</b> separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so <b>laminar</b> separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
5|$|These {{solutions}} {{apply for}} <b>laminar</b> flow with a Prandtl/Schmidt number greater than 0.6.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a <b>laminar</b> boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of <b>laminar</b> flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural <b>laminar</b> flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural <b>Laminar</b> Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural <b>laminar</b> flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from <b>laminar</b> to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural <b>Laminar</b> Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E
5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous <b>laminar</b> or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in <b>laminar</b> flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional <b>laminar</b> boundary layer that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution to wedge flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows {{in which the}} plate is not parallel to the flow.|$|E
5|$|The viscous {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} skin friction. The layer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are {{two different types of}} boundary layer flow: <b>laminar</b> and turbulent.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects. Smooth (<b>laminar)</b> flow starts to break up when {{the size of the}} obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the viscosity of the fluid.|$|E
5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true <b>laminar</b> flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1946, {{five days}} after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new {{aircraft}} similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with improved aerodynamics. This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with <b>laminar</b> flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the <b>laminar</b> {{boundary}} layer equations, {{the presence of}} two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid <b>laminar</b> flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight <b>laminar</b> flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Laminar</b> {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|Flow {{instability}} is {{the engine}} for whistles. It converts steady energy to time dependent energy. Conversion of <b>laminar</b> flow to turbulent flow {{is a well}} known example. Small disturbances to the <b>laminar</b> flow cause the transition.|$|E
25|$|Poiseuille's law {{on blood}} {{circulation}} {{in the body}} is dependent on <b>laminar</b> flow. In turbulent flow the flow rate {{is proportional to the}} square root of the pressure gradient, as opposed to its direct proportionality to pressure gradient in <b>laminar</b> flow.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing <b>laminar</b> or turbulent air flow principles. <b>Laminar,</b> or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. <b>Laminar</b> air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct <b>laminar</b> air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both <b>laminar</b> air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E
25|$|Assume {{the liquid}} {{exhibits}} <b>laminar</b> flow. <b>Laminar</b> flow {{in a round}} pipe prescribes {{that there are a}} bunch of circular layers (lamina) of liquid, each having a velocity determined only by their radial distance from the center of the tube. Also assume the center is moving fastest while the liquid touching the walls of the tube is stationary (due to the no-slip condition).|$|E
25|$|The {{assumptions}} of the equation are that the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian; the flow is <b>laminar</b> through a pipe of constant circular cross-section that is substantially longer than its diameter; {{and there is no}} acceleration of fluid in the pipe. For velocities and pipe diameters above a threshold, actual fluid flow is not <b>laminar</b> but turbulent, leading to larger pressure drops than calculated by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.|$|E
25|$|Heisenberg's {{doctoral}} thesis, {{the topic}} of which was suggested by Sommerfeld, was on turbulence; the thesis discussed both the stability of <b>laminar</b> flow {{and the nature of}} turbulent flow. The problem of stability was investigated by the use of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation, a fourth order linear differential equation for small disturbances from <b>laminar</b> flow. He briefly returned to this topic after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Under {{conditions}} of low flowrates (or <b>laminar</b> flow), {{such that the}} typical shell-and-tube exchangers have low heat-transfer coefficients and becoming uneconomical.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} {{of stress in}} liquids started with Newton, who provided a differential formula for friction forces (shear stress) in parallel <b>laminar</b> flow.|$|E
25|$|As {{ambient air}} becomes hotter, {{additional}} evaporation {{can take place}} lower in the trachea making {{its way to the}} posterior sacs, shunting the lung surface. The trachea acts as a buffer for evaporation because of the length, and the controlled vascularization. The Gular is also heavily vascularized; its purpose is for cooling blood, but also evaporation, as previously stated. Air flowing through the trachea can be either <b>laminar</b> or turbulent depending {{on the state of the}} bird. When the common ostrich is breathing normally, under no heat stress, air flow is <b>laminar.</b> When the common ostrich is experiencing heat stress from the environment the air flow is considered turbulent. This suggests that <b>laminar</b> air flow causes little to no heat transfer, while under heat stress turbulent airflow can cause maximum heat transfer within the trachea.|$|E
25|$|Osborne Reynolds famously {{studied the}} {{conditions}} in which the flow of fluid in pipes transitioned from <b>laminar</b> flow to turbulent flow.|$|E

25|$|Oil: When oil {{is applied}} to the model surface it can clearly show the {{transition}} from <b>laminar</b> to turbulent flow as well as flow separation.|$|E
25|$|British engineers, {{like the}} Americans, had a growing {{interest}} during World War II {{in the application}} of <b>laminar</b> flow airfoils. In an effort {{to learn more about the}} practical application of <b>laminar</b> flow airfoils, in 1945 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) undertook a flight test program with one of the two P-63As that the United Kingdom had received. The aircraft was equipped with a wake rake array mounted outboard, behind the wing, to allow the momentum deficit, and thus section drag, to be measured.|$|E
25|$|In fluid mechanics, {{waves are}} {{classified}} as <b>laminar,</b> but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence ("breaking waves") under the general heading of waves.|$|E
25|$|Trials of a <b>laminar</b> flow wing (in the XP-39E) and Continental IV-1430 engine (the P-76) were unsuccessful. The mid-engine, gun-through-hub {{concept was}} {{developed}} {{further in the}} Bell P-63 Kingcobra.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support <b>laminar</b> flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% <b>laminar</b> flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of <b>laminar</b> flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of <b>laminar</b> flow airfoils.|$|E

25|$|Laminar-flow {{control is}} a {{technology}} that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is <b>laminar,</b> then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a <b>laminar</b> one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).|$|E
