5|$|As the Soviets {{approached}} Berlin, Hitler's {{efforts to}} organise the defence {{of the city}} became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for <b>leave-taking</b> for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed, and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere. Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, {{the same day that}} Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide. He also stated that Göring was {{in a better position to}} negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} is {{cast as a}} broad rondo in two main sections: ABAB–CADA. The {{first half of the}} movement sets up the expectation of an ABABA pattern. The interruption of this pattern with new music just before its expected conclusion gives the rest of the movement the feeling of a vast extension. This extended <b>leave-taking</b> acts as a coda for the suite as a whole.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we peruse the {{functions}} of greetings and <b>leave-takings</b> in a genre which shares many traits with films but {{which has its own}} distinctive features and has recently gained tremendous success by reaching millions of people – i. e. TV series. More specifically, we concentrate on greetings and <b>leave-takings</b> that open and close conversations, trying to highlight how much narrative space they are granted and how frequent they are in both original and dubbed dialogues...|$|R

25|$|In Manitou Springs, Colorado, Epiphany {{is marked}} by the Great Fruitcake Toss. Fruitcakes are thrown, {{participants}} dress as kings, fools, etc., and competitions are held for the farthest throw, the most creative projectile device, etc. As with customs in other countries, the fruitcake toss {{is a sort of}} festive symbolic <b>leave-taking</b> of the Christmas holidays until next year, but with humorous twist, since fruitcake (although the traditional Christmas bread of America, England and other English speaking nations) is considered in the United States with a certain degree of derision, and is the source of many jokes.|$|E
25|$|The prayers {{specifically}} {{mentioned in}} the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum are not of the Latin Church tradition alone, {{but also from the}} traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches, such as the Akathistos, Paraklesis, Evening Prayer, and Prayer for the Faithful Departed (Byzantine), Prayer of Thanksgiving (Armenian), Prayer of the Shrine and the Lakhu Mara (Chaldean), Prayer of Incense and Prayer to Glorify Mary the Mother of God (Coptic), Prayer for the Remission of Sins and Prayer to Follow Christ (Ethiopian), Prayer for the Church, and Prayer of <b>Leave-taking</b> from the Altar (Maronite), and Intercessions for the Faithful Departed (Syrian).|$|E

[...] Dwight blackmails Oscar, threatening to reveal his unauthorized <b>leave-taking.</b> He then cuts a deal for Oscar to owe him a favor, and watches a movie with Oscar and Oscar's [...] "roommate" [...] Gil (Tom W. Chick) while completely failing to recognize evidence of Oscar's homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|... "Caravan" [...] and [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] {{were cited}} by Harrington as {{examples}} of Morrison's interest in [...] "the mystifying powers of the music itself" [...] throughout Moondance. The former song thematizes music radio and gypsy life—which fascinated the singer—as symbols of harmony. Harrington called it an ode to [...] "the transcendent powers of rock 'n' roll and the spontaneous pleasures of listening to a great radio station", while biographer Erik Hage regarded it as [...] "a joyful celebration of communal spirit, the music of radio, and romantic love". [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] reconciles Moondances R style with the more orchestrated folk music of Astral Weeks, along with what Evans described as [...] "the complimentary sides of Morrison's psyche". Harrington believed it explores [...] "the intricate balance between life's natural wonder and the cosmic harmony of the universe". Hinton said the song evoked a sense of [...] "visionary stillness" [...] shared with [...] "And It Stoned Me" [...] and the gypsy imagery of [...] "Caravan", while working on several other interpretive levels. Its images of setting sail and water in particular represented [...] "a means of magical transformation" [...] for the writer, comparable to Alfred Lord Tennyson's poems of <b>leave-taking</b> such as [...] "Crossing the Bar", which had [...] "the same sense of crossing over, both to another land and into death". The lyrics also deal with [...] "the mystical union of good sex", and an act of love Hinton said was intimated by Morrison's closing vocal [...] "too late to stop now"—a phrase the singer would use to conclude his concerts in subsequent years.|$|E
2500|$|The liturgical {{season from}} Easter to the Sunday of All Saints (the Sunday after Pentecost) {{is known as}} the Pentecostarion (the [...] "fifty days"). The week which begins on Easter Sunday is called Bright Week, during which there is no fasting, even on Wednesday and Friday. The Afterfeast of Easter lasts 39 days, with its Apodosis (<b>leave-taking)</b> on the day before Ascension. Pentecost Sunday is the fiftieth day from Easter (counted inclusively).|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years and}} {{eight months after}} Hitler's rise to power and nearly three years after his <b>leave-taking</b> of the army, on 1 October 1935, Braemer [...] then aged 52 [...] stirred himself from {{retirement}} to join the SS with the rank of Standartenführer (regiment leader), the sixth-highest SS rank [...] once again [...] "flashforward-fashion", before he joined the Nazi party [...] receiving the SS-Nummer (or membership number) 223910, and in this rank was posted as a [...] "training consultant" [...] to the General Staff of the SS circuit or Oberabschnitt known as command Nord (not an army post), where he stayed until 15April 1936, {{to be transferred to}} the Oberabschnitt Nordwest for one month, before being moved again to the Oberabschnitt Nordsee, where he stayed until 1July 1938. All three SS districts in question were at the time headquartered at Altona in Hamburg. In the course of his SS service Braemer gained two promotions, ultimately to Brigadeführer, the fourth-highest rank in the SS, a remarkably quick climb accomplished in less than 2years and 9months since joining the ranks. The latter rank of Brigadeführer was conferred on him only after he had become member of the Nazi party sometime in 1937 (the exact date of his joining the NSDAP has not been established) with the membership number 4012329. At this time Braemer involved himself with Himmler's Lebensborn Society, an organization whose purpose was to devise ways and means of engineering the genetic makeup of the German nation by promoting Nazi eugenics and [...] "breeding" [...] pure [...] "Aryans".|$|E

Her tears were tears of dread lest, surrounded by perils in the world, I should succumb and thus falsify her vows.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the use of greetings, <b>leave-takings</b> and good wishes in English film dialogue and in Italian dubbed language. Although these conversational routines are scarcely informative, they play in fact a paramount role in establishing a relational function within interpersonal interactions. Also, we expect possible discrepancies to emerge in the cross-linguistic mapping, due to asymmetry in the respective repertoires of formulae and to asymmetry in the identification of relevant time spans...|$|R

[...] According to Frank Rich, the play's [...] "meager plot - an {{arbitrary}} coupling or two, followed by equally whimsical <b>leave-takings</b> and reunions - leads to {{nothing more than a}} sentimental final-curtain reaffirmation of the transforming powers of true love."
