5|$|Webber was {{retained}} by Red Bull Racing for 2013, {{which was to}} be his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> the team.

5|$|Melbourne's poor form {{throughout}} the 2007 season, when they won just five matches, saw the side finish 14th. White brought up his milestone 250th AFL-game in Round 19 {{with a win}} over the Western Bulldogs. His <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> Melbourne was 2008, {{in which he was}} dropped {{for the first time in}} his Melbourne career, despite returning to some of his best form. His average number of disposals per match (18.5) was the highest of any season in his career. His long-time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White's position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne, allowing Paul Johnson to play the second-ruckman role. It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other than White or Jim Stynes had been the first-choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches. Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 was the most difficult season that White and team-mate Adem Yze had experienced at the club—the side finished bottom and won just three games. Bailey praised both White and Yze on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season—the pair's last at Melbourne. White played 15games in 2008—his lowest total in a season with Melbourne. He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond, kicking two goals and having 17possessions. He received 53Brownlow votes throughout his career—47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle.

He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7, 2008, in Melbourne's win over Fremantle. He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14AFL seasons.|$|E
