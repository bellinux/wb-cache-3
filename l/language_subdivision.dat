40|$|Introduction: The public {{database}} HbVar ([URL] contains {{information on}} 1, 324 molecular variants, including 979 haemoglobin variants and 395 thalassaemia entries. Although much {{research has been}} conducted on molecular and clinical aspects of thalassaemia and other haemoglobin variants, to date the underlying contribution of population genetics has received little attention. Objectives : To investigate examples of geographical and regional variation in B-thalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies in order to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the available data in HbVar, and their applicability to community- and population-based studies. Methods: Information on haemoglobin variants listed in HbVar was initially examined and data on Indian, Pakistani and Italian individuals and communities were selected and abstracted. These data were then subjected to Venn analysis and GIS mapping. Results: Few data were available for the Indian sub-continent. The initial analysis also revealed a lack of clear delineation of regional and community identification in the information listed for Indian and Pakistani individuals, thus limiting its application to population genetiCS analysis. To overcome these limitations, a method of analysis was developed for mapping Italian data on haemoglobin variants using Google Map technology. Conclusions: In countries such as India and Pakistan, with multiple geographical, ethnic, <b>language</b> and social <b>subdivisions,</b> it is probable that many haemoglobin variants and thalassaemia mutations are community-specific. The ability to pinpoint regional and community variants would greatly assist genomic screening and prenatal diagnosis programmes.

Because thesubdivision plat and ordinance specified that the permitted use of the subject propertywas a duplex, and that such use of the duplex as a hotel or a lodge was not permitted,their objective import clearly was to prohibit uses inconsistent with the residentialcharacter of the area. See Town of Alta v. Ben Hame Corp., 836 P.2d 797, 801 (UtahCt.App.1992); see also Ord. No. 79-12, art.

This reading of the subdivision plat and ordinancecomports with the general purposes those regulations serve. Among the objectives to beserved by zoning is to avoid mixing together of industrial, commercial, business, andresidential uses. Cf. § 31-23-301, C.R.S.2006.

40|$|Child {{language}} {{development is a}} complex process. This process cannot be understood without considering its relationship to other developmental domains. Language development in preschool years is associated with development of motor skills and behavior problems, and these associations {{are the focus of}} the current thesis. Despite a large number of studies examining the co-occurrence of such developmental delays and problems, few studies have examined the developmental relationship between these areas during preschool years in a population-based sample. The first aim (paper 1) is therefore to look at how variation in typical development of language skills and motor skills is related. We especially want to explore whether the developmental paths for language and motor skills are characterized by stability or change in early childhood (1. 5 to 3 of age). The second aim (paper 2) is to follow up results from paper 1 later in preschool years (3 to 5 years of age). Further, we want to look at how much of the variation in language skills can be explained by motor skills and vice versa. The third aim (paper 3) is to investigate the causal direction of the co-occurrence of language delay and externalizing behavior problems. The relationship between difficulties in these two domains is well established, but few studies have tried to estimate the causal relationship between them. Our hypothesis is that there would be differences in causal directions for the relationship between language delay and two separate subdomains of externalizing problems, aggression and inattention, respectively. For the purpose of the three papers included in this thesis, questionnaire data from three waves of the population based, longitudinal Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) are utilized. Mothers’ reports were collected when children were 1. 5, 3 and 5 years of age. Paper 1 includes data on 62, 944 children from the first two waves of data collection. Paper 2 includes data from the two last waves, and paper 3 includes data from all three waves. In paper 2 and 3, mother reports on 25, 474 children are included in the analyses. In paper 1 and paper 2 we used cross lagged panel models for investigating the autoregressive and cross-lagged associations between language and motor skills. Results from paper 1 show that both communication and motor skills were quite stable over time (communication skills:. 40, motor skills:. 80), with motor skills being significantly more stable than communication skills. However, whereas communication skills do not positively predict motor skills, motor skills are an equally strong predictor of future communication (. 38) as motor skills. We conclude that the communication skills at this age are not a reliable predictor for later motor development, whereas motor skills are. Communication and motor skills are correlated at this early age, but we argue that variation in what is considered normal {{language development}} at 1 ½ years is too wide to predict variation in motor skills at later stages. In paper 2 we go on to study the relations between <b>language</b> and a <b>subdivision</b> of gross and fine motor skills between the ages of 3 and 5 years, in order to understand whether one aspects of motor skills would be more predictive of language than the other, and whether language would be predictive of motors skills at this later age. The estimated models of the relationship between language and the two domains of motor skills correspond to the one presented in paper 1. Both domains are characterized by modest to high stability rather than change (language skills:. 80, gross motor skills:. 56, fine motor skills:. 43). However, in contrast to results from paper 1, language skills at 3 years of age have significant influence on change in both gross and fine motor skills over time, whereas motor skills no longer significantly predict later language skills. We go on to calculate how much of the shared variance is explained specifically by language and gross and fine motor skills, respectively. Results from these analyses suggest that variance explained by language alone decreases, whereas variance explained by motor skills alone increases from 3 to 5 years of age. We conclude that these domains of development are best described as specific at this age. Seen together, results from paper 1 and paper 2 indicate stability in both domains, but also some variability across domains. Motor skills are highly stable from 1. 5 to 3 years of age, and motor skills at 1. 5 years predict later language skills. From 3 to 5 years of age language skills show higher stability than motor skills, and language skills at 3 years predict later both gross and fine motor skills. In paper 3, we change focus from variation in typical development to differences between delayed and typical development. Children with language delay are thought to be at risk for a spectrum of co-occurring difficulties, and in this paper, we investigate the causal relationship between language delay and inattention and aggression, respectively. We include data from all three waves in fixed effects models. The results show that the causal relationship between language delay and inattention {{is quite different from the}} relationship between language delay and aggression. Whereas the first is explained by common factors and a reciprocal relationship between the two, the best fitting model for the relationship between language and aggression is one where language delay predicts aggression, and not the other way around. We conclude that our results support different etiologies for the relationship between language delay and inattention and aggression, respectively. Findings from the three papers highlight the importance of knowledge about developmental change in preschool years. These findings underline the value of utilizing data from more than one measurement occasion in order to capture how language skills are related to co-occurring skills in young children. Also, estimating different outcomes simultaneously, in the same study population enable the possibility to compare parameters directly. The results also have implications for prevention and intervention. Co-occurrence of symptoms is common in preschool years and changes happen rapidly. What is considered normal at one point in time quickly changes to being abnormal at another time point. When assessing young children with language delays, it is important to be aware of the difficulties this child could have in other areas. Knowledge about how symptoms of different developmental delays influence each other over time is essential to adapt treatment strategies to each individual child. It is therefore important that clinicians follow development in more than one area closely, as both co-occurrence of symptoms, and a change in presentation of symptoms are common...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{looks at}} isoglosses transcending the {{traditional}} subdivisions of the Iranian branch of Indo-European. It will discuss how {{to account for}} the data uncovered by recent discoveries and research, and will look at the relation of inherited features and those caused by <b>language</b> contact. The <b>subdivisions</b> of the Iranian branch of Indo-European have been established roughly a century ago, {{at a time when many}} Middle an New Iranian where only fragmentarily documented, if at all. This subdivision has become questionable by new data from Middle and New Iranian languages. First, Eastern Iranian has been shown not to be a genetic entity, and its ancestor language inexistent: "it does not seem possible to regard the Eastern Iranian group as a whole—even disregarding Parachi and Ormuri—as a genetic grouping. Such a conception would imply the existence of an ancestral "proto-Eastern Iranian" intermediate between "common Iranian" and the attested Eastern Iranian languages; but if one reconstructs "proto-Eastern Iranian" in such a way as to account for all the features of the group, it proves to be identical to the "common Iranian" reconstructible as the ancestor of the whole Iranian family. " (SIMS-WILLIAMS 1996 : 651 b) Similarly, the dichotomy of Western Iranian has proven untenable because the isoglosses do not yield a two-way distinction once one adds some data from New Iranian languages. In addition to new data that make subdivisions questionable, there are also methodological problems with the inventories of isoglosses used so far for the subgrouping of Iranian. The subdivision of Western Iranian is based on TEDESCO 1921, whose aim was to distinguish the “dialects” in the Middle Iranian Manichean texts found in Chinese Turkestan; his list of differences between what is now known as Middle Persian and Parthian continues to be used to distinguish a Northern and a Southern subbranch of Western Iranian. This use of TEDESCO’s isoglosses implies three misunderstandings: • every difference between Persian and Parthian is good as an isogloss; • features for which Persian and Parthian agree are per definitionem not an isogloss; • agreement of Persian and Parthian is indicative for all of Western Iranian. None of these premises is tenable. For instance, the development of Proto-Iranian vocalic r (*ṛ) has not been used as an isogloss since Parthian and Middle Persian show the same result (ir in neutral context, e. g. kird “done”, tirs “fear”); this result has often been viewed as the result for all of Western Iranian. However, New Iranian languages suggest otherwise: Balochi shows kurt, turs (and Gilaki might show the same result: kud), and Zazaki has /ar/ (written er in contemporary orthography: kerd, ters), similarly maybe also in (some varities of?) Talyshi (kard). This clearly excludes that the development seen in Middle Western Iranian applies to the whole group. This difference, small though it may seem, appears to be an important isogloss: as soon as *ṛ has yielded ir, ur or ar, this sequence is indistinguishable from old sequences of vowel plus r and the development is a “point of no return” in establishing a dialect group, dividing Middle Persian plus Parthian from other Western Iranian languages. Another problem with TEDESCO’s approach is that he considers shared innovations as less relavant because they “can always be independent of each other and only parallel” (TEDESCO 1921 : 246). Although an accidental parallel development is of course impossible to exclude, the probability of this being the case depends on whether or not it is a typologically marked development. Indeed, shared morphological innovation are considered as particularly importan by others: “It is now generally agreed among linguists that the most certain sub-groups are constructed on the basis of unique shared morphological innovations” (CLACKSON 2007 : 5). According to this view, shared morphological innovations permit the establishment of a subbranch and the reconstruction of a common ancestor intermediate between the individual languages and the protolanguage. This sheds an interesting light on Bactrian, which shares a number of features with Parthian, in spite of its being regarded as Eastern Iranian. The most noteworthy of these are an optative 3 PL composed of the 3 PL indicative to which the 3 SG optative ending is affixed and a imperfect in -āz the etymology of which is not clear, but it seems to be a combination of a fossilised verb form with a particle. In view of CLACKSON’s view cited above, this group of shared innovations (to which other shared features might be added) would permit the reconstruction of a subbranch containing at least Parthian and Bactrian. On the other hand, Bactrian also shares a number of features with other Eastern Iranian languages. The number of shared morphological innovations appears to be smaller than those shared with Parthian, but a noteworthy one is the pronoun of the 2 PL, being composed of the 2 SG pronoun to which the 1 PL pronoun is suffixed (thus “youSG -we”), which Bactrian shares with some Pamir languages. It seems impossible to include the Pamir languages (which are unlikely to be a genetic unity) in the same subbranch; that branch would also risk to cover all of Iranian. The question to be discussed is, thus, whether morphological innovations could also be the result of language contact. Indeed, FRIEDMAN (2000), reviewing the Balkan languages, the classical case of a linguistic area, maintains that grammatical features are “key to the concept of areal linguistics – as opposed to typological or genetic linguistics”. I will argue that the relations among Iranian languages need to be reevaluated in the light of the interaction of inherited features and those caused by language contact. It needs to be investigated which features can possibly or plausibly caused by language contact; at the same time, the features that are likely to be inherited need to be accomodated. Clearly, new models are needed to account for data not included in the classical studies on the subgroupings of Iranian. Bibliography :CLACKSON, James 2007 : Indo-European Linguistics.
