Our empirical results suggest that strategic behaviour seems to be relevant {{for the design of}} <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts,</b> whereas inventor moral hazard and risk aversion of licensor or licensee seem to be irrelevant. Moreover, our results suggest that uncertainty regarding the profitability of licensed technology influenced the design of <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> More specifically, profit sharing agreements or producer milestones were typically included into <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> Economic History, Germany, pre- 1913, <b>Licensing</b> <b>contracts,</b> Technology transfer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a model of}} vertically related market between upstream monopolistic innovator and downstream oligopolistic firms where polluting firms may purchase a license of pollution abatement technology from an upstream innovator. When the government imposes an emission tax on polluting industry, polluting firms {{are faced with the}} choice of getting an abatement technology license or not. We compare royalty <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> and two-part tariff <b>licensing</b> <b>contract,</b> where fixed-fee for licensing and royalty for purchasing a clean technology are included, and examine the welfare-improving case where the licensing of environmental patent can reduce pollution. The followings are the main findings of our analysis. Under royalty <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> with low emission tax, all polluting firms will not buy clean technology while they will purchase it if the government imposes sufficiently high emission tax. However, both innovator's profit and social welfare will increase under two-part tariff <b>licensing</b> <b>contract.</b> Thus, two-part tariff <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> can induce polluting downstream firms to purchase a clean technology and improve social welfare, even though the two-part tariff <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> is not always socially desirable...|$|R

We assemble a data set {{of all the}} foreign technology licensing agreements entered into by manufacturing firms in India between 1989 and 1993. Industry, firm, and contract characteristics are used to explain differences between the forms of payment in <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts.</b> Our findings support theoretical arguments; <b>licensing</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are more likely to}} use royalties when sales are relatively high, while increased volatility of sales and greater profitability favor fixed fee contracts. We also find that firms are more likely to use output based payments to control the sale and diffusion of R&D or brand intensive know-how to unaffiliated firms.

(2) Cross-licensing is more prevalent between large and symmetric firms. (3) A <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> with only patents is more likely to involve cross-licensing than that with only trade secret.

The paper shows that mixed <b>licensing</b> <b>contract</b> is optimal as the innovation size relative to the innovation size is large under non-drastic innovation, while royalty licensing is optimal, otherwise.

Specifically, for small cost-reducing or quality-improving innovations, charging a royalty is optimal. For large cost-reducing or quality-improving innovations, licensing by means of a fee and a royalty is superior to using either alone. However, for the case of horizontal product innovations, using a fee contract is optimal. ...|$|R
