50|$|Claremont {{station is}} located in the middle of Claremont. The railway's {{right-of-way}} lies between two arterial roads: Shenton Road and Gugeri Street. There are three access points to the station from each street. At the western and eastern ends of the island platform are grade <b>level</b> <b>track</b> <b>crossings</b> through electrically activated gates. In the centre of the platform the original pedestrian bridge provides access by stairs to the platform and to the elevated signal box.|$|E
50|$|As the CN {{lines that}} Via uses were {{designed}} and used primarily for freight services, offering true high-speed support would be difficult. For services at speeds {{significantly greater than}} 150 km/h, fencing {{would have to be}} installed along the <b>tracks,</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> removed or greatly improved, additional signals installed or switched to in-cab signalling, and many railroad switches replaced with versions suitable for high-speed service. None of these changes would be a major benefit to CN. Even with full upgrades to the existing lines, scheduling issues would limit the maximum possible performance along The Corridor, as Via services ran behind freight.|$|R
50|$|From 2007 to 2009 the 1700 metre long {{elevated}} railway (Pfeilerbahn) in {{the port}} area south of Hamburg Hauptbahnhof was torn down and rebuilt. It had been moved {{in order to provide}} a new approach to the central station that would not be threatened by flooding or involved any <b>track</b> <b>crossings.</b>|$|R

The third design-build contract was awarded in February 2013 to Webcor Builders for the intermodal parking facilities and enhancements.|$|R
50|$|Kyle Petty's No Fear Racing was {{released}} in Japan as Circuit USA (サーキットＵＳＡ) by Virgin Interactive. The tracks are stripped of their realism. Furthermore, its graphics are much cruder than the American version: in <b>track</b> <b>crossings,</b> there are no visible bridges or elevation effects. This version does not feature Petty nor any No Fear branding.|$|R
50|$|Prendergast {{surrendered}} at Des Plaines Street {{police station}} thirty minutes later. He {{still had the}} gun in his possession. When interviewed by police, he gave varying stories as to his motive, including the failed appointment and the mayor's failure to elevate train <b>track</b> <b>crossings.</b> The smell of burned powder and empty chambers reaffirmed the police department of his actions.|$|R
50|$|Until 1930, two Bavarian Class D XI (later DRG Class 98.4-5) steam {{locomotives}} {{handled the}} work, supplemented occasionally by a D VII (DRG Class 98.76). The {{nature of the}} route {{and the quality of}} the track only permitted a top speed of 30 km/h. In summer 1921 three trains ran in each direction daily. The evening train needed 99 minutes, which equated to an average speed of just 16.7 km/h. At <b>track</b> <b>crossings</b> the train could only proceed at 15 km/h and, in some cases, just 10 km/h, ringing its bell as a warning.|$|R
50|$|Italy has 11 rail border {{crossings}} over the Alpine mountains with her neighbouring countries: six are designated as mainline tracks and two are metre-gauge tracks. The six mainline {{border crossings}} are: two with France (one for Nice and Marseille; {{the other for}} Lyon and Dijon), two with Switzerland (one for Brig, Bern and Geneva; the other for Chiasso, Lugano, Lucerne and Zürich), and two with Austria (one for Innsbruck; the other for Villach, Graz and Vienna). The two metre-gauge <b>track</b> <b>crossings</b> are located at the border town of Tirano (enters Switzerland's Canton Graubünden/Grisons) and Domodossola (enters Switzerland's Locarno).|$|R

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower <b>level</b> <b>tracks</b> were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower <b>level</b> <b>tracks</b> and the upper <b>level</b> <b>tracks</b> have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|R
50|$|The line {{crossed the}} Myrtle Avenue Elevated at grade two blocks south of its merge with the Brooklyn Elevated. On its {{second day of}} operation, November 6, a Hudson Avenue train crashed into a Myrtle Avenue train. Service was {{suspended}} immediately, and did not resume until June 22, 1889, when an extension south to Third Street was completed, and a new connection into Myrtle Avenue opened, taking trains between Third Street and Sands Street {{at the end of}} the Myrtle Avenue Elevated, and replacing the four <b>track</b> <b>crossings</b> with one. The unused two blocks north of Myrtle Avenue were placed back in service on December 9, 1889, when Myrtle Avenue trains began to use it to reach Fulton Ferry via the old Brooklyn Elevated.|$|R
50|$|A refuge loop {{built on}} the ruling grade on Cowan bank proved to be {{unworkable}} as the refuged train could not restart. This lesson was learned at Dombarton, where the uphill trains restart from <b>level</b> <b>track.</b> A refuge siding at Razorback halfway up the 1 in 75 ruling grade climb from Fish River to Cullerin also allowed trains to restart from <b>level</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Railway Troops {{were first}} {{established}} August 6, 1851 {{by order of}} Emperor Nicholas I. In accordance with the document [...] "Regulations on the Management of St. Petersburg - Moscow railway" [...] was formed by 14 separate military-workers, 2 and 1 conductor's telegraphic company. The total number reached 4340 people. The task of the first military railway units was to support the working conditions of railway <b>tracks,</b> <b>crossings,</b> bridges, and their protection. Railroad {{became part of the}} Corps of Engineers since its inception in 1870. First, in the form of train teams, and since 1876 - railroad battalions. Railway formed part of the Corps of Engineers until 1908 inclusive. They were then isolated in a separate category and are subject to military service messages (VOSO) of the General Staff.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{commencement}} of services on the standard gauge track in 1938, the number of road and <b>track</b> <b>crossings</b> and thus the danger of accidents were markedly reduced despite the increasing road traffic, but the Niederschlottwitz-Glashütte section was not accessible until April 1939. The flood risk also declined due to the raising of the line, although not on all sections of the line. However, {{the creation of a}} profitable basis for freight transport and improvements in passenger services were more important. For Deutsche Reichsbahn, the railway was the [...] "new gateway to the eastern Ore Mountains", which made the Altenberg winter sport region [...] "a sports ground at the gates of the national capital". The travel time for passenger services was shortened significantly, Altenberg was approximately 70 minutes from Dresden, about 160 minutes from Leipzig and about 180 minutes from Berlin.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a integrated solution to track multiple non-rigid objects (pedestrians) in a multiple cameras system with ground-plane trajectory prediction and occlusion modelling. The resulting system {{is able to}} maintain the tracking of pedestrians before, during and after occlusion. Pedestrians are detected and segmented using a dynamic background model combined with motion detection and brightness and color distortion analysis. Two <b>levels</b> of <b>tracking</b> have been implemented: the image <b>level</b> <b>tracking</b> and the ground-plane <b>level</b> <b>tracking.</b> Several target cues are used to disambiguate between possible candidates of correspondence in the tracking process: spacial and temporal estimation, color and object height. A simple and robust solution for image occlusion monitoring and grouping management is described. Experiments in tracking multiple pedestrians in a dual camera setup with common field of view are presented. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the results of the testing of the recent {{improvements}} made to the two-phase <b>level</b> <b>tracking</b> model in RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. The level model was originally developed during the development of the TRAC-BWR computer code and was subsequently modified by the Pennsylvania State University (PSU). The modifications developed at PSU concern the way in which the two-phase level is moved from volume to volume as the thermal-hydraulic conditions in the system being simulated change during the course of a transients. The other components in the <b>level</b> <b>tracking</b> model remain as described in the original implementation of the model...|$|R
