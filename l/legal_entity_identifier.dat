40|$|Abstract. The {{generation}} of <b>entity</b> <b>identifiers</b> {{is a key}} issue {{in the context of}} semantic web technologies. <b>Entity</b> <b>identifiers</b> are needed when we perform any kind of operation (e. g., reference, match, disambiguation) on entities. In this paper, we present a methodology for generating <b>entity</b> <b>identifiers</b> which can be well integrated in the Entity Name System of the OKKAM infrastructure: a system for managing <b>entity</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Our approach is based on a known labelling scheme for directed acyclic graphs. Unlike other related approaches, it allows {{to keep track of the}} lineage of an entity over the operations of creation, merge of entities, and split of a single entity. This feature is important in a identifier generation framework because it can allow both local deprecation detection between two entities, as well as the reconstruction of the origin of an entity partially described in different sources (i. e., knowing which entity attributes are coming from which sources). ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>entities</b> play an {{important}} role in our society. Many social and economic activities are carried out by organizations which are <b>legal</b> <b>entities,</b> generally under public or private law. The existence of such <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> raises several questions, such as who can be held responsible or liable if the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> activities violate a legal standard. In principle the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> is liable for the consequences of its actions. However, a <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> is itself incapable of physical action; its actions can always be traced back to those of human beings. This thesis examines the circumstances in which the managers of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> under private and public law can be held liable if the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> activities are punishable, cause loss to a third party and/or contravene administrative standards. After all, managers are responsible for the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> affairs. Executives may cause the violation of legal standards by their own actions, but they may also be accused of having failed to provide adequate supervision or having failed to prevent or stop others (subordinates or fellow managers) acting in such a way that legal standards were violated. Moreover, the executive's formal and/or actual position of power may mean that he or she must ensure that the violation is reversed or that the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> complies with the legal standard. In such cases the executive's liability can be regarded as secondary liability, since it is the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> itself which has broken the law; in other words, the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> has the primary liability. ...|$|R

50|$|The prefix {{portion of}} the UTI code should be a unique code for the code issueing authority.

LEI codes are used across the {{financial}} reporting regimes in the U.S. (Dodd-Frank) and Europe (EMIR / MiFID). However, the LEI code length of 20 characters represented a problem for many systems, which in practice limited the usable prefix length to 10 characters.
