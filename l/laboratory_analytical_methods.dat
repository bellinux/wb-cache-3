40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is {{a complex}} {{disorder}} for which currently there is no accepted definition. Although several groups are working on developing and validating biomarkers of kidney injury and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the proposed diagnostic criteria from the Acute Kidney Injury Network are based on an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0. 3 mg/dl (≥ 26. 4 μmol/l), a percentage increase in serum creatinine ≥ 50 % (1. 5 -fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria < 0. 5 ml/kg per hour for more than 6 hours) [1]. A recent report from the Laboratory Working Group of the National Kidney Disease Education Program, however, recommends that serum creatinine alone {{should not be used}} to assess the GFR or to detect the presence of kidney disease because it is affected by the GFR and by factors independent of the GFR, including age, sex, race, body size, diet, certain drugs, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> [2].

40|$|Cikapundung River is {{the main}} river that located {{in the middle of}} Bandung City. It has {{polluted}} water due to the surrounding condensed houses and domestic-non domestic activity. The changing of the discharge pattern due to the climate uncertainty makes the difficulty to perform the river quality assessment. One method to assess the river water quality is by means of simulation results of a model verified with the measurement data obtained from in the field. Modeling is a method that is easy, inexpensive, and saves time. The use of river quality model is very useful to predict the future condition using kinds of scenarios, so that the river environmental management can be formulated prior to the occurrence of pollution, environmental damage, or other disasters. Modeling of river water quality was introduced by Steeter Phelps equation using oxygen depletion curve equation (oxygen sag curve) which is using coefficients, i. e. deoxygenation rate and reaeration rate. These rates are environmental condition depended values; therefore the specific research to find the suitable rates is needed. Furthermore, to make simulation simpler, the development of software of river water quality model is necessary. The ‘KUALA. V 0 1 ’, software to simulate BOD and DO of river water is now being designed enriched with local water characteristic. Laboratory analysis was conducted to obtain the deoxygenation rate.

30|$|With {{regards to}} the fluid-flow {{parameters}} (ɸ and K) in the three formations, the reservoir facies of the Nyalau Formation appear to be of better quality {{than those of the}} Belait and Lambir formations. Differences in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> adopted for the determination of porosity and permeability in the threesome, however, hinders empathic conclusion in this regard. Estimated 20 %, 75 %, and 50 % of the reservoir facies in the Nyalau, Belait, and Lambir formations yielded low poro-perm values (ɸ < 10 %; K[*]<[*] 0.1 md) that justify their classifications as tight reservoir (Zou et al. 2012; Gao and Li 2016). Tight reservoirs are characterized by intricate pore structure and strong heterogeneity owing to the far-reaching influence of diagenetic alterations since their deposition (Lai et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2018). Complete reliance of all available poro-perm data on outcrop samples strongly suggests that relatively high porosity and permeability values observed in the Nyalau Formation may have been influenced by weathering. This is further substantiated by the presence of hematitic cementation (Fig.  12 c). Hence, notable variation in subsurface porosity and permeability is anticipated, owing to the effects of compaction created by overburden loads. Compaction significantly decreases the initial porosity (Paxton et al. 2002). It typically involves two stages; the mechanical compaction and chemical compaction/ pressure dissolution. The former involves grain rearrangement, breakdown of micaceous minerals and soft fragments, as well as evolution of pseudomatrix (Freiburg et al. 2016). The petrographic images in Fig.  12 showcase the evidences of mechanical compaction such as occurrences of long grain contacts (Fig.  12 a, f), grain fracturing (Fig.  12 b, d), development of authigenic minerals (Fig.  12 e), quartz overgrowth (Fig.  12 b, e), and quartz cementation (Fig.  12 e) in the reservoirs sandstone of the onshore central Sarawak. Though with limited coverage, these diagenetic evidences (Fig.  12) are dominantly potential contributors to porosity and permeability loss. Broken grains and feldspar dissolution (Fig.  12 f) may, however, be potential poro-perm enhancers.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{nutrition}} {{of dairy}} cattle. A review. Energy {{is a subtle}} term and {{is defined as the}} capacity for doing a work. In dairy cattle nutrition, feeds have that capacity and the work is the maintenance of the cow, milk production and reproduction. About 75 % of dry matter consumed by the cow is used by the organism to generate and meet its energy requirements. Tropical grasses are characterized by having low or medium energy levels, so energy supplementation of animals grazing tropical grasses requires special attention in order to get good production levels. Energy contents of grasses are difficult to estimate and {{it is not possible to}} do it through regular <b>laboratory</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>methods.</b> However, lineal equations based on the ADF content of forages are frequently used to achieve this goal, as well as mechanistic models using different chemical fractions of forages. Cows experience a negative energy balance during the first trimester of lactation, which is compensated by energy body reserves mobilization. A cow can produce 8 to 10 kg of milk from the energy supplied by a kg of adipose tissue, or an average of 636 kg per each unit of body condition score. Milk production from each unit of body condition score follows an exponential trend, hence the importance of a proper body condition at calving. Adipose tissue mobilization as well as low feed intake during early lactation makes fresh cows more tolerant to heat stress. To have a good production cycle, cows should begin their lactation with a body condition score of 3. 5, then this will drop to 2. 5 by the time of first insemination. As lactation proceeds, cows should begin to replenish their energy and fat reserves to the point where they have a body score of 3 and remain at this score or near throughout the majority of lactation. In late lactation animals should gain weight to be dried off at 3. 5. If a cow calves in a poor body condition (< 3), or her energy nutrition is optimal during early lactation, she will suffer a severe negative energy balance, which will limit her to produce as much milk as the dietary energy will allow. Moreover, she will be more susceptible to metabolic diseases such as ketosis and delays in returning to ovarian activity. Likewise, when animals are over conditioned during late lactation and calve with a body condition score of 4 or higher, they are predisposed to suffer metabolic imbalances such as ketosis or displaced abomasum and severe reproductive problems during the peripartu...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{established}} relationship between salt intake {{and risk of}} high blood pressure (BP). High blood pressure (hypertension) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and scientific evidence shows that a high salt intake can {{contribute to the development of}} elevated blood pressure. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommend a target reduction in the average salt intake of the population to no more than 6 g per day. This figure has been adopted by the UK government as the recommended maximum salt intake for adults and children aged 11 years and over. Following publication of the SACN report in 2003, the government began a programme of reformulation work with the food industry aimed at reducing the salt content of processed food products. Voluntary salt reduction targets were first set in 2006, and subsequently in 2009, 2011 and 2014, for a range of food categories that contribute the most to the population’s salt intakes. Population representative urinary sodium data were collected in England in 2005 - 06, 2008 (UK), 2011 and 2014. In the latest survey assessment, estimated salt intake of adults aged 19 to 64 years in England was assessed from 24 -hour urinary sodium excretion of 689 adults, selected to be representative of this section of the population. Estimated salt intake was calculated using the equation 17. 1 mmol of sodium = 1 g of salt and assumes all sodium was derived from salt. The data were validated as representing daily intake by checking completeness of the urine collections by the para-amino benzoic acid (PABA) method. Urine samples were collected over five months (May to September) in 2014, concurrently with a similar survey in Scotland. This report presents the results for the latest survey assessment (2014) and a new analysis of the trend in estimated salt intake over time. The trend analysis is based on data for urinary sodium excretion from this survey and previous sodium surveys (including data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP) Years 1 to 5) carried out in England over the last ten years, between 2005 - 06 and 2014. This data has been adjusted to take account of biases resulting from differences between surveys in <b>laboratory</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> used for sodium.

40|$|Inhaled anesthetics used in {{hospital}} surgeries are typically volatile halogenated hydrocarbons. Very {{few of them}} are absorbed or metabolized by the patient during use, and, therefore, most of the exhaled gases are collected in the exhaust system and emitted directly to the environment, where they contribute to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. This research focuses on a capture and treatment system for the common anesthetic gases (Isoflurane, Sevoflurane and Desflurane) which includes the capture of these compounds {{in addition to their}} recovery by regeneration in a form that can possibly be re-used {{in hospital}}s or manufacture. The first step in this research was the development of appropriate quantification methods using a gas chromatograph and an FTIR instrument for accurate measurement of the concentrations in batch and continuous flow systems, respectively. In developing a capture system, activated carbon, molecular sieves, and other adsorbents were tested in different batch experiments using several of the most common anesthetic compounds. The activated carbon Norit A 48 (with 100 % adsorption efficency) was 1. 5 to 4 times more efficient at absorbing the halothane than either the polyethylene (25 %), the molecular sieve 4 A (38 %), the industrial white adsorbent (57 %), and the silica gel (63 %) at room temperature. It was similar in adsorption capacity to the Activated Carbon RB 40 M (99. 8 %), the Activated Carbon Vapure 410 (98. 8 %), the Molecular Sieve 13 X (96 %), and the Sigma Activated Carbon (87 %). The GAC 48 (96. 5 %) was 1. 8 to 2 times more efficient at absorbing the Isoflurane than the industrial white adsorbent (41 %), and the silica gel (51 %) at room temperature. Isoflurane with intial volumes of 50, 100, 150 and 200 µl were adsorbed by GAC A 48 with 98. 8, 96. 5, 74. 5, and 64. 1 % efficiency, respectively, after 120 minutes. In addition, sevoflurane with intial volumes of 50, 100, 150 and 200 µl were captured By GAC A 48 with 99. 0, 72. 6, 65. 3, and 50. 4 % efficiency in the same time. Therefore, GAC A 48 was selected as the best adsorbent for capturing both Isoflurane and Sevoflurane with the same adsorption rate at room temperature. Adsorption isotherms were measured for activated carbon and a selection of different anesthetics. In order to account for all the factors in the adsorption process at the hospital, the effects of other parameters such as temperature, gas mixing, initial concentration, and humidity were tested. TGA (thermal gravimetric analysis) was used to confirm that complete desorption was possible in the batch system. Before the industrial set up was tested, a flow through system with air as the carrier gas was designed in the laboratory to closely simulate the expected hospital emissions. Satisfactory results obtained in the laboratory were followed with the installation of a tank containing the best adsorbent connected to a hospital emission system. When the tank carbon bed reached its saturation point after three weeks, desorption proceeded in two steps: “depressurization” and “ heated desorption”. Desorbed amounts of anesthetic in the depressurization step were negligible in comparison with the amounts collected in the heated desorption step in which a tank of activated carbon was heated while air was passed through it. The condensation of desorbed anesthetics was successfully performed in two stages: the removal of water and the condensation of desorbed anesthetics in in a flask and a coil that were both immersed in dry ice. The temperature of the dry ice was at least - 78 °C. Analysis of the condensate in the second stage confirmed the capture of relatively pure sevoflurane and desflurane. A white solid and a little oily liquid by-product were detected during the desorption process that could not be accurately identified by using available <b>laboratory</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>methods.</b> The anesthetic gas absorption results using a tank of activated carbon at the hospital illustrates that the optimal adsorbent could adsorb anesthetics at about 25 % of its initial weight, although some break-through happened before the saturation point was reached. The main recommendations arising from these experiments include: Installing an online tank heating system to enhance the desorption of the anaesthetic gas collection system; and designing a heat exchanger system for effective condensation of the anesthetic gases after the desorption process...|$|E

40|$|When {{the human}} genome project started, the major {{challenge}} was how to sequence a 3 billion letter code in an organized and cost-effective manner. When completed, the project had laid the foundation for a huge variety of biomedical fields through the production of a complete human genome sequence, but also had driven the development of <b>laboratory</b> and <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> that could produce large amounts of sequencing data cheaply. These technological developments made possible the sequencing of many more vertebrate genomes, which have been necessary for the interpretation of {{the human genome}}. They have also enabled large-scale studies of vertebrate genome evolution, as well as comparative and human medicine. In this review, we give examples of evolutionary analysis using a wide variety of time frames-from the comparison of populations within a species to the comparison of species separated by at least 300 million years. Furthermore, we anticipate discoveries related to evolutionary mechanisms, adaptation, and disease to quickly accelerate in the coming years. Paid Open Access</p...|$|R
40|$|From 1991 to 1997, nine intercomparison {{exercises}} on rainwater and freshwater {{samples were}} held {{in the framework of}} an activity connecting laboratories participating in different projects (Environmental studies in the Mediterranean basin, Italian network for the study of wet deposition, Acidification of mountain lakes, Limnological studies of Lake Léman, Monitoring of atmospheric deposition in forests). The number of participants increased from 72 in 1991 to 177 in 1997. Among the measured variables (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions and nutrients), Ca, Mg, Na, K, ammonium, sulphate, chloride and nitrate are considered in this paper. The methods commonly used by the laboratories involved in the exercises are compared for precision, and an estimate of the performance of each method at different concentrations is made. The results show that some of the participating <b>laboratories</b> use <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> which are not reliable for the concentration values occurring in freshwater and/or in rainwater. However, outliers are also produced by laboratories using well-performing methods, indicating the importance of introducing analytical control procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many fungi are {{pathogenic}} {{on plants}} and cause significant damage in agriculture and forestry. They are {{also part of}} the natural ecosystem and {{may play a role in}} regulating plant numbers/density. Morphological identifi-cation and analysis of plant pathogenic fungi, while im-portant, is often hampered by the scarcity of discrimina-tory taxonomic characters and the endophytic or incon-spicuous nature of these fungi. Molecular (DNA se-quence) data for plant pathogenic fungi have emerged as key information for diagnostic and classification studies, although hampered in part by non-standard <b>laboratory</b> practices and <b>analytical</b> <b>methods.</b> To facilitate current and future research, this study provides phylogenetic syn-opses for 25 groups of plant pathogenic fungi in the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucormycotina (Fungi) ...|$|R
40|$|Commission Recommendation 2007 / 196 /EC of 28 March 2007 [] {{recommends}} Member States {{to perform}} monitoring {{on the presence}} of furan in foodstuffs that have undergone heat treatment. The data collected will be used for a risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at a later stage. During the discussions on the Commission Recommendation, Member States have emphasised that the analytical determination of furan remains difficult due to the volatility of this substance. In response to this, the Institute for Reference Materials {{which is part of the}} European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC-IRMM) conducted a survey among European food control <b>laboratories</b> on <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> applied for the determination of furan in food. The survey was conducted in order to evaluate comparability of the analysis protocols, to highlight potential pitfalls and to provide support to laboratories that are new in that field. This report summarises the information supplied by 28 laboratories, identifies common features, and issues that need special attention. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|R
40|$|Models {{describing}} {{water and}} transport {{processes in the}} vadose zone require information on soil hydraulic properties. Currently there exist many <b>laboratory,</b> field and <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> to determine the highly non-linear relations between soil water content, soil water conductivity and soil water pressure head. This paper presents results of the comparison of three different methods, {{used to determine the}} soil hydraulic conductivity function, K(h). A tension infiltrometer was used to measure steady state infiltration rates of the topsoil at three heads, h, resulting in estimates of K(h). Multistep outflow experiments and inverse modelling were performed to optimise the parameters of the soil hydraulic functions. The results of the inverse modelling were than compared with those of commonly used Mualem Van Genuchten method and tension infiltrometer measurements...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of stray-light suppression in the white-light channel of the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer experiment for the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is reported. The white-light channel {{consists of a}} reflecting telescope with external and internal occultation and a polarimeter section. <b>Laboratory</b> tests and <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> are used to perform the analysis. The various stray-light contributions are classified in two main categories: the contribution from sunlight that passes directly through the entrance aperture and the contribution of sunlight that is diffracted by {{the edges of the}} entrance aperture. Values of the stray-light contributions from various sources and the total stray-light level for observations at heliocentric heights from 1. 4 to 5 solar radii are derived. Anticipated signal-to-stray-light ratios are presented together with the effective stray-light rejection by the polarimeter, demonstrating the efficacy of the stray-light suppression design...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} micro-extraction of aqueous samples {{coupled with}} gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode (GC/MS-SIM) {{was developed to}} selectively analyze for 1, 4 -dioxane with low part-per-billion detection sensitivity. Recoveries of 1, 4 -dioxane ranged from 93 % to 117 % for both spiked laboratory reagent water and natural groundwater matrices, the later having elevated organic carbon content (8. 34 ± 0. 31 mg/L as total organic carbon). We observed that freezing the aqueous sample along with the extraction solvent enhanced the extraction efficiency, minimized physical interferences, and improved sensitivity resulting in a limit of detection for 1, 4 -dioxane to approximately 1. 6 µg/L. This method substantially reduces the labor, time, reagents and cost, and uses instruments that are commonly found in <b>analytical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> This <b>method</b> requires a relatively small sample volume (200 µL), and {{can be considered a}} green <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> as it minimizes the use of toxic solvents and the associated laboratory wastes...|$|R
40|$|The {{adulteration}} of raw heparin (Hep) with {{a synthetic}} oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) {{not found in}} nature produced in 2007 - 2008 a global crisis giving rise {{to the development of}} additional, new and specific methods for its quality assurance and purity. In this study, a simple and sensitive agarose-gel electrophoresis method has been developed for the visualization of OSCS in Hep samples along with other natural glycosaminoglycans possibly present as "process-related impurities", in particular dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). Agarose-gel electrophoresis under non-conventional conditions is able to separate OSCS from Hep with its two components, the slow-moving and fast-moving species, DS and CS by performing separation for 15 h (overnight) and under high voltage (100 mA, ∼ 200 V). Densitometric scanning enabled us to calculate a limit of detection of ∼ 0. 5 μg OSCS with a linear behaviour from 0. 1 to 5 μg, comparable to CS/DS. Contaminated samples from Hep manufacturers were analyzed and quantitative data were found comparable to previous studies. Due to its capacity to process many samples in a single run and to the equipment commonly available in <b>laboratories,</b> this <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> would be suitable for the identification and quantification of contamination by other polysaccharides, in particular OSCS and DS, within Hep preparations and formulations...|$|R
