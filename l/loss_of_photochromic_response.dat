40|$|The work {{described}} in this research entailed the preparation and studies <b>of</b> <b>photochromic</b> dendritic compounds with irradiation wavelength dependent properties and dendritic liquid crystalline compounds with <b>photochromic</b> <b>response.</b> <b>Photochromic</b> dendrons comprised <b>of</b> varying polar head groups and a dendritic shell of long alkyl chains were studied at both the air-water and air-solid interfaces. At the air-water interface, only an optimal balance between {{the areas of the}} polar head groups and the dendritic shells results in observable and significant photomechanical response. At the air-solid interface, all the dendrons formed smooth monolayers with <b>photochromic</b> <b>response</b> with the bulky dendritic shell prohibiting aggregation. Within the monolayers, the molecules are in a tilted molecular orientation. Thermotropic properties of small molecule and multi-photochromic dendrimers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarized optical microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Dendritic azobenzene acids showed a propensity to form mesophases at higher generations. In the multi-photochromic dendrimers, the nonlinear tris(azobenzene) s formed hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline phases in the zeroth and first generation with a possible nematic phase observed in the second generation. The zeroth generation linear tris(azobenzene) formed a smectic phase with a tilt angle of 36 ° and a sandy mosaic texture. Bragg spacings in the low angle region of the X-ray diffraction of the first generation indicated a columnar hexagonal liquid crystalline phase whereas the second generation linear dendrimer has 1 sharp peak indicative of a possible nematic phase. Spectroscopic studies indicate 2 wavelengths of maximum absorption for the linear dendrimers at 350 nm and 313 nm respectively. However, the wavelength of irradiation did not impact the rates of thermal back isomerization. In comparing the linear and nonlinear series, the arrangement of the azobenzenes within the dendritic framework (radial vs linear) had no effect on the rates of back isomerization as all the rates were within an order of magnitude of each other. No generational effects were observed in either types of tris(azobenzene) s. The average activation energy for the linear series was 21. 8 kcal/mol and 20. 5 kcal/mol for the nonlinear. Isomerization of both linear and nonlinear dendrimers leads to smaller hydrodynamic volumes. The largest decrease in volume occurred in the zeroth generation in both series. The linear dendrimers decreased in hydrodynamic volume upon irradiation at both 331 nm and 350 nm with the greatest change occurring under 350 nm irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Photorefractivity is the {{modulation}} of {{index of}} refraction due to nonuniform illumination, and numerous applications have been demonstrated utilizing this nonlinear optical property. However, commercial production is seriously impeded by the inability to produce bulk material with the homogeneity of opto-electronic properties that is required for device applications. Bismuth Silicate, Bi 12 SiO 20, (BSO) is a photorefractive material with outstanding properties including a fast response time and high sensitivity is studied. Its photorefractivity {{is due to a}} native defect whose exact nature and origin have not been unambiguously determined. Motivation for current research arose from unexplained optical variations observed in BSO that implicate convective interference as playing a role in native defect formation. Microgravity growth experiments are proposed in order to establish a controlled, convection-free environment to study the origin and nature of the critical native defect. This work aims at resolving critical aspects of performing quantitative microgravity growth experiments that include the interaction of BSO melts with its confinement material; development and characterization of a vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger growth system with a quantifiable, reproducible, and controllable thermal environment; and Bridgman-Stockbarger growth experiments. A comparative analysis of crystals was done in order to establish the relationship between variations in opto-electronic properties as a function of changes in growth conditions. Wetting experiments revealed the sessile drop method to be inappropriate for the BSO-platinum system due to grain boundary pinning. No fundamental difference between the wetting behavior in a terrestrial and a low gravity environment was observed. (cont.) Results from the comparative analysis indicate a lower defect concentration in Bridgman-Stockbarger material as compared to Czochralski material. The ambient atmosphere during processing and high temperature annealing was found affect material response, including removal <b>of</b> the <b>photochromic</b> <b>response</b> and decrease <b>of</b> carrier lifetime. The lack of the critical defect in hydrothermal BSO, and its existence in all melt grown material indicates that the melt plays a fundamental role in its formation. Clustering in the melt is implicated in the literature from nonlinear melt properties. It is therefore hypothesized that these clusters in the melt act as precursors for native defect formation and subject to gravitationally induced convection.
