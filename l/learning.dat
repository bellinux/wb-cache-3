25|$|Connected <b>learning</b> {{has been}} a term used in {{research}} since the early 1990s. The original usages piggybacked {{on the concept of}} , which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected <b>learning</b> in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork or internships which is tied to the concept of <b>learning</b> in context. The early research that used the term connected <b>learning</b> also shared the common theme of sociality being important to <b>learning</b> outcomes. From 2000, the term connected <b>learning</b> began to be used in research publications to refer variously to project-based, networked, social, and information-age <b>learning.</b>|$|E

25|$|As part of {{the final}} {{right-sizing}} plan approved by the Board in February 2006, eight of the poorer performing schools were transformed into Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academies (ALAs). The eight schools were: Arlington Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (K8, two campuses), Colfax Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (K8), Fort Pitt Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (Elementary), Martin Luther King Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (K8), Murray Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (K8), Northview Accelerated <b>Learning</b> Academy (Elementary), A.

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for <b>learning,</b> is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining <b>learning</b> goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery <b>learning,</b> an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} <b>learning</b> objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery <b>learning</b> with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing <b>learning</b> outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal <b>learning</b> goal is expanded into a hierarchy of <b>learning</b> objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E
