40|$|The Rudăriei Gorges, {{named after}} the Rudărica rivulet, {{is close to the}} Eftimie Murgu village, also known by the name of Rudăria. It is located in {{south-west}} Romania, Caras-Severin County, Almăjului Depression. It is known both in Romania and abroad less for its flora, fauna and landscape features and most for its mill reserve, where water mills are still used by the natives. The paper has as purpose, establishment of forest habitats in the area of ​​research. At the same time the work wants to clarify inconsistencies on the types of forest habitats reported to be present in accordance with the Standard Form of the site of community importance ROSCI 0032 and habitats identified in the field. The methodology is specific to the identification and characterization of habitats. Field survey (during vegetation, March-October) showed that the vegetation in the area was mosaic-like, which hindered habitat mapping. Moreover, we have noticed differences between the habitats mentioned for the area (Standard Form) and those identified in the field. Thus, the Standard Form of ROSCI 0032 Cheile Rudăriei mentions as existing in the area the habitat 91 K 0 - Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forests (Aremonio-Fagion), but in the field there were found no species representative for this type of habitat. According to our studies, the beech forests in the Rudăriei Gorges are part of the Habitat 9110 - <b>Luzulo-Fagetum</b> <b>beech</b> <b>forests.</b> Other new habitats described in the area and not mentioned in the Standard Form are 91 E 0 * - Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (Alno-Padion, Alnion incanae, Salicion albae); 91 M 0 – Pannonian-Balkanic turkey oak – sessile oak forests.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the distribution of soil mite populations (Acari: Gamasina) from several terrestrial ecosystems, some of them little studied in Romania {{as well as in}} Europe. We studied the Gamasina communities in seven ecosystem types from the Doftana Valley, Prahova County: <b>Luzulo-Fagetum</b> <b>beech</b> forest; Medio-European limestone <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> of the Cephalanthero-Fagion; Pannonic woods with Quercus petraea and Carpinus betulus; Galio-carpinetum oak - hornbeam forests; Alpine rivers and their ligneous vegetation with Myricaria germanica; alluvial shrub, characteristic for a hilly-mountain area, with Salix purpurea; adjacent area to an inland cliff ecosystem. A total of 240 soil samples, 63 species and 475 individuals were analysed. The samples were taken from May 2006 till September 2010. The highest numerical abundance and species diversity was found in the area located nearby to an inland cliff, which is an early succession stage ecosystem. Considering the dominance and constancy indices quantified for mites from all investigated areas, the highest percent was recorded by the recedent-subrecedent and accessory-accidental species. Based on similarity index two different characteristic groups of gamasid populations were delimited: one for deciduous forests and one for shrubs.

40|$|The Slavonianmountains have an {{important}} place in the floristic and vegetation picture of the continental part of Croatia. For the most part, the forest cover of this region consists of common beech stands (Fagus sylvatica L.). Many authors have worked on defining plant communities of common beech {{in the northern part}} of Croatia in the last ten years. Even though this has greatly contributed to get a better understanding of them,many questions have remained open. This is so because the research wasmostly conducted on smaller geographical scale where local conditions (specific microhabitat, anthropogenic influences, etc.) significantly affected the phytosociological analyses. On the other hand, it is rather difficult to carry out the analyses on a larger geographical scale because many regions and/or vegetative types are still scarcely covered by relevés. The goal of this study is to analyze the floral composition of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, which have not been sufficiently studied so far. The next goal is to define and draw boundaries between plant communities, and also to analyze some of the ecological and phytogeographical features. During field studies of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, 88 relevés were made using central European Braun-Blanquet methodology. The relevés have been compared with the relevés of similar vegetation in the wider geographical region (N Croatia, N Slovenia, S Hungary). The analysis included 1509 published relevés of 13 associations from Slovene Phytosociological Database (Šilc 2006) and Croatian database of forests vegetation (Krstonošić et al. 2007) – Lamio orvale-Fagetum, Cardamine savensi-Fagetum, Isopyro-Fagetum, Vicio oroboidi-Fagetum, Hacquetio-Fagetum, Helleboro odori-Fagetum, Carici pilosae-Fagetum, Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum, Galio odorati-Fagetum, Polysticho setiferi-Fagetum, Luzulo-Fagetum, Castaneo-Fagetum i Blechno-Fagetum. The numerical analysis of the floral composition was made (cluster analysis, NMDS), as well as the analysis of ecological variables (DCA). To describe ecological conditions, Ellenberg’s indicator values were also used. Clasification was made by cluster analyses in PC-ORD (McCune&Mefford 1999). NMDS was made by R using Vegan (Oksanen et al. 2006) and DCAwas made by CANOCO 4. 02 (Ter Braak and Šmilauer 2002). Slavonian hills are situated in the eastern part of Croatia, on the border of the Pannonian and Illyrian floristic area. The area is bordered by themountains of Papuk (953 ma. s. l.) and Krndija in the north-west and north, and by the mountains of Psunj (989 m a. s. l.), Požeška gora (616 m a. s. l.) and Dilj (471 m a. s. l.) in the south-east and east. The average annual air temperature in the researched area is around 11 °C, and it increases from the west to the east. January is the coldest month of the year, and July is the wormest. The average annual amount of precipitation decreases from the west to the east. The geological structure is quite diverse. Most of the mountain range is made of silicate and sandstone rock, while parts of Papuk and Požeška gora, and most parts of Dilj are made of limestone and marlstone. We have established three associations of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> that can be divided into acidophilic <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> (<b>Luzulo-Fagetum),</b> submountainous <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> (Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum luzuletosum and caricetosum pilosae) and mountainous <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> (Cardamino savensi-Fagetum), (Fig. 2, 3, Tab. 1). Ass. Luzulo luzuloidi-Fagetum This association has already been reported in the study area. These stands are established on acid substrates on steep slopes (Fig. 4, 5). They have very poor floral composition. Furthermore, typical stands are dominated by Luzula luzuloides and this mainly occurs on the northern slopes; there are also stands dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus, which occurs in slightly warmer habitats (cf. Tab. 1 and 2). Ass. Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum In the study region of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, two groups of relevés could be distinguished, even though there is no sharp distinction between them (Fig. 2). A more acidophilic group (subass. luzuletosum), where Festuca drymeia is dominant with a significant presence of Luzula luzuloides, comes in great complexes at higher altitudes and ismore present in the western and northern part of themountains. In the southern and eastern part, it can be found in small patches. The domination of the Carex pilosa is significant for the other group (subass. caricetosum pilosae). It can be found at lower altitudes and it ismore present in the eastern and southern part of themountains. In the floristic sense, it differs from subass. luzuletosum with a greater participation of species such as Carpinus betulus, Quercus petraea, Tilia tomentosa and others. In the area of the association, in the ditches and basins, there is a significant presence of species such as Polystichum setiferum, Dryopteris filix-mas, Acer pseudoplatanus, Sambucus nigra, etc. (Tab. 1, 2, Fig. 3, 4). Having analyzed the submountainous <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in the region of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, the question remains whether there are two associations, or different subassociations within the same association. To solve the status and relationship with the related associations, it is necessary to make a study that will include all submountainous <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in a wider geographical area. The description and systematic position of this association is a topic of much debate in phytosociological literature. We are of the opinion that none of the nomenclature combinations are satisfactory. Ass. Cardamino savensi-Fagetum Beech stands grow in the upper region of Mt. Papuk (over 700 m a. s. l.) and they can be clearly distinguished from all other studied stands by their floral composition. By comparing it with the relevés of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> fromliterature, it has been undeniably established that this was the case of mountainous <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of the suballiance Lamio orvalae-Fagetum. By its floral composition and ecological characteristics, these forests are most similar to those described under the name Cardamino savensi-Fagetum in Slovenia. Slavonian mountains are a region of well-indented relief, where various base soils, soil depths, expositions, etc., occur in a very small space. Consequently, forest plant communities appear in a delicate mosaic of different vegetation types, which often alternate and whose boundaries are usually not clear-cut. The composition of <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> flora of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija, as well as the whole area of Slavonian mountains is characterized by a smaller number of species compared to <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of the Dinarian region and western Croatia. For the most part, some Illyrian species (Lamium orvala, Calamintha grandiflora, Cardamine trifolia, Rhamnus fallax and Euphorbia carniolica) are missing or come up very rarely, which has also been noted in some earlier studies. Sizeable regions of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of Slavonian mountains are still quite inadequately explored from a phytosociological point of view. This is mainly the case with the westernmost and north-easternmost regions (Fig. 1). In order to solve the remaining open questions and to better define plant communities, it is necessary to study these regions as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{state and}} {{silvicultural}} demands in <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of northeast Serbia were {{studied in the}} economic regions of Severni Kučaj, Timok and Južni Kučaj, and {{in the region of}} the National Park Đerdap. The detailed analysis of state forests was performed: representation of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> according to silvicultural form, origin, age structure, stand state and productivity Average volume in high <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of 218 m 3 x ha– 1 is for about 5 % lower than the average in Serbia (207. 2 m 3 x ha– 1), and it amounts to 87 % of the optimal volume of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in Serbia. Volume increment of 4. 5 m 3 ha– 1 is approximate to the average increment of high <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in Serbia, and it amounts to 75 % of the optimal value. The average volume of coppice <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of 150 m 3 ha– 1 is 60 % of the optimal volume of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in Serbia The age structure is unfavourable, because the percentage of well conserved mature stands is only about 8 %. Unplanned regeneration has started on about 15 % of the area. Middle-aged and maturing stands account for more than 3 / 4 of the total area (80 %). Stand state of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in this region can be assessed as close to unsatisfactory, if the criteria are conservation, origin, vitality, and also the health state Based on the above state, the concrete silvicultural demands for each silvicultural situation were determined and the silvicultural measures were proposed aiming at their rational utilisation and improvement of forest state: measures aiming at the establishment of new, quality stands and measures aiming at the improvement of the state of existing forests...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{processes}} can {{be classified}} {{in terms of their}} time scale, their spatial scale, the elements observed, and the degree of human impact. Using these categories the regeneration of the tree layer, the regeneration of the herb layer as well as successional changes of supraregional importance (immissions, global change) are discussed. A virgin (mixed) European <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> consists of a mosaic of sub-stands that can be typified by their structure and developmental stage (phase) of the tree layer; in some phases the tree individuals of each sub-stand are rather even-aged. Natural cyclic regeneration of virgin (mixed) European <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> mainly includes the tree species of the terminal phases, expecially the beech itself. Changes of tree species composition within the cycle are the exception; in European <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> light-demanding pioneers seem to be restricted to rather small patches under natural conditions. In contrast, the sequence (1) felled-area flora, (2) pioneer shrub/pioneer forest and (3) terminal forest is a characteristic feature of managed deciduous forests as a consequence of soil disturbances. During the cyclic regeneration of the tree layer of European <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> the floristic content of the ground layer vegetation does not change fundamentally. Regeneration of many of the ground layer species of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> via generative diaspores is more or less restricted to micro-disturbances. In contrast disturbance of the topsoil and creation of open habitats for the establishment of saplings in the absence of competition is taking place all over a clear-cutting area. European <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> are subject to changes of floristic structure caused by immissions. Especially nitrogen, emitted over decades in large quantities, causes a successive change in floristics: species requiring high amounts of nitrogen are increasing in <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> all over Europe. Most of them are rapidly and tall growing species, outcompeting the slower and smaller growing acid-indicators. Soil acidification, although taking place, is therefore often not reflected in changes in the vegetation cover. Up to now, syntaxonomic changes are usually restricted to the levels below the association. Additionally some proportion of (<b>beech)</b> <b>forest</b> stands are presently changing since the regeneration following the abandonment of degrading land use practices has not yet been completed. As a consequence of changing climatic conditions (CO 2 -content, air temperature, precipitation, storms) it is expected that European <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> will change in the future. However, details of the floristic structure of future <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> communities can not be predicted. Nevertheless, according to present knowledge, <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> will remain the most important natural forests in Europe during the next century...|$|R
50|$|Myrtle <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> cannot survive strong fire, {{and must}} re-establish from {{neighbouring}} areas. They can, however, survive light fires, by regenerating from seed, or sometimes vegetatively from basal epicormic shoots. Generally myrtle <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> only form once a wet sclerophyll forest reaches maturity, taking {{several hundred years}} to do so.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{environment}} characteristics naturally {{affect the}} biogeographical classification of forests in central Europe. However, {{even on the}} same localities, different systems of vegetation classification de-scribe the forest types according to the naturally dominant tree species with different accuracy. A set of 20 representative natural beech stands in the borderland between the Bohemian Massif (Hercyni-an biogeographical subprovince) and the Outer Western Carpathians (Westcarpathian subprovince) was selected in order to compare textural, hydrostatic, physico-chemical and chemical properties of soils between the included geomorphological regions, bioregions and biotopes. Differences in the soils of the surveyed beech stands were mainly due to volume weight and specific weight, maximum capillary capacity (MCC), porosity, base saturation (BS), total soil nitrogen (Nt) and fulvic acids. Specifics in the relations between these soil characteristics indicated that transient trans-Hercynian <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> developed in the borderland between the two compared subprovinces. Soils of the investigated Hercynian <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> were generally characterized by lower BS and lower Nt. Soils of the trans-Hercynian <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> were more similar to the Carpathian <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> soils than soils in the other Hercynian <b>beech</b> <b>forests.</b> Soils of the trans-Hercynian and Carpathian <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> showed similarly higher BS, deeper occurrence of humic substances, lower specific weight and also higher MCC. Higher content of humic substances as well as MCC indicated an equal effect on forest ecology, which may contribute to more accurate classification of forests...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a preliminary system of the <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> vegetation in Hokkaido, Japan. The investigations were performed in the Oshima peninsula where constitutes the northern limlt of distribution of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata Blume). The <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of Japan Sea side type has been systemalized phytosociologically based on our own observations and earlier publications by other authers. In respect to the floristic composition, the <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> in Hokkaido was distinguished significantly from the <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> in Japan Sea side region of Honshu. The composition of the forest showed a floristically transitional aspect between the <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> of Japan Sea side type and broad leaved tree-conifer mixed forest (Pan mix forest zone by Tatewaki 1955) in the main area of Hokkaido. The <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> in Hokkaido has been identified by its floristic composition as association, Saso kurilensis-Fagetum crenatae Suzuki 1949, which might be included in the alliance, Saso-Fagion crenatae. This association was subdivided into the following 6 subassociations and 6 variants which showed special floristic compositions and habitat conditions. A. Dryopteris crassirhizoma subassociation: A-a. Carex dolichostachya var. glaberrima variant, A-b. typical variant. B. Dryopteris austriaca subassociation. C. Typical subassociation. D.
