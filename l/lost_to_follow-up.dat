40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{describe}} the long-term outcome of local amputations and debridements of diabetic feet, with special reference to {{the presence or absence}} of arterial disease. Materials and methods: a consecutive series of 75 diabetic patients having local foot surgery during 1987 – 92 was reviewed in 1998. A total of 136 operations had been done on 92 limbs, of which 52 (60 %) had evidence of arterial disease. Survivors were interrogated in 1998, with follow-up intervals of 69 – 120 (median 92) months after their index operations. Results: complete healing occurred in 48 % feet, and 36 % limbs required major amputation, after 1 day– 7 years (median 24 days). Major amputation was more common in limbs with arterial disease (52 % vs. 18 %) –p;< 0. 001.

In surgical clinical trials, sham surgery serves an analogous purpose to placebo drugs, neutralizing biases such as the placebo effect. A critical review was performed to study the statistical relevance of the clinical trials about sham surgery {{in the light of}} potential confounding factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the critical review 52 articles were included. The possible confounding factors have been studied using a structured interpretative research form designed by the authors. This form includes the following ten confounding factors: I), lack of homogeneity among inclusion/exclusion criteria. II), false double blind. III), lack of post-surgery double blind. IV), power of the study. V), sample characteristics. VI), <b>lost</b> patients <b>to</b> <b>Follow-up.</b> VII), gender distribution. VIII), age equilibrium. IX), lack of psychological patient evaluation. X), lack of psychiatric patient evaluation. In most of the studies, at least one confounding factor was present.
