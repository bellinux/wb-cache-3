500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} if the Simpsons staff <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> {{from the experience of}} having Gervais contribute to the show, Groening said they found out [...] "that we could stay true to The Simpsons sensibility, with high-velocity visual gags, but also honor what Ricky does with subtlety and nuance." [...] Jean added that [...] "there was a scene with Ricky and Julie Kavner , which was longer than scenes we normally do, and slower-paced, but it got a bigger laugh." [...] According to Don Kaplan, writing for the New York Post, Gervais said to a British newspaper in late 2005 {{that as a result of}} working on The Simpsons and other American shows, his connection with American television is deeper than his connection with British television.|$|E

To bolster the [...] "fight your way out" [...] scenario, Chinook helicopters with additional troops would be positioned nearby. Most of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option, but changed his support {{the next day to}} the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.|$|E

500|$|Juster had {{not read}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{when he wrote}} The Phantom Tollbooth, but the two books, each about a bored child plunged {{into a world of}} absurd logic, have {{repeatedly}} been compared. According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, [...] "Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin". Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the Cheshire Cat. The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the Queen of Hearts' arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift. Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of Victorian childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-World War II world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm. His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well—Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll leaves us uncertain if Alice has <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.|$|E

Liz tells Jack that he should find out who his real father is, explaining [...] "If I have <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> from my Sims family: When a child doesn't see his father enough he starts to jump up and down, then his mood level will drop until he pees himself." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Liz and Pete learn from James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) that Tracy's favorite television show is NCIS, a CBS police drama series revolving around special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who conduct criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E

[...] The season 5 {{timeline}} skip, showing {{the characters in}} their lives after high school and college, was successful. It {{is thought to have}} successfully avoided jumping the shark, and viewership returned to an all-time high. Ginia Bellefante of The New York Times, on the other hand, said, [...] "Not one of the newly minted 22-year-olds on One Tree Hill blogs or dresses coolly or speaks cleverly or gives any indication of having <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> at all in college." [...] She characterized the portrayal of twenty-somethings as [...] "so wildly inauthentic and unfamiliar as to make watching it feel like foreign correspondence", but added that [...] "One Tree Hill is a no-arrogance, no-entitlement zone, and I'm (shamefully) happy to pull up and park".

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are certainly going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we <b>learned</b> <b>anything</b> from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll at least get some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner? Strappy awesome three inch stilettos? The possibilities are endless… [...] " ...|$|E
