The auditory signals were presented at the front-right, front-left, rear-right, and rear-left positions from the subjects, whose reaction times and accuracies at different spatial mapping conditions were examined. The results showed a significant spatial stimulus-response compatibility effect in which faster and more accurate responses were obtained in the transversely and longitudinally compatible condition while the worst performance was found when spatial stimulus-response compatibility {{did not exist in}} either orientation. It was also shown that the transverse compatibility effect was found significantly stronger than the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>compatibility</b> effect. The effect of signal position was found significant and post hoc test suggested that the emergent warning alarm should be placed on the front-right position for right-handed users. The warning foreperiod prior to the signal presentation was shown to influence reaction time and a warning foreperiod of 3 s is found optimal for the 2 -choice auditory reaction task...|$|E
