50|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{were constructed}} using frames, typically of wood or steel tubing, which {{could then be}} covered (or skinned) with fabric such as Irish linen or cotton. The fabric made a minor structural contribution in tension but none in compression, and was there for aerodynamic reasons only. By considering the structure {{as a whole and}} not just the sum of its parts, monocoque construction integrated the skin and frame into a single <b>load-bearing</b> <b>shell</b> with significant improvements to strength and weight.|$|E
50|$|The Behlen Manufacturing Company's best-known {{product was}} the {{frameless}} steel building system that it developed in 1950. This system employed deeply corrugated steel panels, {{which could be}} assembled to form a complete <b>load-bearing</b> <b>shell</b> without any supporting frame. In 1955, a Behlen building survived an atomic blast test at Operation Cue in the Nevada desert. This building was put {{on display at the}} 1955 Nebraska State Fair. Behlen buildings can be found all over the United States, as well as in many foreign countries. Behlen's 19 acre facility in Columbus employed some 1100 people at its height. A nationwide network of five hundred builders marketed the company's product.|$|E
50|$|The Deperdussin Monocoque was a {{development}} of an earlier racing aircraft designed by Louis Béchereau which was first flown {{at the end of}} 1911 and was the first aircraft to exceed 100 mph in level flight. This aircraft made partial use of the monocoque technique, with a pair of curved <b>load-bearing</b> <b>shells</b> used in conjunction with a conventional wooden box-girder fuselage.|$|R

50|$|A later {{example is}} the 21-story {{concrete}} shell tower 0-14 in Dubai, UAE (2007), designed by Reiser + Umemoto. The structural shell creates a unique lace-like facade is modulated for variable light and views. The one meter space between the shell and main enclosure creates natural air movement that cools the glass facade. This is a very early example of the environmental design benefits that are achieved by applying the adaptive heuristics of Parametricism. The building's <b>load-bearing</b> concrete <b>shell</b> {{eliminates the need for}} internal columns and load-bearing walls.|$|R

2500|$|The {{relatively}} high {{performance of the}} Il-10 prompted the development by the Ilyushin design bureau of a lighter attack aircraft with greater speed and maneuverability in 1944. The Il-16, as the new design was called, was powered by the new liquid-cooled Mikulin AM-43NV engine that delivered [...] for takeoff. The design of the Il-16 was virtually identical {{to that of the}} Il-10, both aerodynamically and structurally, but it was slightly smaller and weighed less. Coupled with the more powerful AM-43 engine, it was expected that Il-16 would be significantly faster than the older aircraft. It used Ilyushin's typical <b>load-bearing</b> armored <b>shell,</b> but the armor was thinner in comparison to that of the Il-10.|$|R

The thickness of the shell ranged from [...] in thickness. The armored bulkhead protecting the pilot from the front was [...] thick.
