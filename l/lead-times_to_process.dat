40|$|Lean Function Deployment (LFD) was {{developed}} to fill {{the need for a}} method that determines the lean implementation point using customer needs in determining process steps. LFD is a method developed by combining the underlying principles of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and existing lean methods to detect where to implement lean in a process. The LFD methodology is an algorithm using paired comparison and relative rankings between needs, technical characteristics, process parameters, and process steps using input from both the customer and the process engineer. LFD determines the critical-to-quality (CTQ) and the critical <b>to</b> <b>lead-time</b> <b>process</b> steps in the production of a product using 2 phases. LFD ultimately mitigates the problems of QFD by using a consistent and defined ranking system to quantify results. LFD uses a weighting system that connects expected weights for each step of the algorithm. Ultimately, the customer need rankings are tied to the final CTQ process ratings by carrying weights between sub-phases. The effectiveness of the LFD tool was tested among subjects and proved to increase the distinction between ratings for process parameters because it has a decreased range in rankings among subjects. Finally, a computer program {{was developed}} and is available on a Web site to show the real-world application of the proposed lean implementation tool...|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} business environment, quick {{service with}} minimal waiting time {{is an important}} factor for customers when choosing a service. Many service organizations guarantee a uniform <b>lead-time</b> <b>to</b> all customers in order to gain competitive advantages in the market. In selecting a <b>lead-time</b> <b>to</b> quote, the firm has to take into consideration not only how customers will react to the delivery time guarantee, but also whether it has adequate capacity to fulfill the commitment. A short lead-time can bring both benefits and costs. It can increase customer demand, but might require a higher capacity level. We present a mathematical model and a solution method for determining the optimal quoted lead-time and capacity level for a profit-maximizing firm with time-varying and lead-time sensitive demand. The firm incurs convex capacity costs and pays lateness penalties whenever the actual lead-time exceeds the quoted lead-time. A few studies have been conducted on the relationship between uniform lead-time, capacity, demand, and overall profitability. However, none of them takes the time variation of demand into account.

40|$|A {{complete}} power price forecast, spanning various time horizons from intraday to long-term, is commercially and economically beneficial. Although the liquidity of intraday markets has grown substantially {{over the past}} few years, the main focus of research still lies in long-term price forecasting. However, improved modelling of intraday prices enables market players to further optimize their renewable portfolios within day and to generate additional revenues with flexible units. This thesis presents a newly developed method of forecasting intraday power prices for the last trading hours before market closure based on fundamental influencing factors. The method combines mainly Markov chains and regression analysis to predict intraday price movements and includes various parameters which can be modified to model different price scenarios. In order to model the price movements a new continuous time-dependent intraday index is defined and introduced in this thesis. Markov chains are applied to intraday prices to depict stochastic historic price movements. The resulting probability distributions are found to be dependent on the price level and the <b>lead-time</b> <b>to</b> delivery. The Gaussian nature of the distributions indicates that consideration of fundamental factors is necessary to derive the direction of price development. Therefore, regression analysis is applied to model fundamental influencing factors, such as activated control reserve, intraday deviations of renewable production forecasts and demand forecast errors. The highest impact on intraday prices results from the activation of control reserve, which is positively correlated to the prices. Furthermore, the model shows a clear negative correlation between price movements and intraday deviations of wind and solar production forecasts. An impact based on demand forecast errors is not ascertainable. A considerable improvement of the modelling results can be achieved through a combination of multiple fundamental influencing factors. Furthermore, the impact of various model parameters on the intraday price index is shown, such as a variation of the forecast <b>lead-time</b> <b>to</b> the trading period...|$|R
