40|$|Oil-palm shells as an {{agricultural}} waste can be pyrolysed producing gaseous material {{that can be}} condensed into liquid smoke. Redistilled liquid smoke has been proven effective as fresh fish preservative due to its antibacterial activity. In the present study, the redistilled liquid smoke is evaluated as fish preservative of fresh catch and as fly repellent in fish salting-fermenting process. The tests included total volatile base-nitrogen levels in fish muscle and antibacterial activity using agar diffusion method. The content of various organic acids in liquid smoke reached 9. 2 %, mainly consisting of acetic acid and phenolics, at pH of 3. 2. There were no harmful compounds such as tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The redistilled liquid smoke concentrations of 8, 9, and 10 % were able to maintain the freshness of pomfret fish up to 24 h. In these levels of redistilled <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>solution,</b> diameters of clear zone formed on the antibacterial test ranged 10 - 20 mm, meaning that the liquid smoke fell into strong antibacterial category.

The seeds were obtained from a long-unburned Pinus brutia Ten. forest located on the Bozburun peninsula, Muðla, Turkey. Heat treatments were carried out at 80, 100, 120, and 150 °C for five minutes. For smoke treatments, seeds were incubated in a <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>solution</b> for 24 hours. Both dry and watered controls {{were included in the}} experiment for heat and smoke treatments, respectively. Extra treatments of heat and smoke combinations and a cold stratification treatment were also performed.

When compared with the control, the heat shock of 100, 120 and 150 °C had significant stimulatory effects on the germination response, whereas 80 °C, smoke and cold stratification did not. The results of the heat treatments are in accordance with current literature, but there is still a need for more studies for the comparison of the smoke treatment. In summary, the results indicated that seed germination of the considered population of C. creticus is stimulated by moderate and high heat intensities, but not by low heat intensity and smoke.

50|$|The {{application}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of <b>smoke,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of <b>solutions</b> of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous <b>smoke</b> <b>solutions</b> is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.|$|R

Data on chemical and physical qualities were analyzed using analysis of variance (Completely Randomized Design/CRD) with factorial 4 x 3. The sensory properties were analyzed by a non parametric h-test. The results showed that liquid smoke concentration up to 12 % significantly (p< 0. 05) increased water holding capacity and cooking loss of samples.

However, its {{composition}} varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} raw materials used and preparation precedure. <b>Liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> derived from palm oil shell is potential due to the abundance of its byproduct sources in the palm oil industry. This study thus aims to prepare the best fraction of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> that can extend the shelf life of beef meatballs at room temperature. The raw <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> was redistilled at 80, 90, and 100 °C and was used as an ingredient in the beef meatballs production. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identification showed that there were no harmful compounds such as derivatives of tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. <b>Liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> produced from redistillation at 80 °C had the best result for providing higher acid value and lower pH, i. e. 5. 14 % and 2. 26, respectively. The LC 50 value of the redistilled <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> in brine shrimp lethality assay was 0. 16 %. Inhibition zones of 0. 1 and 0. 8 % redistilled <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> on the antibacterial test against Staphylococcus aureus were both 6. 10 mm, while the zones of inhibition for Escherichia coli were 0 and 7. 0 mm, respectively.
