40|$|Bioluminescence, the {{emission}} of visible light by living organism, is mostly {{found in the}} deep ocean where {{it is used to}} avoid or help predation as well as communication between conspecifics. This work is based on the hypothesis that bioluminescence could also be used by predators, here the southern elephant seals (SES), to locate their prey. It has been shown that SES are endowed with a vision adapted to low light intensity with a peak sensitivity at 479 nm, matching not only the wavelength of natural light at depth but also the bioluminescent spectrum of most mesopelagic organisms. <b>Lantern</b> <b>fishes</b> represent the biggest biomass in the southern ocean and are known to be SES’s main prey. In this work, we aimed to reveal that Prey Catch Attempts (PCA) might be related to bioluminescent events. By stimulating the bioluminescence of <b>lantern</b> <b>fishes</b> trawled during Mycto 3 D expedition (MD 197) and by analysing diving behaviour of three satellite-tracked females equipped with high sampling rate Time-Depth-Light 3 D-accelerometers and magnetometers recorders (MK 10 -X and DDT) we were able (i) to link the number of Prey Catch Attempts (PCA), assessed from the processing of accelerometer data, with the number of detected bioluminescence events; (ii) to assess if SES modified trajectory and performed PCA in relation to bioluminescence events; (iii) to measure bioluminescence characteristics of several <b>lantern</b> <b>fishes</b> species. Results revealed that <b>lantern</b> <b>fishes</b> produced a blue luminescence (450 nm) and although PCA could take place in absence of bioluminescence events, we found that PCA was positively related to bioluminescence events which provide strong support that bioluminescence represents a key element in predator-prey interactions...|$|R

5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, <b>lantern</b> <b>fishes,</b> and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|R
40|$|The workshop's primary {{objective}} is to visualize the future possibilities for ocean plastic de-pollution, using plastic disposal to co-create a 3 D gyre installation. It will incorporate joyful activism, trash aesthetics and craft making. The workshop will be a participatory platform, facilitating rather than dictating. It proposes that a changing relation to disposal is a changing relation to oneself. The future aim of this ongoing design research is to co-create new discard values and induce community relation towards urban-ocean plastic waste on a small everyday scale. The process of making and visualizing will be initiated from the <b>lantern</b> <b>fish's</b> {{point of view and}} their mundane entanglement with gyre. Thus this workshop will attempt to socially narrate the quality of everyday life and global progress in more holistic terms than only the economic indicator of GDP or scientific marine data. When we transgress the surplus-driven consumer culture, taking the seemingly useless discarded plastic and transforming it into designed objects and 3 D installations, we reveal how disposed materiality can contain a dimension for spaces of possibility, creating new values and even hope for global de-pollution...|$|R

40|$|In fish {{catching}} activity, {{the fishermen}} in Banyuanyar district use mini tools for catching fish (purse seine) and use light assist tools for an {{operation in the}} night day. The light, that is used, is kerosene pressure lantern and mercury lights or lamp that is used on water surface (surface lamp). This kind of light is used to collect “pelagic” fish that has positive phototaxis characteristic. Puffer fish’s response towards different sourse of light, that’s kerosene pressure lantern and mercury light is needed to be known. Therefore, we can know the source of light that is more effective in order to collect the fish. It is hoped that the productivity of puffer fish will be developed for the fishermen. During the research with ten times repeating, the total account of puffer fish’s haul that is resulted with two different treatment  by using kerosene pressure lantern and mercury light is that 810 kg and 1. 460 kg. The data of puffer fish’s haul that is gotten after using Mann-Whitney test shows that the kerosene pressure lantern and mercury light not to really different, especially in the haul of puffer fish in significant standart (0, 05) is 2, 262, while in Mann-Whitney test account is 0, 171.

50|$|Some of {{the tiniest}} bits of plastic are being {{consumed}} by small fish, {{in a part}} of the pelagic zone in the ocean called the Mesopelagic zone, which is 200 to 1000 metres below the ocean surface, and completely dark. Not much is known about these fish, other than that there are many of them. They hide in the darkness of the ocean, avoiding predators and then swimming to the ocean's surface at night to feed. Plastics found in the stomachs of these fish were collected during Malaspina's circumnavigation, a research project that studies the impact of global change on the oceans. The most popular mesopelagic fish is the <b>lantern</b> <b>fish.</b> It resides in the central ocean gyres, a large system of rotating ocean currents. Since <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> serve as a primary food source for the fish that consumers purchase, including tuna and swordfish, the plastics they ingest become part of the food chain. The <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> is one of the main bait fish in the ocean, and it eats large amounts of plastic fragments, which in turn will not make them nutritious enough for other fish to consume.|$|E
50|$|Warming's <b>lantern</b> <b>fish,</b> Ceratoscopelus warmingii, is a {{lanternfish}} of {{the family}} Myctophidae, found circumglobally in both hemispheres, at depths of between 700 and 1,500 m {{during the day and}} between 20 and 200 m at night.

50|$|The horned <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> {{occurs in}} the Pacific Ocean from Baja California south to the Marquesas Islands and the Gulf of California. Specimens have also been {{captured}} in other locations, including New Guinea, the South China Sea, Venezuela, and the Mozambique Channel, suggesting a wide oceanic distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Specimens were caught at depths from 650 to over 2000 m (2130-6560 ft), while larvae have been recovered {{close to the surface}} to a depth of 35 m.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that there are}} large dietary variations between large and small O. ingens. One {{of the most common}} findings is that juvenile squid (>200 mm ML) consume a greater percentage of crustaceans and cephalopods compared to their size than mature squid, which consume a large percentage of fish and virtually no crustaceans. Globally, however, myctophid fish (<b>lantern</b> <b>fish)</b> are seen as common prey. [...] Larger squid are known to practice cannibalism (accounting for up to 6% of diet).|$|E
50|$|Luminescent {{bacteria}} emit {{light as}} the result of a chemical reaction during which chemical energy is converted to light energy. Luminescent bacteria exist as symbiotic organisms carried within a larger organism, such as many deep sea organisms, including the <b>Lantern</b> <b>Fish,</b> the Angler fish, certain jellyfish, certain clams and the Gulper eel. The light is generated by an enzyme-catalyzed chemoluminescence reaction, wherein the pigment luciferin is oxidised by the enzyme luciferase. The expression of genes related to bioluminescence is controlled by an operon called the lux operon.|$|E
5000|$|Lanternfishes (or myctophids, {{from the}} Greek μυκτήρ myktḗr, [...] "nose" [...] and ophis, [...] "serpent") are small mesopelagic fish {{of the large}} family Myctophidae. One of two {{families}} in the order Myctophiformes, the Myctophidae are represented by 246 species in 33 genera, and are found in oceans worldwide. They are aptly named after their conspicuous use of bioluminescence. Their sister family, the Neoscopelidae, are much fewer in number but superficially very similar; at least one neoscopelid shares the common name 'lanternfish': the large-scaled <b>lantern</b> <b>fish,</b> Neoscopelus macrolepidotus.|$|E
50|$|A {{major source}} of food for many marine animals, {{lanternfish}} are an important link in the food chain of many local ecosystems, being heavily preyed upon by whales and dolphins, large pelagic fish such as salmon, tuna and sharks, grenadiers and other deep-sea fish (including other lanternfish), pinnipeds, sea birds, notably penguins, and large squid such as the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas. Lanternfish themselves {{have been found to}} feed on bits of plastic debris accumulating in the oceans. At least one <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> was found with over 80 pieces of plastic chips in its gut, according to scientists monitoring ocean plastic in the Pacific Ocean's eastern garbage patch.|$|E
50|$|The Melanocetidae {{appear to}} buck {{the trend in}} deepsea anglers, in that the males - despite not feeding as an adult and thus being little more than {{couriers}} of sperm - are free-living rather than parasitic. A brief attachment to the female does probably occur, however, as evidenced by a case of mistaken identity: A male humpback anglerfish was found attached to the lip of a female horned <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> (Centrophryne spinulosa) of an unrelated (though also nonparasitic) family of anglerfish, Centrophrynidae. Little else is known of their reproduction: They are presumed to not be guarders, releasing buoyant eggs into the water which {{become part of the}} zooplankton.|$|E
5000|$|Dusky {{dolphins}} prey on {{a variety}} of fish and squid species. Common fish species eaten include anchovies, <b>lantern</b> <b>fish,</b> pilchards, sculpins, hakes, horse mackerel, hoki and red cod. They are generally coordinated hunters. Their very flexible foraging strategies can change depending on the environment. In certain parts of New Zealand, where deep oceanic waters meet the shore, dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually, but form groups when in the layer. [...] The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey. Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends.|$|E
50|$|It {{can take}} at least 14 days for {{microplastics}} to pass from an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' gills can cause a prolonged presence. When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders. For example, scientists have reported plastic accumulation in the stomachs of <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> which are small filter feeders and are the main prey for commercial fish like tuna and swordfish. Microplastics also absorb chemical pollutants that can be transferred into the organism's tissues.Furthermore, small animals {{are at risk of}} reduced food intake due to false satiation and resulting starvation or other physical harm from the microplastics.|$|E
50|$|Many aquatic/marine organisms have {{developed}} organs {{to compensate for}} their weight and control their buoyancy in the water. These structures, make the density of their bodies very close {{to that of the}} surrounding water. Some hydrozoans, such as siphonophores, has gas-filled floats; the Nautilus, Sepia, and Spirula (Cephalopods) have chambers of gas within their shells; and most teleost fish and many <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> (Myctophidae) are equipped with swim bladders. Many aquatic and marine organisms may also be composed of low-density materials. Deep-water teleosts, which do not have a swim bladder, have few lipids and proteins, deeply ossified bones, and watery tissues that maintain their buoyancy. Some sharks' livers are composed of low-density lipids, such as hydrocarbon squalene or wax esters (also found in Myctophidae without swim bladders), which provide buoyancy.|$|E
50|$|The female horned <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> {{measures}} up to 23 cm {{in length}} and is long and slender, with a large head and jaws of equal length. The jaws are filled with slender, recurved, depressible teeth of mixed large and small sizes. There is a large oval pit {{in front of each}} eye in specimens larger than 42 mm. The eye itself lies beneath the skin and appears through a translucent patch. The fish is reddish brown to black in color; its skin is covered with numerous close-set spines. The illicium ("fishing rod") and esca (lure) are attached to the snout. The esca has a fan-shaped appendage in front and another short appendage on the back; the tip is white with scattered large melanophores. There is a small hyoid barbel, although it is vestigial in adult females.|$|E
50|$|The Bonin petrel and the {{closely related}} mottled petrel {{are the only}} Pterodroma petrels with a fish {{dominated}} diet. Principal prey items are fish from the family Myctophidae (<b>lantern</b> <b>fish)</b> and Sternoptychidae (hatchetfish). Squid from the family Ommastrephidae are also consumed. All of these prey are midwater residents that use photophores and migrate to the surface during the night to feed; thus {{it is assumed that}} Bonin petrels are nocturnal feeders that seize prey at the surface while resting on the sea or in flight. Bonin petrel eyes contain high levels of the pigment rhodopsin which aids nocturnal vision. The Bonin petrel is usually solitary at sea, but is occasionally seen in large multi-species flocks. Like all procellariids the Bonin petrel has a modified area of the gut known as a proventriculus which partly digests prey to create stomach oil, an energy rich oil which is lighter to carry than prey.|$|E
5000|$|They feed {{primarily}} on plankton, including euphausiids, copepods, and {{a form of}} amphipod that is parasitic to jellyfish gonadal pouches. They also feed {{to a large extent}} on myctophids (<b>lantern</b> <b>fish)</b> which only occur at the surface at night in water over the continental slope. Individuals have been observed to feed at distances up to 1000 km from their breeding colony. [...] Breeding individuals store energy rich lipids in a sac anterior to their stomach which are used to either sustain themselves while incubating their single egg, to feed their chick, or can also be used as a defensive mechanism when caught by a predator as do many other Procellariformes. There is evidence showing that parents feed their chicks different prey species than they consume themselves. Parent birds also accidentally feed their chicks plastic debris which they mistake for food items floating {{on the surface of the}} ocean. Chicks grow to a prefledging weight almost double of that when they actually fledge from the burrow in late September. Fall storms can cause these young fledging individuals to wreck on the mainland.|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods for}} {{processing}} and utilization of <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> (Benthosema pterotum) are reported. Nutritional evaluation of fish meal and fish hydrolysate from <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> {{has been carried}} out. Growth rate and PER of <b>lantern</b> <b>fish</b> meal are similar and better {{than that of the}} reference protein, casein. <b>Lantern</b> <b>fish</b> meal can therefore be extensively used for the formulation of poultry, fish and other animal feeds as a good protein supplement with beneficial effects...|$|E
