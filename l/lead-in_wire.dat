DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The electrolysis cell with high power capacity {{for the production of}} ozone-oxygen mixture, comprises two electrode edge plates with <b>lead-in</b> <b>wire</b> and a bipolar electrode plate that are contacted together through a solid electrolyte membrane (5) and compressed together by a chip frame. The electrode base body is made of impregnated graphite. In the electrode base body (1), inlet and discharge lines for electrolysis media (13, 15, 17, 18), flow channel (14, 16) in cathode side for catholyte media and hydraulic or pneumatic pressing mechanism (10, 11, 12) in the anode side are incorporated. The structured anode plates are made of self-passivation metal equipped with an active layer and bind in plastic anode frames, which are equipped with flow channels for transporting the anolyte medium to and/or from the anode plates. The pressing mechanism is formed from pneumatic or hydraulic inflatable thrust bolts that press the anode plate against the solid electrolyte membrane by movably arranged thrust plate. The anode frame and anode plate are separated through isolating, flexible plastic foils from the electrode base plate with the pressing mechanism. The contacting of the anode plate is carried out by contact foils that are connected to the isolated plastic foil or beneath the anode frame with the electrode base plate. The anode plate consists of expanded metals or sheet metals in which slits are incorporated in flow direction. The anode plates are equipped with longitudinal- or transversal shaft in which fine openings are incorporated in the flow direction and shaft upper side adjacent to the electrolyte membrane. The active layer of the anode plate consists of doped diamond, noble metal or noble metal containing oxide. The anode plates are formed out of partial sections flow throughable one after other in flow direction. The solid electrolyte membrane is cation exchange membrane with a perflourinated synthetic resin matrix. A gas diffusion layer is arranged between the cathode channel and the electrolyte membrane, compresses by the pressing mechanism on the path between the cathode channel and on the solid electrolyte membrane and is contacted with the cathode channel and the electrolyte membrane. Plastic inlet and outlet segment are incorporated in the electrode base body and allow supply and discharge of the anolyte medium isolated against the graphite base body. The movably arranged pressing plate consists of rigid plates that are equipped {{in the direction of the}} anode with flexible intermediate layers. The surface of the anode plate is 100 - 1000 cm 2.

50|$|Working in the {{basement}} of his home on Orchard Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Diehl invented a lamp that was different from Thomas Edison's incandescent electric lamp, which was patented in 1879. Diehl's lamp had no <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires.</b> In 1882 Diehl obtained the first patent on this induction incandescent lamp. The base of the lamp contained a wire coil that coupled with a primary coil in the lamp socket, causing current to flow through the lamp without the need for <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires.</b> Two additional patents were granted in 1883, followed by patents for electrical lighting systems in 1885 and 1886.|$|R

40|$|Research {{into high}} {{pressure}} mercury discharge lamps at Philips In this study {{the work of}} C. Bol and the physicist dr. W. Elenbaas in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in the period 1930 - 1940 is described. The paper treats their contributions to high pressure mercury discharge lamps, especially the water cooled super high pressure mercury discharge lamps with a pressure of a few hundreds of atmosphere. Because of their rather white colour and high efficiency, high pressure mercury lamps were, from 1906 on, a potential rival of the incandescent lamps, especially for street and square lighting. However, severe problems with the ignition of the gas discharge and the <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires</b> prevented the introduction of these lamps at that time. In the early thirties Bol contributed to a great extend to {{the solution of the}} problem of the <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires,</b> after which super high pressure mercury discharge lamps were technically feasible. Elenbaas theoretically derived mathematical relations between technically important variables, such as efficiency, candlepower and luminence, which were instrumental in the invention and development of super high pressure mercury lamps. Some remarks are made on the differences between scientifically and technically oriented theories. It is concluded that in an industrial context a special kind of theories is developed which could be denominated 'technological theories'. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} a possibility to apply the vacuum deposition {{in the production of}} switching boards, to develop the production process (PP) of forming the conductor ctructures. The methods permitting to construct PP for vacuum deposition of the switching boards by an erosion plasma generator have been developed. The algorithm for choosing deposition conditions has been proposed. Several PP distinguishing with using different short <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires</b> of the switching board bases and procedures of making topological lay-out have been proposed. The methods for construction of PP for vaccum deposition of the heat non-resistant bases have been introduced at the State Scientific Centre "VEI".

40|$|Two {{thin plates}} of {{high-density}} UO/sub 2 / were sandwiched together with thermocouples {{between them and}} pressed against the outer surfaces. The thermocouples were used as electrodes and the electrical resistivity of the UO/sub 2 / measured by the potential drop method using corresponding arms of the thermocouples as current <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires</b> and potential probes. The UO/sub 2 / was heated by its own fission heat and the electrical resistivity measured at temperatures from 50 to 972 deg C. Preirradiation measurements were made using an electric furnace to obtain temperatures to 750 deg C. Electrical resistivity did not change with irradiation up to about 10 /sup 1 //sup 8 / nvt, {{at which point the}} resistivity decreased by a factor of 3. The resistivity ranged from 8. 75 x 10 /sup 3 / ohm-cm at room temperature (before irradiation) to 0. 4 ohm-cm at 773 deg C (after nvt > 10 /sup 1 //sup 8 /). The activation energy was 0. 5 ev during irradiation as compared with 0. 65 ev before irradiation. The temperature between the plates was higher than the outside temperature during irradiation. This thermal gradient created a thermoelectric emf between the UO/sub 2 / and the platinum thermocouples. The thermoelectric emf for the Pt-UO/sub 2 /-Pt system ranged from 130 mu v/ deg C at 162 deg C to 29 mu v/ deg C at 900 deg C. The UO/sub 2 / behaved lixe an n-type conductor during irradiation.

25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum <b>lead-in</b> <b>wires.</b> This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|R
