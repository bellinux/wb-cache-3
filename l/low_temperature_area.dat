Recently, the infrared thermometers have become smaller, and less expensive. We measured the surface temperature of Keiketsu in {{the periphery of the}} navel by using this infrared thermometer. And, we examined the relation between the temperature distribution and Shou (constitution of Kampo medicine). As a result, we have clarified that the upper abdominal area and lower navel area have low temperatures in women, that the higher navel area has a low temperature in men. And, this trend occurs both in summer and winter. Also, women who have <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>area</b> beneath the navel complain more about their pains during menstruation. The researcher who used thermography, had thought that the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>area</b> of the abdomen in the low abdominal area has some relation to Oketsu. The result of my research was in accord with their opinion. Also, the Ministry of Health and Welfare issues warnings because 2 ̆ 7 Shou 2 ̆ 7 is considered when using Kampo medicine, due the side effect called interstitial pneumonia occurring in patients with Kampo medicine intake. Even from this viewpoint, the infrared thermometer will become more effective than thermography for the purpose...|$|E

40|$|Two {{samples of}} the {{ferromagnetic}} alloy – ferroelectric ceramics nanocomposite (FeCoZr) x(PbZrTiO 3) (100 −x) of similar metallic phase contents have been produced using ion-beam sputtering in the atmosphere of argon and oxygen. The samples have been produced {{in order to examine}} the influence of sputtering atmosphere parameters on electrical properties of the tested materials. In a nanocomposite of a reduced oxygen content, a conductivity increase by about three orders occurs along with the increasing frequency, which is associated with the occurrence of hopping recharging. Over the whole area of low measuring frequencies, negative values of the phase shift and a capacitive type of conductivity occur. For the frequency of about 106 Hz, the phase shift reaches zero, which corresponds to the voltage resonance phenomenon. For higher frequencies, positive phase shift values and inductive conductivity occur. For a sample of a higher oxygen content, phenomena of voltage resonance (low frequency values) and current resonance (high frequency values) can be observed. When the oxygen content increases, frequency dependences of the phase difference get shifted into the low frequency area. This is associated with the surface oxidation or a complete oxidation of the metallic-phase nanograins, which increases the potential barrier as well as with an increase of the relaxation time activation energy. For the sample of a higher oxygen content, an increase of the conductivity activation energy has been observed in the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the Hakone hydrothermal system and geochemistry of thermal waters are described. The subsurface temperature map and the zonal distribution of thermal waters strongly suggest that thermal energy of the Hakone system is essentially supplied by dense volcanic steam rich in sodium chloride coming up through the volcanic conduit, from which subsurface streams of sodium chloride waters are derived. The seismic activity of Hakone mostly takes place at relatively shallow depths in {{the central part of}} the caldera. The chemical and physical properties of the dense steam are examined assuming that the phase transformation of water to steam is the major cause for volcanic earthquakes. The Cl-SO{sub 4 } chemistry permits estimation of sodium chloride content of 0. 5 to 1 % in original dense steam responsible for sodium chloride waters. Thanks to the work of Sourirajan and Kennedy (1962) temperature pressure condition of volcanic dense steam at depths of 1 to 2 km below sea-level is estimated to be about 385 C and 230 bars, dissolving 0. 5 to 1 % of sodium chloride in steam. Below the depth of 4 km, earthquakes seldom occur, the hydrothermal system is saturated with solid sodium chloride, resulting in lowered vapor pressure. This implies that the permeation of meteoric water to the volcanic steam system mostly takes place at a depth less than 4 km. The analogy of hot eyes (centers of geothermal fields) and cold eyelids (surroundings of <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>area)</b> is emphasized for better understanding of hydrothermal systems...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{influential}} feature on room temperature distribution is the insulation quality of the room. Each room of the typical Japanese modern house has a low heat capacity, high insulation quality and large windows which are less insulated. Temperature near the window is naturally low. These factors make the thermal insulation of the room strongly uneven. When heating the room, {{the location of the}} heat source largely affects room temperature distribution as well. This kind of distribution will be emphasized using an air-conditioner. Room air temperature using heating equipment such as this has both a high <b>temperature</b> <b>area</b> due to the air jet discharged from the outlet and several <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>areas</b> due to drafts from the window.
