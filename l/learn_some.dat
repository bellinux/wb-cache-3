5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Cairo in April 1999, Bok {{was directed to}} Sacred Heart Catholic Church. This church was well known among the Dinka in Khartoum {{as a place of}} refuge in Cairo. While staying at Sacred Heart, Bok began to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo. He also began practicing his Christian faith without fear of reprisal. He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States, Great Britain or Australia.|$|E
5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of the}} first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge.

Activities include learning language – written and oral – and numbers, development of personal and social skills, games, music, and outdoor play. Children learn two languages, English and their official Mother Tongue (Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil). Many private or church-based kindergartens might not offer Malay or Tamil, so non-Chinese pupils might also <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> Standard Mandarin in these kindergartens.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} case {{reported}} {{is that of}} patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison's chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy (both of his MTLs were removed). As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened {{more than a few}} minutes earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, he still had the ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|After a {{visit to}} Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he {{received}} private lessons from Liszt, {{one of the few}} pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there {{can be no doubt that}} it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years." ...|$|E
500|$|As Ripken's playing career wound down, his {{coaching}} career began. His first experience as manager came in 1961, when he succeeded Billy DeMars (who had been promoted) as Leesburg's manager in June. Leesburg folded after the 1961 season. In 1963, {{at the age}} of 27, he became a full-time manager with Fox Cities. From 1963 through 1974, he managed Fox Cities, Abderdeen (1963–64,66), the Tri-City Atoms (1965), the Miami Marlins (1967), the Elmira Pioneers (1968), Rochester (1969–70), the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs (1971), and the Asheville Orioles (1972–74). As a manager in the minor leagues, Ripken oversaw the development of Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and Rich Dauer, among other Orioles. In addition to normal coaching duties, he would also at times be responsible for driving the team bus, or even fixing it. During 1969–70, managing a Triple-A team, he would conduct baseball clinics for the Red Wings players. Cal Jr. would always listen to these; he found them [...] "boring" [...] but did <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> useful baseball skills in them. Although Ripken always considered Aberdeen, Maryland, his home during this period, he and his family lived all over the country as he moved from city to city. In 1975, Ripken served as a scout for the Orioles.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay drew {{a variety}} of {{reactions}} from [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "intriguing", to formulaic. The puzzles were generally considered by critics as challenging and well-done. The duration of the game was considered short, and reviewers criticized the spacing of the save points and absence of checkpoints. The game's adherence to the formula of the Silent Hill series also drew criticism; the opening comment of GameSpot's review remarked that [...] "this old fog needs to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> new tricks", and further detailed that the game provided [...] "an entirely conventional adventure that relies on eight-year-old franchise hallmarks {{at the expense of}} anything truly new." [...] Some camera issues were noted, especially in tight corridors. Reviewers wrote that Origins had a greater emphasis on combat than previous installments, although reaction to the combat was generally negative. Some reviewers felt that the player was encouraged to avoid combat, due to {{a variety of}} gameplay factors, including the breakable melee weapons. On the other hand, GameSpy's David Chapman stated that the readily available weapons made Travis too powerful. The inclusion of quick time events was not well received by reviewers, who felt that it added nothing appealing to the game. Additionally, the soundtrack was frequently praised as frightening, and a part of the game's appeal. The PlayStation Official Magazine UK wrote: [...] "Despite its small-screen setting, Origins even manages a few genuine scares, mostly thanks to the first-rate sound: this should only be played through headphones." ...|$|E

500|$|Westley was {{appointed}} manager of League Two bottom side Newport County on 7 October 2016, following the sacking of Warren Feeney. Despite Westley criticising his players with some [...] "harsh words", {{saying he was}} [...] "not prepared to tolerate that sort of rubbish anymore", Newport went on to lose eight successive games, which Westley described as [...] "embarrassing" [...] and [...] "humiliating". Club secretary Graham Bean resigned in December, saying [...] "Graham Westley is an impossible man to work with... he needs to <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> manners and start treating people with some respect". Shortly afterwards Westley again courted controversy after refusing to leave opposition manager Derek Adams's press conference. He signed 14 players in the January transfer window, a move he admitted was a [...] "short-term risk". However he failed to arrest the team's declining fortunes and was sacked on 9 March 2017 with Newport 11 points adrift {{at the bottom of}} League Two. The club's board said that they had consulted both fans and the players over their decision to sack Westley; he had been confronted by irate supporters at Rodney Parade and after his sacking transfer-listed midfielder Mark Randall came out to say he had been [...] "treated quite unfairly" [...] by Westley. Caretaker-manager Michael Flynn managed to organise an unlikely escape from relegation for the [...] "Exiles" [...] after overseeing seven victories in the remaining 12 games of the 2016–17 season.|$|E
500|$|The Element {{system of}} Chrono Cross handles all magic, {{consumable}} items, and character-specific abilities. Elements unleash magic effects upon the enemy or party {{and must be}} equipped for use, much like the materia of 1997's Final FantasyVII. Elements can be purchased from shops or found in treasure chests littered throughout areas. Once acquired, they are allocated to a grid whose size and shape are unique to each character. They are ranked according to eight tiers; certain high level Elements can only be assigned on equivalent tiers in a character's grid. As the game progresses, the grid expands, allowing more Elements to be equipped and higher tiers to be accessed. Elements are divided into six paired oppositional types, or [...] "colors," [...] each with a natural effect. Red (fire/magma) opposes Blue (water/ice), Green (wind/flora) opposes Yellow (earth/lightning), and White (light/cosmos) opposes Black (darkness/gravity). Each character and enemy has an innate color, enhancing the power of using same-color Elements while also making them weak against elements of the opposite color. Chrono Cross also features a [...] "field effect", which keeps track of Element color used in the upper corner of the battle screen. If the field is purely one color, characters are able to unleash a powerful summon element {{at the cost of}} one the player's stars. The field will also enhance the power of Elements of the colors present, while weakening Elements of the opposite colors. Characters also innately <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> special techniques ("Techs") that are unique to each character but otherwise act like Elements. Like Chrono Trigger, characters can combine certain Techs to make more powerful Double or Triple Techs. Consumable Elements may be used to restore hit points or heal status ailments after battle.|$|E
