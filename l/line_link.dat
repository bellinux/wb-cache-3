5|$|Service on the Yellow Line {{began on}} April 30, 1983, adding Archives {{to the system}} and linking the two already-built {{stations}} of Gallery Place and Pentagon with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond National Airport by four stations to Huntington on December 17, 1983, the first station outside of the Capital Beltway. When the Green <b>Line</b> <b>link</b> to U Street opened on May 11, 1991, it acted {{as an extension of}} the Yellow Line until the southern Green Line branch was completed. When Green Line service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at Mount Vernon Square, where a pocket track exists to relay trains.|$|E

The agency is {{considering}} two lines of action: either building the route along the current right-of-way, or moving the section from Riddervolds gate and Inkognitoveien to Skovveien. The latter would involve that the Briskeby <b>Line</b> <b>link</b> up with the Frogner Line in Frognerveien and run concurrently with it to Solli plass.|$|E

25|$|Pierson & Dorman Long {{wanted to}} build a {{steelworks}} at Richborough Port, with new towns to house the workers at Woodnesborough and Ash and using coal from its colliery at Betteshanger. It regarded the EKLR as a nuisance, and never encouraged it. However, the EKLR did ship coal for export from Snowdown from 1929 to the mid thirties, and pit props in the other direction. All plans were abandoned at the Depression. A main <b>line</b> <b>link</b> for coal traffic was actually authorised for Dover Eastern Harbour via a tunnel under the castle in 1933, just about the time when it was finally realized that the Kent coalfield was a commercial failure.|$|E
25|$|A single <b>line</b> <b>link</b> to the South Eastern Railway's Tunbridge Wells {{station was}} opened to {{passengers}} in 1876. The line from Uckfield was double tracked in 1894 and {{the completion of}} the Withyham spur between Ashurst and Birchden Junction enabled London services to run through to Uckfield or down the Cuckoo Line without reversing at Groombridge. However, little use was made until 1914. The spur completed what was called the Outer Circle line, which provided an alternative route between Brighton and London via Oxted. The line was also the only subsidiary cross-country double line in East Sussex and, as it did not figure in Southern Railway's electrification programme in the 1930s, it was the last steam-operated line in the area.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Line</b> <b>link</b> frames (LLFs) are {{tiers of}} 10x20 {{crossbar}} switches {{in two or}} more bays. The switches in the first bay have their horizontal multiples, or [...] "banjo wires", cut in half, effectively dividing each switch into a line switch and a line junctor switch. Each of the ten junctor switches have ten junctors on its ten verticals, and each of its ten levels was wired as a <b>line</b> <b>link,</b> {{to one of the}} ten line switches of the LLF. Thus, the <b>line</b> <b>link</b> frame terminates 100 Junctors. Each junctor has full availability to however many hundreds of lines there are, via the hundred line links. The number of lines, thus the line concentration ratio (LCR), was engineered for the expected occupancy.|$|E

The Bellin and the Meiktila Sub-Power Stations will be linked to each other with 100 km long 23 kV double power lines. US$45.8 million worth of 230 KVA cables and equipment were used for construction and linking of these sub- power stations.|$|E
