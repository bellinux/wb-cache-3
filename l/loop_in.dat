5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E

5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|The M-43 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to at least July 1, 1919, when it was used {{on a series of}} roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one of these changes {{led to the creation of}} a business <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 along {{a portion of}} the current roadway. In a series of extensions, M-55 was lengthened to connect its current endpoints by the early 1930s.

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single <b>loop.</b> <b>In</b> the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E

Single <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> an irreducible representation are multiplicatively renormalized without mixing, through a renormalization constant which depends upon both representation and temperature. The values of renormalized <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> the four lowest representations of SU(3) were measured numerically on small, coarse lattices. We {{find that in}} magnitude, condensates for the sextet and octet loops are approximately {{the square of the}} triplet loop. This agrees with a large N expansion, where factorization implies that the expectation values of <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> adjoint and higher representations are just powers of fundamental and anti-fundamental loops.

5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, a bypass of {{downtown}} South Haven was built; the former route of US31 {{through the heart}} of the city was designated Bus. US31 at that time. After the war, the route of US31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to run on a more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to the south and east of Holland opened and the former route through down was redesignated as a business <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> 1954.|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that DNA hairpin-loops usually contain four unpaired bases. However, a small subset of sequences can form two-base loops. We have previously described an in vivo assay that is sensitive to tight loop formation and have set out to test whether DNA sequences known to form two-base <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> vitro also form tight <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> vivo. It is shown that the sequences 5 'dCNNG and 5 'dTNNA behave as predicted if they favour two-base <b>loop</b> formation <b>in</b> vivo, a result {{that is consistent with}} previously described in vitro studies. The ability of specific DNA sequences to form tight <b>loops</b> <b>in</b> vivo has implications for their potential to form transient structures involved in gene regulation, recombination and mutagenesis...|$|R
5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1960s. By the end of 1963, the southern section of freeway was extended to Schoolcraft. The following year, a business <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> Kalamazoo was created. The new loop used a freeway stub on the north and M-43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown. A discontinuous segment of freeway, south of Cadillac into Osceola County, opened in September 1966. The freeway was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the Comstock Park area in 1966. That year, the former Grand Rapids Speedrome, a local race car track was closed. Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive, the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the freeway construction in 1966. The freeway was extended further to M-57 (14Mile Road) near Cedar Springs in 1969.|$|E
5|$|However, {{no further}} tram lines were closed. In 1969, {{the site of}} the turning loop at Sinsen needed to be moved to allow the {{construction}} of the Sinsen Interchange. Instead of closing the line, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a new loop at Muselunden at Sinsen. The Ekeberg Line was scheduled to close in 1972, because a new line needed to be built to allow passage during the construction of Oslo Central Station, which would replace the Østbanen. After heavy protests from Ekeberg residents, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> Vognmannsgata in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|I-495 forms a wide loop {{around the}} outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate {{highways}} in Massachusetts include U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a general prohibition on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> the Boston area. A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, US27 was shifted {{to run through}} St. Louis instead of Alma, and the former route was renumbered US27A. US127 was realigned near Mason in the mid-1940s, and a {{business}} loop was created out of the former routing there. A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business <b>loop.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1960s, a new expressway (later freeway) for US27 through Central Michigan {{led to the creation}} of several business loops. Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business loops. The 2002 extension of US127 to replace US27 also led to the redesignation of business loops to their current monikers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the cloud}} pattern {{associated}} with the system featured a tight and well-defined circulation, as well as clusters of deep convection south of the center. Due to the proximity of a large upper-level low-pressure area in the southern Gulf of Mexico, the surrounding environment did not favor intensification. Influenced by the low, the depression moved southward. The system completed a cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>in</b> the central gulf, and by early on September 18 was drifting northward. As a result of wind shear, the center of circulation was separated from the deep convective activity. Early the next day, deep convection persisted in a small area northeast of the center. Forward motion was nearly stationary, with a gradual drift east-southeastward. Despite the wind shear, the depression attained tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on September19; as such, it was named Hermine by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
