5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E

25|$|Language {{development}} {{is thought to}} proceed by ordinary processes of learning in which children acquire the forms, meanings, and uses of words and utterances from the linguistic input. The method in which we develop language skills is universal; however, the major debate is how the rules of syntax are acquired. There are two major approaches to syntactic development, an empiricist account by which children <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> syntactic rules from the linguistic input, and a nativist approach by which some principles of syntax are innate and are transmitted through the human genome.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{his later}} years, Scheinberg {{continued}} to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He always took the Talmudic tractate of Niddah with him and tried to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking or driving to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, even at a wedding, and propped a Mishnah Berurah on the shelf above his kitchen sink while he washed dishes.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Tilda Swinton, {{who was the first}} choice to play Jadis, the White Witch, casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002, Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late. Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in a 1998 dramatization of Cider with Rosie. He quit school to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> his lines and beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter.|$|E

25|$|Springfield {{has been}} {{converted}} into a skate park for the Annual Skate Tour, full with skate-able objects and landmarks from the television series. Players are able to choose one of the nine characters available to compete for the grand prize. All of the characters' voices were recorded by the actual voice actors from The Simpsons. Each character has over forty unique moves. Players can test their skills in either a two-player head-to-head skate off, or in one of the fast and furious modes: Freeskate, Skate Fest, Trick Contest, and a game of skateboard H-O-R-S-E, unlocking additional characters, locations, and skateboards. Players can also choose to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> the skateboard moves and tricks before they begin the actual game in the Skillz School mode.|$|E
25|$|De Keyser's {{career was}} not limited to Amsterdam, and his {{international}} contacts helped him {{to keep in touch with}} the mainstream of European architecture. The Amsterdam city administrators sent him to England where he worked with Inigo Jones (1573-1652). Jones was the first English architect who went to Italy to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> he could about classical architecture. He studied the famous treatises written by the Roman architect Vitruvius (circa 30 BC), and his intimate knowledge of the work of Palladio (1518-1580) gave him the nickname the English Palladio. The Banqueting House in London, designed for the Stuart monarchs, became the prototype of classical architecture in England. When De Keyser returned to Amsterdam one of Jones’ assistants, Nicholas Stone, joined him. Stone worked with De Keyser in Amsterdam from 1607 to 1613 and even became his son-in-law. De Keyser attention to England and English architecture reflect Amsterdam's position as a commercial centre in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{recommendation}} of his parents, O'Halloran moved to Sydney in late 1955 to train with Frank Guthrie {{in an attempt to}} qualify for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. He boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses. But his initiation into Guthrie's training program was difficult.

500|$|In 1988 Pinker and Alan Prince {{published}} an influential critique of a connectionist {{model of the}} acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed {{by a series of}} studies of how people use and acquire the past tense.

He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to <b>learn</b> <b>all</b> forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by generative phonology. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as [...] "-ed": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular [...] "-ed" [...] ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as ...|$|E
