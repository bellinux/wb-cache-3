25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, {{who knew how to}} squeeze the <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition with just the right run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E

Scarcely had he done so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|E

The New York Times spoke further on elements of his speaking style in its 2009 obituary: [...] "his style was stop-and-go, with superb pacing and silences that rivaled Jack Benny’s. He spoke {{directly to the}} listener, with punchy sentences, occasional exclamations of “Good heavens!” or “Oh, my goodness!” and pauses that squeezed out the <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of suspense: the radio broadcaster’s equivalent of the raised eyebrow or the knowing grin." [...] Bob Greene described the opening phrase of the speech as [...] "seemingly simple, and devastatingly direct".|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) {{were said to}} be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, {{speaking}} in the House of Commons, Princess Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, [...] "I would shed the <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of my blood for my niece." [...] The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that the Duke intended to murder Princess Victoria and take the British Throne for himself.|$|E

Bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz asserted that [...] "We're definitely writing all the time, so we're {{not going to}} try to squeeze every <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> out of the stone. That's part of what's been wrong with the rock industry: they keep fans waiting far too long, and bands go away and disappear off the face of the planet. That's not the way it's going to be for Fall Out Boy." [...] During this time off, Fall Out Boy contributed a cover of the song [...] "What's This?" [...] for the 2006 rerelease of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack, as well as a remix of their song [...] "Of All the Gin Joints in All the World" [...] for the Snakes on a Plane soundtrack. Wentz also purchased a house in Los Angeles, where he spent much time writing lyrics to new songs.|$|E
500|$|Together, Sudirman and Oerip {{were able}} to reduce the {{differences}} and mistrust between former KNIL and PETA troops, although some troops were reluctant to be subordinated to a central command, instead choosing to follow their popularly selected battalion commanders. The government renamed the Army twice in January 1946, first to the Peoples' Salvation Army (...) , then to the Army of the Republic of Indonesia ( [...] , or TRI). This {{was followed by the}} formal establishment of a navy and air force in early 1946. In the meantime, the Indonesian government had moved from Jakarta– now under Dutch control– to Yogyakarta in January; delegates led by Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir spent much of April and May unsuccessfully negotiating for Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. On 25May Sudirman was reconfirmed as commander-in-chief of the expanded military, after its reorganisation. At the ceremony, Sudirman swore to protect the republic [...] "until he shed his <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of blood." ...|$|E

According to then-Public Works Minister Anwar al-Khatib's recollections, Abu Nuwar argued that his troops would quickly lose control of the Hebron and Nablus regions to Israel, but would [...] "defend Jerusalem to the last man and the <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of blood". Hussein's eagerness to aid Egypt was tempered by Abu Nuwar's assessment, but he only relented in his attempted intervention after Nasser communicated to Hussein appreciation of his genuine support and a warning not to risk losing the Jordanian army to the far stronger Israeli military. Later in his life, Abu Nuwar had stated {{that he had been}} ready [...] "to give the Israelis a very rough time" [...] in 1956, but only dissuaded Hussein when Nasser counseled the king against intervention, after which Abu Nuwar told Hussein that attacking Israel while the Egyptians had withdrawn from Sinai [...] "would be suicide".|$|E

500|$|Fox, who {{graduated}} from RADA on 1 July 2001, followed up The Hole by appearing in Robert Altman's 2001 Academy Award-winning film Gosford Park. He then donned uniforms in a slew of film and television features, including roles as a German airman in Island at War (2004), an SS officer in The <b>Last</b> <b>Drop</b> (2005), and as British soldiers in the 2002 films Deathwatch and Ultimate Force, and in Colditz (2005). In the last made-for-television film, Fox played Capt. Tom Willis who, after an unsuccessful attempt {{to break out of}} a prisoner-of-war camp, is brought to Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle, one of the most infamous German POW camps for officers in World War II. Actor Kevin Whately caught Fox's performance in the last ten minutes of the film, which he characterised as [...] "this young English boy going bonkers and wandering out to be shot", and thought [...] "He's interesting." [...] The next day, at a lunch meeting with [...] "all the powers that be" [...] regarding a new project, Whately mentioned that Fox [...] "would be worth taking a look at".|$|E
500|$|Roderick Farey, in his biographical {{articles}} on Pistrucci, {{described him as}} [...] "an Italian with a fiery disposition, he had numerous arguments with the authorities but no-one could doubt his genius firstly as a cameo cutter and later as an engraver and medallist." [...] Those disputes, and a perceived slowness to complete his works (especially the Waterloo Medal) have been sources of the criticism by later writers. Howard Linecar, in his book on British coin designs and designers, wrote, [...] "there {{is little doubt that}} Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies as a bargaining counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint... On balance it is perhaps fair to say that Pistrucci, having probably been promised that which he could not have... squeezed the <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of blood out of the situation." [...] According to Clancy, [...] "With great talent can often come controversy and throughout his career Pistrucci was acclaimed and reviled in equal measure, maintaining a series of tense relationships with his colleagues, the most pointed of which [...] with his fellow engraver William Wyon." [...] Craig concluded, [...] "Apart from the George and Dragon design, which was less esteemed then than now... this artist's Mint works, unlike his private commissions, were failures".|$|E
500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every <b>last</b> <b>drop</b> of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing. But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world".|$|E

500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every <b>last</b> <b>drop.</b> Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, and yet you do not understand?" ...|$|E
