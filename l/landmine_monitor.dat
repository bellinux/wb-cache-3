40|$|A {{continuously}} operating, scanning x-ray {{machine is}} being developed for landmine detection using backscattered x-rays. The source operates at 130 kV and 650 mA. The x-rays are formed by electrons striking a high Z target. Target shape is an approximate 5 cm wide by 210 cm long racetrack. The electron beam is scanned across this target with electromagnets. There are 105, 1 -cm by 1 -cm collimators in each leg of the racetrack {{for a total of}} 210 collimators. The source is moved in the forward direction(the direction perpendicular to the 210 -cm dimension) at 3 mi/h. The forward velocity and collimator spacing are such that a grid of collimated x-rays are projected at normal incidence to the soil. The spacing between the collimators and the ground results in a 2 -cm by 2 -cm x-ray pixel on the ground. A unique detector arrangement of collimated and uncollimated detectors allows surface features to be recognized and removed, leaving an image of a buried <b>landmine.</b> Another detector <b>monitors</b> the uncollimated x-ray output and is used to normalize the source output. The mine detector is being prepared for an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The ATD is scheduled for midyear of 1998. The results of the source performance in pre ATD tests will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Many {{remote sensing}} data {{processing}} problems are inherently constituted by several tasks {{that can be}} solved either individually or jointly. For instance, each image in a multitemporal classification setting could be taken as an individual task. Here, relation to previous acquisitions should be properly considered because of the non-stationary behavior of temporal, spatial, and angular image features which gives rise to distribution changes. This phenomenon is known as covariate shift. Additionally, when labeled data are scarce or expensive to obtain, the small sample-set problem arises, which makes solving the problems independently in each domain difficult. Multitask learning aims at jointly solving a set of prediction problems by sharing information across tasks. This paper introduces multitask learning in remote sensing data classification. The proposed methods alleviate the dataset shift by imposing cross-information in the classifiers through matrix regularization. We consider the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learner and two different regularization schemes: 1) the inclusion of relational operators between tasks; and 2) the pairwise Euclidean distance of the predictors in the Hilbert space. These methods rely on simple and intuitive modifications of the kernel used in the standard SVM. Experiments are conducted in three challenging remote sensing problems: cloud screening from multispectral images, landmine detection using radar data, and multitemporal and multisource image classification. The pairwise method consistently outperforms standard independent and aggregate approaches by about + 2 % to 4 % in all problems at no additional cost. Also, the solutions found give us information about the distribution shift among tasks.

50|$|The <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor</b> reports “When {{compared}} to other countries, Myanmar has produced the third highest number of known casualties due to antipersonnel landmines, globally, {{over the past six}} years”. Landmines are concentrated in the states around Burma’s borders with Bangladesh and Thailand after decades of war between government and ethnic minority armed groups. With the recent opening up of this isolated country, HALO established an office in Burma and is working closely with government authorities in preparation for a survey and mineclearance program. This is particularly pertinent in the light of refugee return initiatives where landmine removal will be crucial to safe resettlement.|$|E
50|$|HALO resumed mine {{clearance}} in Karabakh in 2000 {{with a view}} to reinforcing capacity through a project of re-equipment, providing additional training and by establishing a mine action centre (MAC). The MAC collates information concerning mines, UXO and safe routes, and disseminates it to all who require it, in particular other NGOs and international humanitarian bodies operating in Karabakh. https://web.archive.org/web/20100420100449/http://www.halotrust.org/nagornokarabakh.html Mine clearance in Karabakh by the HALO Trust continues to the present day. According to the <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor,</b> in 2004 the HALO Trust cleared 3.6 square kilometers of affected land through manual and mechanical demining, and a further 450,000 square meters in 2005 through April. It concentrated clearance on farmland, and re-focused mine risk education on adults, in view of mine casualties rising as agricultural production increased. By the end of 2004, ICRC had provided safe play areas for children in 27 villages.|$|E
50|$|According to the <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor</b> Report (2009), in 2008, MRE was {{provided}} in 57 states and areas, compared to 61 states and areas in 2007. However, in the 1999 MRE programs {{were identified in}} just 14 states. MRE activities increased significantly in Yemen and Somaliland, and also increased to some degree in 10 other states. In Palestine, RE decreased in 2008 but rose sharply in response to conflict in Gaza in December 2008-January 2009. Some of the main players in MRE include Catholic Relief Services, German Caritas international, the Mines Advisory Group, Handicap International, Save the Children, INTERSOS, DanChurchAid, Norwegian People's Aid, the Mines Awareness Trust, Association for Aid and Relief, Japan and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Within the UN system UNICEF is the lead agency for MRE and supports programmes in 30 countries.|$|E
50|$|According to <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor</b> in 2003, 21 new {{mine and}} UXO {{casualties}} {{were recorded in}} Nagorno-Karabakh, including nine people killed and twelve people injured.17 Casualties increased significantly {{in the first six}} months of 2004, with 30 new mine/UXO casualties recorded; eleven people were killed and nineteen injured, including three children. New landmine and UXO casualties had been decreasing since the ceasefire in 1994. In 1995, there were 86 casualties, 64 in 1996, 25 in 1997, 16 in 1998, and 30 in 1999.19 There were fourteen casualties (five killed and nine injured) in 2000, nineteen casualties (four killed and fifteen injured) in 2001, and seventeen casualties (all injured) in 2002. According to HALO, the increasing casualty numbers are the result of record harvests produced in recent years and a greater investment in agriculture. As farmers try to increase their agricultural boundaries, more suspected mined areas are being ploughed—despite advice from HALO and the government, and the presence of danger mine signs. Most incidents involve antivehicle mines. The number of annual incidents per capita in Nagorno-Karabakh is far higher than other heavily mine-affected countries such as Cambodia or Afghanistan. The thirty new casualties in 2004 represent 2.5 people for every 10,000 inhabitants.In 2004, 34 new mine/UXO casualties, including ten people killed and 24 injured, were reported in 25 incidents; another nine people were involved in the incidents but did not suffer physical injuries.25 At least three of the casualties were children. This represents a further significant increase from the 21 new mine/UXO casualties recorded in 2003. Of the 25 incidents in 2004, fourteen were caused by antivehicle mines, seven by antipersonnel mines and four by UXO. In 2004, one deminer was injured during mine clearance operations. http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/nagorno-karabakh.html#fn9466In 2005, one person was killed and three people were injured in five mine/UXO incidents to June; one other person did not suffer physical injuries.|$|E

Consequences from landmines and UXO incidents result in deaths, injuries, subsequent disabilities, and other socioeconomic burdens from the investments in healthcare resources (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). In 2005, {{the total number}} of landmine and UXO casualties in the world was 7, 328, in which 24 percent were killed. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, 38, 849 {{people have been killed in}} Vietnam alone, and 65, 852 have been injured.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are {{in excess of}} 500, 000 Manned Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) in worldwide inventories including several thousand outside of government control. MANPADS are surface-to-air missile systems enabling the operator to launch missiles at aircraft from the ground. The most common MANPADS are the Russian SA- 7 and U. S. Stinger, which feature infrared guidance systems. The concern that MANPADS can easily be acquired by non-state actors' intent on downing civilian and military aircraft has led international agencies, the U. S., and Russia to implement measures {{to reduce the risk}} of a MANPADS attack. International agencies such as the Wassenaar Arrangement work to stop illegal MANPADS proliferation. The U. S. MANPADS Defense Act and the U. S. Department of Homeland Security have implemented measures to counter the MANPADS threat. Russia has revised its export controls and forged a counter-proliferation agreement with most CIS countries. However, the multilateral initiatives to better control MANPADS stocks and transfers are far from comprehensive. A new approach to mitigating the MANPADS threat adopts elements from the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and the <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor.</b> The conclusion of this thesis is that if MANPADS counter-proliferation efforts remain status quo an attack on a commercial aircraft in the western world is imminent...|$|E
40|$|The safe, reliable, and {{efficient}} detection and subsequent removal of buried landmines or other unexploded ordnance (UXO) still remains a challenge. According to <b>Landmine</b> <b>Monitor</b> (2015), almost 60 states suffer {{the threat of}} antipersonnel mine contamination, while the total extent of contaminated areas {{is likely to be}} thousands of square kilometers and the total number of threat objects may be well over 100 million. In contrast, total annual clearing rates are in the order of about 230, 000 landmines and about 200 km 2 for the year of 2014, as the number of new contaminations continues to grow. Although non-technical surveillance for the identification of contamination improves slowly, more progress is needed in the basic detection of UXO. Although many new technologies have been investigated the last 20 years, the classical ones like metal detectors and dogs in cooperation with humans operators are still the most commonly ones used today. Hence, the detection process for many scenarios is unacceptably slow and dangerous for the operators, as they are typically less than 1 m away from the threats. Hence, a sensor technology enabling a sufficient stand-off distance for operators and reliable detection at high area throughput is desirable. The following paper describes the physical background, the system design, and representative measurement results of our innovative radar approach to this problem...|$|E
