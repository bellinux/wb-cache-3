5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{and the introduction of}} the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E

In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
