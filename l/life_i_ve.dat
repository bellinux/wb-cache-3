Many of these firms discovered how attracting tangible ideas and transforming them into innovation is a complex process. This raises questions of how to best handle these complexities of crowdsourcing? By qualitatively examining crowdsourcing in Statoil and interviewing key personnel, <b>I</b> <b>ve</b> noticed how current crowdsourcing theory is largely based on simple problem-solving tasks, and does not directly convert to technological complex innovations. Technical complex crowdsourcing endeavours should use an customised set of principles and conditions. <b>I</b> <b>ve</b> identified eight key conditions to encounter the complex environment of innovations. Examples of these include: Specify the need, to determine and describe what crowd contribution should entail, Interact with the crowd to proactively interact with the crowd to attract tangible ideas, and Idea management to absorb ideas and transforming them into innovations. These conditions support assembling the right kind of crowd, extracting their input and transforming those inputs into tangible innovations. I argue if Statoil or firms alike uphold to these conditions they will manage the complexities of innovation and obtain innovative results from crowdsourcing activities.

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) melastin 8 {{ion channel}} (TRPM 8) is implicated in bladder sensing but limited information on TRPM 8 antagonists in bladder overactivity (BO) is available. This study characterizes a new TRPM 8 -selective antagonist (DFL 23448) and evaluates it in cold-induced behavioral tests and on bladder function and experimental BO in vivo in rats. DFL 23448 displayed IC 50 values of 10 and 21 nM in hTRPM 8 HEK- 293 cells activated by Cooling Agent 10 or cold, but had limited activity (IC 50 > 10 μM) at TRPV 1, TRPA 1, TRPV 4, or at various G-protein-coupled receptors. In rats, DFL 23448 had a half-life of 37 minutes (intravenous; i. v.) or 4. 9 hours (oral). DLF 23448 (10 mg/kg, i. v) reduced icilin-induced wet-dog shakes in rats. Intravesical (<b>i.</b> <b>ves.)</b> DFL 23448 (10 mg/L) but not vehicle increased micturition intervals (MI), micturition volumes (MV) and bladder capacity (BC). During BO by <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2, vehicle controls exhibited reductions of MI, MV and BC by 37 - 39 %, whereas the same parameters only decreased by 12 - 15 % (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01 vs. vehicle) in DFL 23448 -treated rats. In vehicle-treated rats {{but not in}} DFL 23448 -treated rats, <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2 increased bladder pressures. Intravenous DFL 23448 at 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg DFL 23448 or vehicle, increased MI, MV, and BC. During BO by <b>i.</b> <b>ves.</b> PGE 2, MI, MV, and BC decreased in vehicle- and in DFL 23448 1 mg/kg-treated rats, but not in DFL 23448 10 mg/kg-treated rats. Bladder pressures increased less in rats treated with DFL 23448 10 mg/kg than in vehicle- or DFL 23448 1 mg/kg- treated rats. DFL 23448 (10 mg/kg, i. v.), but not vehicle, prevented cold-stress BO.

40|$|One {{diagnostic}} {{criterion of}} alcohol dependence is {{the appearance of}} a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol consumption ceases. Researchers have used various animal models, including isolated brain cells, slices of brain tissue, and intact animals, to study the mechanisms and manifestations of withdrawal. Results from these experimental studies have demonstrated that many consequences of withdrawal found in animals resemble those observed in humans. Such signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include enhanced activity of the autonomic nervous system; body posture and motor abnormalities; hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, including sensory hyperreactivity; convulsions; anxiety; and psychological discomfort. Researchers also have used animal models to study the electrophysiological correlates of withdrawal, as well as neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol dependence and withdrawal.
