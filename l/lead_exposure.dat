5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level <b>lead</b> <b>exposure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent {{study conducted by the}} CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause <b>lead</b> <b>exposure.</b> The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for <b>lead</b> <b>exposure,</b> and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} whether {{differences in}} environmental <b>lead</b> <b>exposures</b> explain the racial disparity in children's blood lead levels. METHODS: Environmental {{sources of lead}} were identified for {{a random sample of}} 172 urban children. RESULTS: Blood lead levels were significantly higher among Black children. Lead-contamination of dust was higher in Black children's homes, and the condition of floors and interior paint was generally poorer. White children were more likely to put soil in their mouths and to suck their fingers, whereas Black children were more likely to put their mouths on window sills and to use a bottle. Major contributors to blood lead were interior <b>lead</b> <b>exposures</b> for Black children and exterior <b>lead</b> <b>exposures</b> for White children. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in housing conditions and exposures to lead-contaminated house dust contribute strongly to the racial disparity in urban children's blood lead levels...|$|R

5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with <b>lead</b> <b>exposure.</b> Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to <b>lead</b> <b>exposure,</b> as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>exposure</b> in {{children}} is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels {{in children}} are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. <b>Lead</b> <b>exposure</b> in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Human <b>exposure</b> to <b>lead</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} health threats today. Lead causes a variety of adverse health effects and is particularly harmful to children. Unfortunately, the current regulation of <b>lead</b> <b>exposures</b> is fragmented and often unsuccessful. California 2 ̆ 7 s Proposition 65, a right-to-know initiative, however, has achieved some noteworthy successes in reducing public <b>exposures</b> to <b>lead.</b> Proposition 65 has spurred faster and more significant lead reductions than federal law by prompting companies to reformulate products and change their manufacturing processes. This Article first discusses the hazards and uses of lead. The author next describes several instances that demonstrate how Proposition 65 has stimulated the development of new technologies and pollution prevention measures to reduce <b>lead</b> <b>exposures.</b> The author then examines why Proposition 65 has been more effective than comparable federal regulations. To conclude, the author notes that a simple, multimedia, self-executing statute like Proposition 65 can be more powerful than a host of complex regulatory programs in achieving actual reductions of pollutants in our environment...|$|R
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of <b>lead</b> <b>exposure.</b> Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current <b>lead</b> <b>exposure,</b> not of total body burden.

However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for <b>lead</b> <b>exposure.</b> Other occupations that present <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes.

Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that <b>lead</b> <b>exposure</b> is a risk factor for asthma in children. <b>Lead</b> <b>exposure</b> has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
