25|$|Greek {{literature}} was divided in well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both dialect and metrics. The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry {{there were three}} super-genres: epic, <b>lyric</b> <b>and</b> drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology. <b>Lyric</b> <b>and</b> drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four (elegiac, iambic, monodic <b>lyric</b> <b>and</b> choral lyric); drama in three (tragedy, comedy and pastoral drama). In prose literature, there was more freedom; the main areas were historiography, philosophy, and political rhetoric.|$|R
