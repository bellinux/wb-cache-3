Soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were excised from five female rats. Capillaries and muscle fibres were demonstrated on thick tissue sections by a triple immunofluorescent method. Stacks of perfectly registered optical images were captured by a confocal microscope and further analysed. Applying stereological methods (POINTGRID, FAKIR and SLICER plugin- modules of the Ellipse programme), we estimated the mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries,</b> adjacent to individual muscle fibre, per unit fibre length (Lcap/Lfib), per unit surface area of the fibre (Lcap/Sfib) and per unit fibre volume (Lcap/Vfib) in the slow SOL and in predominantly fast EDL muscle, and separately in oxidative and glycolytic fibres of EDL muscle. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> per unit fibre length was larger in SOL than in EDL muscle, however, capillary length per unit fibre volume was larger in EDL muscle. There was no difference in the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> per unit fibre surface area between the two muscles. Oxidative and glycolytic fibres differ in the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> per unit fibre surface area (Lcap/Sfib). This parameter probably reflects the oxidative capacity of muscle fibres. In conclusion, capillary supply is evidently well adapted to different muscle fibre types; consequently, an average capillary supply of a heterogeneous muscle depends on the muscle composition.

40|$|Biphasic glomerular {{hypertrophy}} in rats administered puromycin aminonucleoside. Recent {{evidence suggests}} that glomerular hypertrophy is a key event {{in the development of}} focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and hyalinosis (FSGS) in humans and in many experimental models of FSGS. The initial aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if glomerular hypertrophy occurs in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model of FSGS, previously considered not to involve glomerular hypertrophy. Upon identifying significant glomerular hypertrophy, our second aim was to determine the contribution of glomerular capillary growth to this hypertrophy. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 200 g) were administered either PAN (2 mg/ 100 g body wt) subcutaneously, or an equivalent volume of 0. 9 % saline at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Tissue was analyzed at weeks 7 and 13. Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate a range of glomerular parameters. Mean glomerular tuft volume in PAN-treated rats was 48 % greater than in saline-treated rats at seven weeks, and 63 % greater at 13 weeks. Similar results were found for mean renal corpuscle volume. FSGS was absent at seven weeks and minor at 13 weeks. Two-way analysis of variance indicated: significant effects (P < 0. 05 at least) of PAN on capillary length per glomerulus, capillary surface area per glomerulus, capillary diameter and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> per unit volume of glomerulus; and significant effects of time on capillary diameter, capillary length per unit volume of glomerulus and capillary surface area per unit volume of glomerulus. The mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> per glomerulus was 45 % greater in PAN-treated rats at week 7 and 22 % greater in PAN-treated rats at week 13. Taken together, these results indicate a biphasic pattern of glomerular hypertrophy in this model. In the first phase (to 7 weeks), an increase in capillary length contributes to glomerular hypertrophy. In the second phase (7 to 13 weeks), the continued glomerular enlargement appears more likely to be due to an increase in capillary diameter and/or mesangial matrix expansion...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Placental {{insufficiency}} is {{the leading}} cause of intrauterine growth restriction in the developed world and results in chronic hypoxemia in the fetus. Oxygen is essential for fetal heart development, but a hypoxemic environment in utero can permanently alter development of cardiomyocytes. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of placental restriction and chronic hypoxemia on total number of cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, total length of coronary capillaries, and expression of genes regulated by hypoxia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We induced experimental placental restriction from conception, which resulted in fetal growth restriction and chronic hypoxemia. Fetal hearts in the placental restriction group had fewer cardiomyocytes, but interestingly, there was no difference in the percentage of apoptotic cardiomyocytes; the abundance of the transcription factor that mediates hypoxia-induced apoptosis, p 53; or expression of apoptotic genes Bax and Bcl 2. Likewise, there was no difference in the abundance of autophagy regulator beclin 1 or expression of autophagic genes BECN 1, BNIP 3, LAMP 1, and MAP 1 LC 3 B. Furthermore, fetuses exposed to normoxemia (control) or chronic hypoxemia (placental restriction) had similar mRNA expression of a suite of hypoxia-inducible factor target genes, which are essential for angiogenesis (VEGF, Flt 1, Ang 1, Ang 2, and Tie 2), vasodilation (iNOS and Adm), and glycolysis (GLUT 1 and GLUT 3). In addition, there was no change in the expression of PKC-ε, a cardioprotective gene with transcription regulated by hypoxia in a manner independent of hypoxia-inducible factors. There was an increased capillary length density but no difference in the total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> in the hearts of the chronically hypoxemic fetuses. CONCLUSION: The lack of upregulation of hypoxia target genes in response to chronic hypoxemia in the fetal heart in late gestation may be due to a decrease in the number of cardiomyocytes (decreased oxygen demand) and the maintenance of the total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries.</b> Consequently, these adaptive responses in the fetal heart may maintain a normal oxygen tension within the cardiomyocyte of the chronically hypoxemic fetus in late gestation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether capillarity in the denervated and reinnervated rat extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) is scaled by muscle fiber oxidative potential. We visualized capillaries adjacent to a metabolically defined fiber type and estimated capillarity of fibers with very high oxidative potential (O) vs fibers with very low oxidative potential (G). Capillaries and muscle fiber types were shown by a combined triple immunofluorescent technique and the histochemical method for NADH-tetrazolium reductase. Stacks of images were captured by a confocal microscope. Applying the Ellipse program, fibers were outlined, and the diameter, perimeter, cross-sectional area, length, surface area, and volume within the stack were calculated for both fiber types. Using the Tracer plug-in module, capillaries were traced within the three-dimensional (3 D) volume, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> adjacent to individual muscle fibers was measured, and the capillary length per fiber length (Lcap/Lfib), surface area (Lcap/Sfib), and volume (Lcap/Vfib) were calculated. Furthermore, capillaries and fibers of both types were visualized in 3 D. In all experimental groups, O and G fibers significantly differed in girth, Lcap/Sfib, and Lcap/Vfib, but not in Lcap/Lfib. We conclude that capillarity in the EDL is scaled by muscle fiber size and not by muscle fiber oxidative potential. (J Histochem Cytochem 57 : 437 – 447, 2009...|$|E

Total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> in the hypertrophic hearts increased significantly, but less than the increase in cardiac weight, resulting in reduced capillary length density.

In the normotensive rats, chronic swimming resulted only in a moderate increase in total capillary length associated with a small increase in the left ventricular weight of similar degree.

The ratio between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>capillaries</b> in contact with fibres and fibre perimeter (LC/PF) has also been used as an index for capillary tortuosity. The possibility of change in capillary tortuosity with endurance training was not considered in previous studies. Consequently, this study investigated the effect of 14 weeks of endurance training on muscle microvascularization, including microvessel tortuosity, in 11 elderly men (8 th decade). Microvessels were analysed using the CD 31 antibody. Together with the significant increase in peak oxygen exchange and citrate synthase activity, there was a significant increase in C/F. While CFPE and CAFA remained unchanged, an important finding was the clear increase in LC/PF (56 %; P < 0. 001) for a same sarcomere length. We also found a strong correlation between oxidative enzyme activity and LC/PF both before and after training. These results indicate that endurance training induces significant remodelling in the microvessel network in elderly men and that an increase in the degree of microvessel tortuosity would be an important mechanism of adaptation to endurance training...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>capillary</b> filling using two lattice Boltzmann schemes: a liquid-gas model and a binary model. The simulation results are {{compared to the}} well-known Washburn's law, which predicts that the filled <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capillary</b> scales with time as l ∝ t 1 / 2. We find that the liquid-gas model does not reproduce Washburn's law due to condensation of the gas phase at the interface, which causes the asymptotic behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>capillary</b> penetration to be faster than t 1 / 2. The binary model, on the other hand, captures the correct scaling behaviour when the viscosity ratio between the two phases is sufficiently high. © EDP Sciences, Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|R
