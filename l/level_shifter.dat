40|$|Abstract—The use of {{multiple}} voltages for different cores is becoming a widely accepted technique for efficient power management. <b>Level</b> <b>shifters</b> are used as interfaces between voltage domains. Through extensive transistor level simulations of resistive open, bridging and resistive short faults, we have classified the testing of <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> into PASSIVE and ACTIVE modes. We examine if high test coverage can be achieved in the PASSIVE mode. We consider resistive opens and shorts and show that, for testing purposes, consideration of purely digital fault effects is sufficient. Thus conventional digital DfT can be employed to test <b>level</b> <b>shifters.</b> In all cases, we conclude that using sets of single supply voltages for testing is sufficient. I...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>level</b> <b>shifter</b> in digital electronics, {{also called}} a logic-level shifter, is a circuit used to translate signals from one logic level or voltage domain to another, {{allowing}} compatibility between ICs with different voltage requirements, such as TTL and CMOS. Many modern full featured systems use level shifters to bridge domains between low-power application processors running at 1.8 V and other system functions like sensors or other analog intensive applications running at 3.3 or 5V.|$|E
50|$|By using a {{transmission}} gate to switch alternating voltages (e.g.: audio signal), the negative power supply potential must {{be lower than}} the lowest signal potential. This ensures that the substrate diode will remain non-conducting even at negative voltages. Although the transmission gate can still switch to logic voltage levels, there are special versions with integrated level shifters. A good example, is the 4053 standard chip, commonly used to select between analogue inputs to an audio amplifier, has a separate ground (pin 8) and negative substrate connection (pin 7) that also supplies the <b>level</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|E
40|$|Usage of dual supply {{voltages}} in {{a digital}} circuit is an effective way of reducing power consumption due to the quadratic relation of supply voltage to power consumption. But the need for <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> when a low voltage gate drives a high voltage gate has been a limiting factor preventing widespread usage of dual supply voltages in digital circuit design. The overhead of <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> forces designers to increase the granularity of dual voltage assignment, reducing the maximum obtainable savings. We propose a method of applying dual supply voltages at gate level granularity without using <b>level</b> <b>shifters.</b> We modify the threshold voltage of the high voltage gates that are driven by low voltage gates {{in order to obtain}} the level shifting operation together with the logic operation.

50|$|Nearly all digital {{circuits}} use a consistent logic level for all internal signals. That level, however, varies from one system to another. Interconnecting any two logic families often required special {{techniques such as}} additional pull-up resistors or purpose-built interface circuits known as level shifters. A <b>level</b> <b>shifter</b> connects one digital circuit that uses one logic level to another digital circuit that uses another logic level. Often two level shifters are used, one at each system: A line driver converts from internal logic levels to standard interface line levels; a line receiver converts from interface levels to internal voltage levels.|$|E

50|$|A {{voltage divider}} {{can be used}} as a crude logic <b>level</b> <b>shifter</b> to {{interface}} two circuits that use different operating voltages. For example, some logic circuits operate at 5V whereas others operate at 3.3V. Directly interfacing a 5V logic output to a 3.3V input may cause permanent damage to the 3.3V circuit. In this case, a voltage divider with an output ratio of 3.3/5 might be used to reduce the 5V signal to 3.3V, to allow the circuits to interoperate without damaging the 3.3V circuit. For this to be feasible, the 5V source impedance and 3.3V input impedance must be negligible, or they must be constant and the divider resistor values must account for their impedances. If the input impedance is capacitive, a purely resistive divider will limit the data rate. This can be roughly overcome by adding a capacitor in series with the top resistor, to make both legs of the divider capacitive as well as resistive.|$|E

There is however still very limited power available, and power reduction is considered increasingly important. A theoretical and practical analysis of EPD, Thin-Film Transistor, and <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> have been used to investigate power reduction techniques. The area of interest is the sub-circuits where <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> are adopted. These sub-circuits typically carry over 60 % of the total power consumption during an electronic paper write cycle.

This work is aimed at finding a generalised delay testing method for MVD. There has been little work to date on testing such systems, but testing the smallest number of operating voltages reduces testing costs. In the initial stage, the impact of varying supply voltage on different types of physical defects is analysed. Simulation results indicate that it is neces- sary to conduct test at more than one operating voltage and the lowest operating voltage does not necessarily give the best fault coverage. The second part of this work {{is related to the}} issues in the testing of <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> in a MVD environment. The testing of <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> was analysed to determine if high test coverage can be achieved at a single supply voltage. Resistive opens and shorts were considered and it was shown that, for testing purposes, consideration of purely digital fault effects is sufficient. Multiple faults were also considered.

The proposed supply-voltage-control scheme detects the critical path {{in real time}} with small overheads by exploiting features of asynchronous architectures. In an FPGA based on the proposed supply-voltage-control scheme, logic blocks on the sub-critical path are autonomously switched to a lower supply voltage to reduce the power consumption without system performance degradation. Moreover, {{in order to reduce}} the overheads of <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> used at the power domain interface, a look-up-table without <b>level</b> <b>shifters</b> is employed. Because of the small overheads of the proposed supply-voltage-control scheme and the power domain interface, the granularity size of the power domain in the proposed FPGA is as fine as a single four-input logic block.
