50|$|Lauric acid or systematically, dodecanoic acid, is a {{saturated}} {{fatty acid}} with a 12-carbon atom chain, thus having many properties of medium chain fatty acids, is a white, powdery solid with a faint odor of baby oil or soap. The salts and esters of lauric acid are known as <b>laurates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} fatty acids, lauric acid is inexpensive, {{has a long}} shelf-life, is {{non-toxic}} and is safe to handle. It is used mainly {{for the production of}} soaps and cosmetics. For these purposes, lauric acid is reacted with sodium hydroxide to give sodium <b>laurate,</b> which is a soap. Most commonly, sodium <b>laurate</b> is obtained by saponification of various oils, such as coconut oil. These precursors give mixtures of sodium <b>laurate</b> and other soaps.|$|E
50|$|Important {{contributions}} to the arts include the works of Eugène Py, considered the founding pioneer of Argentine cinema, {{as well as the}} development of new literary genres by writers like Paul Groussac or Julio Cortázar. In the field of science, two Argentine Nobel Prize laurates were of French descent, Bernardo Houssay, 1947 <b>laurate</b> in Medicine, and Luis Federico Leloir, 1970 <b>laurate</b> in Chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Resembling coconut oil, {{palm kernel}} oil is packed with {{myristic}} and lauric fatty acids and therefore suitable for the manufacture of soaps, washing powders and personal care products. Lauric acid is important in soap making: a good soap must contain at least 15 per cent <b>laurate</b> for quick lathering, while soap made for use in sea water is based on virtually 100 per cent <b>laurate.</b>|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{properties}} of soaps are of importance because of their common use as detergents, {{in the preparation of}} vaccines, in the treatment of disease, and because of their natural occurrence in the animal body where they may have some effect in deter-mining the resistance of the animal organism to infection. Reichenbach (1908) studied the action of soaps on Escherichia coli and found that potassium stearate, pahmitate, and myristate were effective in killing this organism, while the oleate, erucate, and linoleate were inactive. Walker (1924 - 1926) showed that sodium and potassium soaps of the same acid did not vary greatly in their germicidal action. The lower members of the series such as the butyrate, valerate, caprylate, and caproate, had little or no germicidal effect. He found the pneumococcus to be very susceptible to <b>laurates,</b> oleates linoleates, and linolenates. Streptococci were killed much like the pneumococci but at higher concentrations of the soap. Escherichia coli, Eberthella typhi, Shigella paradysenteriae, Sal-monella paratyphi were killed by moderate concentrations (N/ 20 to N/ 40) of the saturated soaps (<b>laurates</b> to stearates) but were very resistant to the unsaturated soaps. Eggerth (1926 - 1931) studied the germicidal action of alpha substituted soaps. He found that the soaps of the alpha bromo fatty acids were usually more germicidal than the unsubstituted. The alpha hydroxy soaps exhibited a high germicidal activit...|$|R

The effectiveness of these salts depends upon the electronegativlty of the metal ion and even more on the hard acid character. The size of the cation also plays an important part, and metal stearates are found to be more effective in blocking the zip elimin-ation of hydrochloric acid as compared to the corresponding palmitates and <b>laurates</b> due to their relatively large sizes.

50|$|In {{the early}} history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the <b>laurates</b> were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for {{creating}} a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize {{was the fact that the}} Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.|$|R
40|$|The {{solubility}} of {{alkaline earth}} <b>laurates</b> was studied in aqueous solutions {{as a function}} of temperature.

5000|$|Mirash Ivanaj {{was born}} on 12 March 1891, in Podgorica, Principality of Montenegro, in an Albanian family which had {{migrated}} there from Begaj-Triesh region. Ivanaj finished the high school in Belgrade 1910 and later went to Italy where he studied in the University of Rome where he <b>laurated</b> in two branches, in Philosophy-Literature and Law. In 1923 {{he came back to}} Albania where together with his cousin Nikollë Ivanaj, published the newspaper [...] "Bashkimi". When the June Revolution of 1924 led by Fan Noli gave the power to the opposition forces in Albanian Parliament, Ivanaj left the country. He came back in the end of 1924 when Ahmet Zog returned to power. He was appointed director of Shkodër High School and due to his growing reputation he became Minister of Education in 1933. At that period the education system was rather chaotic. Ivanaj tried to homogenize it. He began nationalizing foreign schools and Albanian government was put under pressure for his policy, especially from Italian fascist government. In September 1934 he introduced the new law on Education making elementary education as obligatory for five years. He created also various secondary education Institutes. The [...] "Education Law", nicknamed [...] "Ivanaj's Law" [...] was the most important and complete law of Albania in that period. Its purpose was to create an integrated national educational system in Albania. In summer 1935 he resigned from his post when he realized that he could not achieved what he wanted with limitation of the budget for the education. He was appointed head of Council of State, a post he kept until the occupation of Albania from Italy in April 1939. Together with his friends Safet Butka and Qemal Butka he mobilized the Albanian students in protests prior to Italian invasion. When the country was occupied, together with Qemal Butka and his brother Martin Ivanaj, he left for Turkey. During his migration in various countries he lost his brother. In October 1945 he returned to Albania. At first he was welcomed by Enver Hoxha and he was appointed teacher at Tirana High School, an institute created by Ivanaj itself when he was a Minister. In May 1947 he was arrested and was sentenced to seven years in prison on accusations of being an [...] "Imperialist agent". He died on 22 September 1953 in Tirana Hospital during a simple operation, a few days from his release date.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{exponential}} growth of scientific literature, interdisciplinary nature of research, and trend towards specialization have posed many problems {{both to the}} scientists and librarians. The extensive investigations and the abundance of literature being published and contributed to immense escalation of cost for the libraries, as the acquisition of published literature became an increasingly difficult task. To maintain a reasonable collection of periodicals, at least in broad fields, {{it is necessary for}} the librarians to know the characteristics of subject literature used by the users. Information is not only increasing exponentiality but the growth rates also differ from one discipline to another. The multiplicity of journals, the constraints of limited financial resources and the ever increasing needs of user community necessitated the librarians to develop need based information resources and services to meet the literature requirements of psychologists. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of subject literature used by scientists is important for planning and designing of information system relating to a particular field. Bibliometric techniques are used for a variety of purposes like determination of various scientific indicators, evaluation of scientific output, selection of journals for libraries and even forecasting potential Nobel <b>Laurates.</b> Bibliometric analysis has become a well established part of information research. The most obvious use of bibliometric data is to improve bibliographic control, as it is clearly not possible to provide efficient secondary services without knowing the size and characteristics of a literature. Bibliometrics has grown out of the realization that literature is growing and changing at a rate which no librarian or information worker equipped with traditional bibliographic methods and skills could keep abreast. The popularity in the adoption of bibliometric techniques in various disciplines stimulated stupendous growth in literature on bibliometrics and its related areas. The present research is undertaken to analyse the characteristics of literature used by researchers in the field of psychology as a whole and sub-fields of psychology. The present study will help the scientists and librarians in the selection of core journals and other sources in psychology. Objectives The following are the objectivess of the study To know the various sources of information consulted by the researchers in psychology; To observe the nature of authorship pattern in the literature of psychology; To examine the core journals of psychology; To trace the core book and journal publishers of psychology; To study the distribution of citations by subject, country of origin and language; To examine the applicability of Bradford 2 ̆ 7 s Law of scattering to the pattern of journals used by the researchers in psychology; To find the obsolescence of literature used; and To assess the availability of the cited journal articles and journals in the library of Sri Venkateswara University, Osmania University and Andhra University...|$|R
