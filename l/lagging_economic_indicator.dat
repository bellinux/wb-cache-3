40|$|Excerpt] After {{the long}} {{economic}} expansion that characterized {{much of the}} current decade, the nation entered its eleventh postwar recession in December 2007. The unemployment rate, which is a <b>lagging</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicator,</b> did not start to rise until May 2008 when it jumped 0. 5 percentage points to 5. 5 %. By December 2008, the unemployment rate exceeded 7. 0 % and well over 600, 000 jobs were lost—the biggest monthly decrease since December 1974, when another deep recession was taking place. These labor market indicators and comments equating the latest recession to the Great Depression intensified congressional interest in passage of legislation early in 2009 aimed at encouraging creation of new jobs and warding off further loss of jobs. (See CRS Report R 40655, The Labor Market During the Great Depression and the Current Recession.) To mitigate all but one recession since the 1960 s, Congress chose to increase federal spending on infrastructure. (See CRS Report 92 - 939, Countercyclical Job Creation Programs.) But, {{there are a number}} of issues associated with using expenditures on public works to quickly create jobs in times of recession. (See CRS Report R 40107, The Role of Public Works Infrastructure in Economic Stimulus.) Public works expenditures traditionally have gone chiefly to construction activities (e. g., building highways and bridges, dams and flood control structures) which indirectly increase demand in industries that supply their products to construction firms (e. g., manufacturing). Today, the definition of infrastructure has been expanded to include green jobs, which include those in industries that utilize renewable resources (e. g., electricity generated by wind), produce energy-efficient goods and services (e. g., mass transit), and install energy-conserving products (e. g., retrofitting buildings with thermal-pane windows). A question that typically arises during congressional consideration of economic stimulus legislation is which approach produces the most bang for the buck. In the instant case, this means how many jobs might be supported by federal expenditures on traditional and green infrastructure projects. Once stimulus legislation is signed into law, the focus of Congress customarily turns to estimates of the number of jobs that result as federal funds are allocated to specific activities. Therefore, after briefly examining the trend in employment and unemployment since the recession’s onset, the report turns to an in-depth look at estimates of job creation, including the limitations of the methodology often used to derive them and the difficulties associated with developing job estimates for green infrastructure in particular. The report closes with a review of what is known to date about the number of jobs supported by infrastructure spending among other provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P. L. 111 - 5). Section 1512 requires entities that receive ARRA appropriations from federal agencies, totaling approximately $ 271 billion, to include in quarterly reports the number of jobs created or maintained as a result. Section 1513 requires the Council of Economic Advisors to report quarterly on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment and other economic indicators...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} predict {{business}} cycle activity is an invaluable skill for governments {{and policy makers}} alike, especially before an economy enters a downturn. We analyse causality relationships between key leading <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> and <b>economic</b> growth for three countries from 1970 to 2010. We find that while many indicators do not help explain current movements in GDP growth, lags of these indicators do. In addition, {{the direction of the}} change {{and the size of the}} change in the <b>lagged</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> are very important in many cases. This is particularly true for housing indicators. business cycles, leading indicators, composite indicators, symmetric and asymmetric granger causality, co-integration,...|$|R
40|$|Indices of {{business}} and consumer sentiment receive widespread media coverage and are closely watched by market economists despite their limited success as leading indicators. In this paper we ask what explains ‘sentiment’ and find that <b>lagged</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> (such as changes in GDP, job vacancies and the cash rate) can explain a substantial proportion {{of the variation in}} a number of backward and forward-looking sentiment indices. This does not {{rule out the possibility that}} they may be useful for forecasting. We find, however, that when currently available economic information is appropriately ‘filtered’ from the sentiment indices, in most cases they fail even rudimentary Granger-causality tests of predictive ability. On a more positive note, we find that the Roy Morgan consumer confidence rating, NAB actual business conditions, NAB expected employment outlook over the next three months and the second question in the Roy Morgan and Westpac/MI consumer surveys all provide some, albeit small, contribution to forecasting employment growth. The second question of both consumer confidence surveys (which asks about anticipated personal financial conditions over the coming year) also appears to have some ability to predict recessions. Outside of these results there is little evidence that the surveys tell us anything we didn’t already know. Thus, there is reason to suspect that surveyed respondents’ forecasts offer little more information about the future path of the economy than a weighted average of <b>lagged</b> <b>economic</b> variables. business; confidence; consumer; forecasting; predictive ability; sentiment; survey...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} national total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{rates by}} economic factors, {{and the extent}} to which differences in insurance coverage, income, and assets contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in TKA use. DATA SOURCE: US longitudinal Health and Retirement Study survey data for the elderly and near-elderly (biennial rounds 1994 - 2004) from the Institute of Social Research, University of Michigan. STUDY DESIGN: The outcome is dichotomous, whether the respondent received first TKA in the previous 2 years. Longitudinal, random-effects logistic regression models are used to assess associations with <b>lagged</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators.</b> SAMPLE: Sample was 55, 469 person-year observations from 18, 439 persons; 663, with first TKA. RESULTS: Racial/ethnic disparities in TKA were more prominent among men than women. For example, relative to white women, odds ratios (ORs) were 0. 94, 0. 46, and 0. 79, for white, black, and Hispanic men, respectively (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 for black men). After adjusting for economic factors, racial/ethnic differences in TKA rates for women essentially disappeared, while the deficit for black men remained large. Among Medicare-enrolled elderly, those with supplemental insurance may be more likely to have first TKA compared with those without it, whether the supplemental coverage was private [OR: 1. 27; 95...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{a system of}} leading, coincident, and <b>lagging</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> first {{developed}} in the 1930 s by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), has been widely used in the United States to appraise {{the state of the}} business cycle. Since 1961 the current monthly figures for these indicators have been published by the U. S. Department of Commerce in Business Conditions Digest. Similar systems have been developed by government or private agencies in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and more recently in many other countries. A few years ago the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set up a working party to develop this type of analysis and most of the member countries participated. The Center for International Business Cycle Research at Rutgers University has given guidance in this field to some fifteen countries during the past three years, in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Our purpose in this paper is to explain briefly the theory and rationale underlying this approach to economic forecasting, describe the more important statistical procedures used, and review the evidence on how the indicators have performed in practice. The tests of performance concentrate on data not used in the selection of the indicators, in the United States and nine other countries. We conclude with some suggestions for future research and development, including the application of the approach to the analysis of inflation. ...|$|R

This entails implementing more effective measures related to knowledge transfer and technical support, as well as applying innovative catalytic instruments to generate more economic and social value...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{variability}} and {{a substantial}} {{fraction of the}} most recent temperature warming in the Northern Hemisphere can be accounted for by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The most pronounced anomalies have occurred since the winter of 1989, with significant implications on weather conditions in areas within the index's geographical scope. Because climate {{is one of the most}} important factors in explaining world movements by humans, in this paper, variability patterns between quarterly Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), compiled by the European Airline Association, and the NAO index are investigated as a function of different time <b>lags</b> and diverse <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> with the aim of evaluating the impact of NAO variability and trends that can be associated with the change in RPK since the nineties. Using a traditional international air travel demand model, it has been found that the dissociation of the NAO index into positive and negative fluctuations can be related to changes in different geographical RPK time series, once seasonal effects are removed. The results are consistent with the view that meteorological and climate conditions can act as both a pull and push factor. NAO, tourism, travel, climate change, airline industry...|$|R
