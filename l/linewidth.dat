25|$|An informal, {{heuristic}} {{meaning of}} the principle is the following: A state that only exists {{for a short time}} cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in spectroscopy, excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, {{they do not have a}} definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the natural <b>linewidth.</b> Fast-decaying states have a broad <b>linewidth,</b> while slow decaying states have a narrow <b>linewidth.</b>|$|E

25|$|With {{the natural}} Poisson {{distribution}} {{due to the}} random arrival and absorption times of the photons, there is an expected natural dose (photon number) variation of at least several percent 3 sigma, making the exposure process susceptible to stochastic variations. The dose variation leads to {{a variation of the}} feature edge position, effectively becoming a blur component. Unlike the hard resolution limit imposed by diffraction, shot noise imposes a softer limit, with the main guideline being the ITRS line width roughness (LWR) spec of 8% (3s) of <b>linewidth.</b> Increasing the dose will reduce the shot noise, but this also requires higher source power.|$|E
25|$|The {{drawbacks}} of {{this technology}} are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which {{is proportional to the}} distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection <b>linewidth.</b> (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.|$|E
