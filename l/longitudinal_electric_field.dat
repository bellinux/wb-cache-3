40|$|The {{dynamics}} of two initially unmagnetized relativistic counter-streaming homogeneous ion-electron plasma beams are simulated in two dimensions using the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. It is shown that current filaments, which form {{due to the}} Weibel instability, develop a large scale <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the direction opposite to the current carried by the filaments as predicted by theory. Fast moving ions in the current filaments decelerate due to this <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> The same <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> which is partially inductive and partially electrostatic, is identified as {{the main source of}} acceleration of electrons in the current filaments. The transverse electric field, though larger than the longitudinal one, is shown to play a smaller role in heating electrons, contrary to previous claims. It is found that, in 1 D, the electrons become strongly magnetized and are not accelerated beyond their initial kinetic energy. Rather, the heating of the electrons is enhanced by the bending and break-up of the filaments, which releases electrons that would otherwise be trapped within a single filament and hence slow the development of the Weibel instability (i. e. the magnetic field growth) via induction as per Lenz's law. In 2 D simulations electrons are heated to about one quarter of the initial kinetic energy of ions. The magnetic energy at maximum is about 4 percent, decaying to less than 1 percent {{by the end of the}} simulation. Most of the heating of electrons takes place while the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is still growing while only a small portion of the heating is a result of subsequent magnetic field decay.

The {{first part of the}} paper describes an experiment which investigates the effect of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> on the spin-polarized carriers induced by a circularly polarized light. Since the photo-generated hole spins relaxation is extremely fast, the experiment observes only the effect resulting from spin-polarized electrons accumulating at the transverse edges of the sample, as a result of left-right asymmetries in scattering for spin-up and spin-down electrons in the presence of spin-orbit (SO) interaction.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a longitudinally cold, charged-particle beam can be simulated {{by dividing the}} beam into slices and calculating {{the motion of the}} slice boundaries due to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> generated by the beam.

In contrast to the g-factor model, it can be shown analytically that the repulsive electric field of a slice compressed to zero length is bounded.

40|$|The microbunching {{instability}} usually {{exists in}} the LINAC of a free electron laser (FEL) facility. In many cases, the longitudinal space charge (LSC) is a dominant factor that generates the instability. For the highly bright electron beams, the plasma effect {{is found to be}} non-trivial {{in the development of the}} instability. In this paper, starting from the Vlasov and Poisson equations in the multiple-dimensional phase space, we perform the straightforward analysis of the microbunching instability based on the explicit formula of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> introduced by the density perturbation in the longitudinal direction, in such a way to be highly comparable to the well-developed method for higher energy beams. This method generally applies in both the cases with and without acceleration and independent of lattice components. The results show that for a electron beam with small transverse emittance at low energies, which is always the case in the injector of a free electron laser device, the plasma effect results in the oscillation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the modified plasma frequency that depends on the transverse size of the beam, and the Landau damping effect in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> due to the uncorrelated longitudinal velocity spread during the beam transportation. These two effects both play important roles in the development of the instability. As the result, the energy modulation driven by the LSC impedance differs from the regular value significantly and the discrepancy leads to the noticeable change of the final gain of the instability.
