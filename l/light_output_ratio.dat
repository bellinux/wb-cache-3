40|$|A {{batch of}} 16 CsI(TI) {{scintillator}} crystals, {{supplied by the}} Bicron Company, has been studied with respect to precise energy calibration in pulse-shape identification technique. The light corresponding to pulse integration within the time interval 1. 6 - 4. 5 mus (long gate) and 0. 0 - 4. 5 mus (extra-long gate) exhibits a power law relation, L(E, Z, A) a 1 (Z, A) Ea 2 (Z- 4), for (1. 2. 3) H isotopes in the measured energy range 5 - 150 MeV. For the time interval 0. 0 - 0. 60 mus (short gate), a significant deviation from the power law relation is observed, for energy greater than similar to 30 MeV. The character of the a 2 (p) -a 2 (d) and a 2 (p) -a 2 (t) correlations for protons, deuterons and tritons, reveals 3 types of crystals in the batch. These subbatches differ {{in the value of}} the extracted parameter a 2 for protons, and {{in the value of the}} spread of a 2 for deuterons and tritons. This may be explained by the difference in the energy dependence of the fast decay time component and/or by the difference in the <b>light</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> of the fast/slow components. An accuracy well inside 1. 0 % is achieved in the energy calibration of the CsI(TI) crystals by using the DeltaE(Si) E(CsI(Tl)) /PMT method. The batch of 16 CsI(TI) crystals is utilized to measure the correlations of light charged particles produced in E/A = 61 MeV, (36) Arinduced reactions. The preliminary correlation functions for two protons with small relative momenta are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is {{daylight}} in buildings. More specifically, the thesis presents {{studies on the}} performance characteristics of venetian blinds used on the interior side of vertical windows. A particular emphasis is put on the daylighting properties of different blind types, {{and the performance of}} daylight redirecting blinds is compared to the performance of traditional white blinds. Three factors are highly important for daylight in buildings: the daylight source, the optical properties of the fenestration or daylighting system, and the characteristics of the architectural space that receives the daylight. Earlier works on daylighting systems in buildings have often documented the daylight levels and the daylight distribution within the space. With that approach {{it can be hard to}} pinpoint exactly why one daylighting system performs differently from another. For the work presented here it has been a goal to focus on the properties of the fenestration system itself, while operating under various daylight conditions that are relevant for high latitudes. Some assumptions have been made regarding the architectural space (sidelighted with an elevated daylight opening), but apart from this it has been sought to describe the system performance more or less independently from the architectural space. This approach can be compared to the approach that has been used in the field of electric lighting. There, luminaries are typically specified by performance characteristics that are not depending on the space in which they are to be applied. For electric luminaries, photometric properties such as luminous flux, light distribution and <b>light</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> are commonly used to describe the performance of the luminaire, and these values are independent of the space where the luminaire is to be used. In other words, in this thesis, the venetian blind system is treated more or less as a “daylight luminaire”. The main tool applied to analyse the photometric properties of the “daylight luminaire” is Monte Carlo forward ray tracing. The software TracePro is used extensively for this purpose. This software tool is tailor-made for analysing optical systems (including luminaries). Unfortunately, daylight sources are not available in TracePro. For this reason, a substantial effort was made in order to generate TracePro light sources that represent the light from ground, sky and sun. However, once these sources were established and validated, many positive features of the program could be utilised with good effect in order to quantify a variety of different photometric characteristics (e. g. transmittance, light distribution and luminance) of venetian blind systems. In order to analyse these characteristics in a systematic manner the fundamental geometrical properties of venetian blinds need to be understood and these properties have therefore been derived and described. A new evaluation method for daylight redirection systems is presented in this thesis. This method is based on quantification of performance metrics already applied for such systems combined with new performance indicators suggested on the basis of literature findings as well as own studies of venetian blind performance. The main goal of the new method is to provide a tool that can be used to indicate performance of a particular system with respect to 8 different important criteria that are determined by the properties of the daylighting system: (1) supply of daylight, (2) room darkening, (3) light distribution, (4) glare protection, (5) outward view, (6) privacy protection, (7) solar heat supply, and (8) overheating protection. Star diagrams are used to provide a graphical illustration of the performance of the systems, where each of the 8 star points represents one of the 8 performance criteria used to evaluate the system. The new evaluation method has been applied in order to compare the performance of traditional white blinds with that of daylight redirecting blinds. The results show that, when both blinds are operated in the semi-closed position, the performance is roughly the same for all of the performance criteria considered. However, when both blind types are operated in the open blind position, the daylight redirecting blind can perform better with respect to daylight supply and light distribution. The results presented in this thesis also show that these benefits can be obtained without worsening the performance with respect to the other criteria. The performance of blinds has been studied for daylight conditions that are representative for high latitudes. It has sometimes been argued that, due to the typical low sun conditions, especially during the winter months, daylight redirecting blinds are less suitable at high latitudes. However, results presented in this thesis show that daylight redirecting blinds can function very well under most sun conditions that are typical for high latitudes, provided that the spacing to width ratio is carefully selected.

The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving <b>light</b> <b>output</b> less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure.

40|$|The paper assesses {{capital stock}} and capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for major {{branches}} {{of the economy and}} selected industries. It {{is an important part of}} the research effort to determine historical rates of economic and technological change, especially those related to energy systems and their environmental impacts. The composition of capital stock and its vintage structure are a good measure and determinant of rates of change. Furthermore, the analysis presented in this paper may be useful for estimating the capital input required for production of goods and services at given levels of output. The capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> could also enhance understanding of the selection mechanism operating among industries with varying capital productivity. The first part of the paper analyzes the composition and distribution of capital stock within the economies of the US, UK, and the FRG. It is not surprising that the share of capital stock in different sectors shows the known development of investment and employment. In the last 25 years the share of fixed assets invested in agriculture decreased and the share of the national capital stock invested in services increased. The development in major branches and industries shows that transport (due to the decreased importance of railroads as a means of transportation) declined, whereas public utilities and construction comprised a stable proportion of the capital stock and finance/insurance/real estate and other services, excluding government, absorbed an increasing part of the national capital stock. The second part of the study tries to determine common features of capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> economy wide and for major branches and selected industries. It can be concluded that there are some similarities for the US, UK and the FRG. For example, during the 1980 s, capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for the economy as a whole but excluding residential were found to be quite similar for the US, UK and the FRG, in that they varied only between 2. 5 and 2. 8. Over a longer time frame, the US capital <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> was relatively constant whereas the capital <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> in the FRG increased by 50 percent in less than 30 years (from 1. 8 in 1960 to 2. 7 in 1987). This trend is consistent with an earlier investigation (Doblin, 1978), that showed growing capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for the 1960 s and 1970 s in the FRG (enterprises, excluding residential) as well as the UK (1964 - 1974). At the major branch level, a constant figure over the entire time frame was found for the US, UK and FRG capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for manufacturing, construction, trade, and finance/insurance/real estate. For the other branches, no common trend could be established. Furthermore, the ranking of the capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> shows clearly that public utilities have the highest, and construction the lowest, capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios.</b> The absolute level is similar in all three countries for construction (0. 5 - 0. 9) and in the US and the FRG for manufacturing (1. 7 - 2. 0). Another interesting fact is that in the three countries, the deviation from the average was found to be the same for a number of industries. Capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> were above the national average for agriculture, public utilities, transport, and communication; and below the average for manufacturing (with the exception of the UK), construction, trade and finance. With regard to observations at industry level, motor vehicles and equipment, stone/clay/glass, and radios/televisions showed a deterioration of capital productivity, whereas in chemical and allied industries the reverse happened. Food/drink, non-electric and electric machinery (with the exception of the FRG), and paper are rather constant. As regards the magnitude of the coefficients it could only be said that the railroads had the highest capital <b>output</b> <b>ratio.</b> Capital <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> above the national average were also found for chemical and allied industries, and radios/televisions; and below average for non-electric and electric machinery...|$|R
