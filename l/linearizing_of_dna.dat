Generation and isolation of stable transfectants from the large pool of untransfected or only transiently transfected cells can be laborious and time-consuming. Transfection <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> is usually performed with a non-linearized plasmid, since {{it is assumed that}} cutting the plasmid beforehand leads to a lower efficiency of transfection or the degradation <b>of</b> <b>linearized</b> <b>DNA</b> by cytosolic nucleases.

Examination of the reaction products indicates that the ATP dependence of transcription from a linear template is not due to an ATPase activity or to the premature termination of transcription at low ATP concentration. These data suggest that the initiation of transcription by SP 6 RNA polymerase requires partial denaturation of the template in the promoter-proximal region, and that this requirement can be satisfied by negative supercoiling or by increasing the ATP concentration.

The BRCA 1 protein becomes phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, but the effects of phosphorylation on recombinational repair are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the BRCA 1 -mediated regulation of recombination requires the Chk 2 - and ATM-dependent phosphorylation sites.

Similar results were obtained when endogenous Chk 2 kinase activity was inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative Chk 2 mutant. Surprisingly, the opposing regulation of HR and NHR did not require the ATM phosphorylation sites on serines 1423 and 1524.

In general, the integration frequencies observed in strains containing a wild-type region, a 1 -kilobase (kb) deletion, or a 5 -kb insertion were similar, provided that the cleavage site in the plasmid DNA was present in the host genome. Cleavage at a plasmid DNA site corresponding to a region deleted in the chromosome caused a 10 -fold reduction in the integration frequency even when the site was close to regions of homology. However, although the integration frequency was normal even when cleavage occurred only 25 base pairs (bp) outside the deletion breakpoint, 98 % of the events were associated not with the usual heterogenote structure, but instead with a homogenote structure containing two copies of the deletion allele separated by vector sequences. Similarly, when cleavage occurred 80 bp outside the 5 -kb substitution breakpoint, 40 % of the integration events were associated with homogenote structures. From these observations, I suggest that exonuclease and polymerase activities are not rate-limiting steps in double-strand-break repair, exonuclease activity is coupled to the initiation step, the integration frequency is strongly influenced {{by the amount of}} homology near the recombinogenic ends, both ends <b>of</b> a linear <b>DNA</b> molecule might interact with the host chromosome before significant exonuclease or polymerase action, and the average repair tract is about 600 bp...|$|R

Using a non-invasive solution method (dynamic light scattering), we investigated the effect of permanently curved inserts on the solution structure and on the internal motions <b>of</b> superhelical plasmid <b>DNA.</b> We find that the dynamics <b>of</b> superhelical <b>DNA</b> are strongly influenced by sequence- or protein-induced bending: in superhelical plasmids containing curved inserts the amplitude of the internal motion is {{lower than that of}} non-curved controls. Furthermore, the relative arrangement of curved sequences in the plasmids can influence the overall shape <b>of</b> the superhelical <b>DNA.</b> On <b>linearized</b> forms <b>of</b> the plasmids, these effects are not observed...|$|R
