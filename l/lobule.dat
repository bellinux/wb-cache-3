5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each <b>lobule</b> consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical <b>lobule)</b> is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E

5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital <b>lobule</b> in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
25|$|When {{most of the}} alar <b>lobule</b> {{tissue is}} missing, the nose collapses; the {{correction}} is with an ear concha cartilage-graft harvested from the antihelix, a donor site where the cartilage is most rigidly curved, thus is ideal for replacing an alar <b>lobule.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{appropriate}} surgical {{management of}} an alar <b>lobule</b> defect {{depends upon the}} dimensions (length, width, depth) of the wound. Anatomically, the nasal skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar <b>lobule</b> form a semi-rigid aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim, and provides unobstructed airflow through the nostrils, the anterior nares.|$|E
5000|$|A mammary {{alveolus}} (plural: alveoli, from Latin alveolus, [...] "little cavity") {{is a small}} cavity or sac {{found in}} the mammary gland. Mammary alveoli are the site of milk production and storage in the mammary gland. Mammary alveoli cluster into groups called <b>lobules,</b> and each breast may contain 15-20 of these <b>lobules.</b> The <b>lobules</b> drain milk through the lactiferous ducts out of the nipples.|$|R
40|$|These 4 {{types of}} <b>lobules</b> are also metabolically {{different}} and have different breast cancer poten-tial. Type 1 & 2 <b>lobules</b> have more estrogen and proges-terone receptors than Type 3 which {{cause them to}} grow through mitosis (cell division) when estrogen and progesterone levels are elevated. Mitosis requires repli-cation of DNA (genes) and therefore can result in muta-tions. Mutated cells also undergo mitosis. Multiple mutations can cause cancer cells to form. Cells of Type 1 & 2 lob-ules also multiply faster than Type 3 resulting in more chances for mutations to occur. This growth (proliferation) under estrogen and progesterone stimula-tion explains the cancer causing properties of estrogen/ progestin combination drugs. Type 1 <b>lobules</b> are where ductal cancers start. These account for at least 85 % of all breast cancers. Type 2 <b>lobules</b> are where lobular cancers start. These account for about 12 % of all breast cancers. Type 3 <b>lobules</b> are cancer resistant when they {{are the result of}} the regression of Type 4 <b>lobules</b> after birth and weaning.

40|$|Epidemiological, clinical, and {{experimental}} {{data indicate that}} the risk of developing breast cancer is strongly dependent on the ovary and on endocrine conditions modulated by ovarian function, such as early menarche, late menopause, and parity. Women who gave birth to a child when they were younger than 24 years of age exhibit a decrease in their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and additional pregnancies increase the protection. The breast tissue of normally cycling women contains three identifiable types of <b>lobules,</b> the undifferentiated <b>Lobules</b> type 1 (Lob 1) and the more developed <b>Lobules</b> type 2 and <b>Lobules</b> type 3. The breast attains its maximum development during pregnancy and lactation (<b>Lobules</b> type 4). After menopause the breast regresses in both nulliparous and parous women containing only Lob 1.

25|$|Nasal skin defects can be {{corrected}} with a medially based bilobed flap, which is emplaced {{to provide adequate}} skin coverage for wounds limited to the alar <b>lobule.</b> If the entire <b>lobule</b> is missing, it might be necessary to leave the second-lobe donor-site wound partially open; it will close at 2–4 weeks post-operative; afterwards, the scar can be revised. Nonetheless, the alternative surgical correction is a two-stage, superiorly based, nasolabial flap.|$|E

25|$|If the alar <b>lobule</b> defect also comprehends {{the lateral}} {{wall of the}} nose, the defect can be closed either with a superiorly based nasolabial-flap or with a {{forehead}} flap. If the cheek skin is thin and atrophic, a nasolabial flap is the recommended reconstruction; otherwise, a forehead flap is recommended, because the thickness of forehead skin is a superior match for nasal skin and tissue. Mucosal lining defects of the alar <b>lobule</b> can be resurfaced with a bipedicled mucosal advancement-flap harvested from inside the lateral wall of the nose. Likewise, larger defects of the mucosa do require correction with an anteriorly based septal mucosal flap.|$|E

25|$|Fibroadenomas, are benign breast tumours {{characterized}} by an admixture of stromal and epithelial tissue.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a {{malignant}} tumor that develops from {{the cells of the}} breast. It is {{the most common type of}} cancer among women in the United States.

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 <b>lobules</b> {{quickly become}} type 2 <b>lobules</b> because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 <b>lobules</b> requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 <b>lobules</b> than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|R

The respective external valve of each nose is variably dependent upon the size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Darker-staining cells form {{clusters}} called acini, {{which are}} arranged in lobes separated by a thin fibrous barrier. The secretory cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct. Because of their secretory function, these cells have many small granules of zymogens that are visible. The intercalated ducts drain into larger ducts within the <b>lobule,</b> and finally interlobular ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium. With increasing diameter, several layers of columnar cells may be seen.|$|E

25|$|A {{wound in}} the lateral nasal wall that is greater than 15nbsp&mm in {{diameter}} can also be corrected with a superiorly based, nasolabial-flap, which is especially suited for correcting distal defects that lay among the convexities of the nasal tip and the alar <b>lobule.</b> The nasolabial flap can correct defects that comprehend the distal two-thirds of the nose, {{if there is a}} supply of skin sufficient for constructing the base of the flap pedicle; and the donor sites cannot be closed primarily. Yet, bulkiness is the principal disadvantage of the nasolabial flap—except in elderly patients with atrophic cheek skin; nonetheless, it is technically effective for patients unsuitable for a two-stage rhinoplasty with a paramedian forehead flap.|$|E
25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar <b>lobule</b> and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|E
25|$|There are 800-1000 minor {{salivary glands}} located {{throughout}} the oral cavity within the submucosa {{of the oral}} mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the hard palate, and {{the floor of the}} mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue. They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny <b>lobule.</b> A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner glands- see next section) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion). The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{rotation}} {{is a task}} {{known to}} activate the parietal cortical regions. The present study aimed to investigate whether there is differential activation of regions within the parietal lobe and to reveal functional subspecialisation of this region by examining the effects of increasing angle of rotation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in nine healthy female subjects whilst undertaking a parametric mental rotation task. The task comprised 6 alphanumeric characters presented in their normal or mirror-reversed orientation. Behaviourally, subjects showed increased reaction times with increased angle of rotation, with differential effects between the alphanumeric characters; numbers having greater reaction times than letters. BOLD signal increase was observed bilaterally in the middle occipital gyrus and medial frontal gyrus, in the right superior and inferior parietal <b>lobules</b> and in the left superior temporal gyrus. Parametric increases in activation with increasing angle of rotation were observed bilaterally in the superior and inferior parietal <b>lobules</b> and in the right medial frontal gyrus, with greater parametric effects in the superior parietal <b>lobules</b> compared to the inferior parietal <b>lobules.</b> Our findings suggest subspecialisation of the posterior parietal <b>lobules</b> during mental rotation, with differential responses in the superior and inferior regions...|$|R
