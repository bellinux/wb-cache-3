In this context, the development and validation of a new approach using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of HDG from flaxseed cakes followed by quantification with a reverse-phase HPLC system with UV detection was purposed. The experimental parameters affecting the HDG extraction yield, such as microwave power, extraction time and sodium hydroxide concentration, from the lignan macromolecule were optimized. A maximum HDG concentration of 5. 76 mg/g DW in flaxseed cakes was measured following an irradiation time of 6 min, for a microwave power of 150 W using a direct extraction in 0. 1 M NaOH in 70 % (v/v) aqueous methanol.

Commercial activated carbons are expensive and it is the main drawback of using this adsorbent in all the application sectors (Roy et al. 2013). Recently, some of the low cost compounds such as zirconium oxide-coated marine sand, chir pine sawdust, bagasse fly ash, clay and magnetic chitosan-bamboo sawdust composites were employed while some of the biomasses were also used to remove arsenic from water (Khan and Sing 2010; 2013, 2014, Khan and Nazir 2015; Ali et al. 2014).

Feed marketing studies are scarce in Ethiopia. This study is aimed at assessing the feed marketing system in Ethiopia to generate a general understanding of the feed supply and demand characteristics, feed marketing, feed prices, market places, market actors, and market institutions. The types of fodder supplied in the country differ {{from place to place}} {{depending on the type of}} crops grown as conditioned by the agro-climatic conditions. Buyers and sellers have various perceptions about the quality of the fodder supplied to the market. There are competing uses of crop residues and hay in Ethiopia. Crop residues and hay are transported in a variety of ways. Most of the crop residues are retailed in the open market. Hay is mostly sold in situ. Agro-industrial by-products from flour and edible oil mills, grind mills and local brewery are sold in all of the study areas. There are about 15 feed mixers and millers in the country as observed during the study period. However, only five of them are manufacturing purely for sale; others produce for own consumption and to sell surpluses. Feed prices are rising sharply. Available price data indicated that there are significant price differences between farm gate and wholesale prices of crop residues and hay. Among the crop residues teff straw is most expensive.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, new {{perspectives}} for oilseed crops are open as renewable and valuable feedstocks for biorefinery processes. In fact, {{these kind of}} crops are particularly suitable for obtaining, through a cascading use of total biomass, highest added-value products, such as bio-based products and industrial materials (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, fine chemicals, cosmetics, agrochemicals, biomaterials), over bioenergy. In particular, oilseed cakes, deriving from plant oil extraction, represent interesting co-products. They are usually used as animal feed, due to their high protein and energy contents. The nutritional values of oilseed cakes as animal feed and the feed performance has been extensively studied. On the other hand, the oilseed cakes contain bioactive substances, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans and other antioxidant compounds, {{which could be used}} as food additive, supplement or cosmeceutical additive for the protection of foods and human health. However, there are only few reports about their phytochemical characteristics. In view of a cascading approach of biomass utilization, the extraction of these chemicals can be considered in order to increase the added value of these co-products. In the present study, four different oilseed crops are considered: camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz., var. Italia), linseed (Linum usitatissimum L., var. Sideral and Buenos Aires), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L., var. Pieve and Montola 2000) and crambe (Crambe abyssinica L., var. Mario 2000). They were cultivated in open field conditions, during two consecutive years (2014 and 2015), in two environments of central and northern Italy (Pisa and Bologna). After the agronomical evaluation (seed yield, harvest index, oil and protein content), the cakes, obtained from oil extraction, were chemically characterized. The content of total phenolic compounds (by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay), total flavonoids (by the aluminum-chloride method), and lignan quality profile (by HPLC-PDA/UV-ESI-MS/MS) were assessed. At the same time, the radical-scavenging activity was investigated by the DPPH method. The phytochemical characterization of the obtained seed cakes showed that these co-products contained considerable amounts of bioactive substances, varying depending on the oilseed crops. In particular, camelina seed cake showed the highest content of polyphenols and flavonoids, while safflower and linseed exhibited the strongest radical-scavenging activity. For <b>linseed</b> <b>cake,</b> the profile of lignans showed the presence of secoisolariciresinol-diglucoside as the main compound of this interesting class of chemicals. In conclusion, this study suggests that oilseed cakes from the investigated crops, due to their interesting phytochemicals and bioactive values, would be valuable candidates as functional foods and natural dietary supplements. These results, together with the good agronomic performance in terms of crop seed yield and oil content, suggest that these novel oilseed crops can be successfully introduced into the cereal based cropping systems of the tested environmental conditions, with potential agro-environmental and economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{requirements}} of ruminants are met by two sources; microbes leaving the rumen and dietary protein escaping fermentation in the rumen. Much ruminant research has therefore focused on improving amino acid {{supply to the}} duodenum by increasing both microbial protein synthesis and escape of feed proteins from the rumen. The escape of dietary protein {{is dependent on the}} degradation characteristics and retention time in the rumen. The overall aims of this thesis were to increase the knowledge of ruminal degradation of buffer soluble proteins and to investigate the effect of condensed tannins on the degradation. The thesis examines the effect of trichloroacetic acid, perchloric acid, and tungstic acid on detection and recovery of feed peptides and chemically-defined peptides. Twenty-five feeds were screened for buffer soluble protein N. In vitro ruminal degradation rates of buffer soluble proteins were estimated in 11 of these feeds. Buffer soluble protein from peas or cold-pressed rapeseed cake was given as a pulse dose together with a liquid marker to lactating dairy cows, to investigate rumen in vivo degradation rates. The concentration of condensed tannins was determined for birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), big trefoil (L. uliginosus Schkur.) and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) and related to nitrogen solubility in fresh-frozen and ensiled material and ruminal in vitro degradation. The different protein precipitants did not alter detection of peptides formed in a ruminal in vitro system. The recovery of an eight-residue peptide was 0. 66, 0. 88, and 0. 91 for tungstic acid, perchloric acid, and trichloroacetic acid, respectively. The content of soluble protein N in feeds ranged from 0 to 874 g/kg buffer soluble N with the highest contents for lupine, peas, and cold-pressed rapeseed cake. Fractional degradation rates determined in vitro for soluble protein ranged from 0. 18 (<b>linseed</b> <b>cake)</b> to 1. 0 /h (casein). Soluble protein from soybean meal, peas, and lupine were degraded at intermediate rates. Soluble proteins given as a pulse dose were rapidly degraded in vivo. Results were disturbed by slow mixing in the rumen. In several cases, concentration of the liquid marker was higher after 1 h than 0. 5 h post dosing. Based on two experiments and a total of nine varieties of birdsfoot trefoil, the concentration of condensed tannins determined by a radial diffusion method ranged from 3 to 17 g/kg DM. The tannin content for sainfoin and big trefoil was 21. 6 (maximum concentration) and 24. 8 g/kg DM, respectively. Buffer N solubility and ruminal in vitro N degradability were negatively correlated to tannin content. Tannin content and wilting time cumulatively reduced buffer soluble nitrogen in birdsfoot trefoil silage. This thesis shows that there is no distinct cut-off for peptide size when using different protein precipitation agents. Soluble proteins degrade at different rates depending on source. As they are not instantly degraded, they must contribute to the dietary amino acid supply of the ruminant. The in sacco method, which assumes complete degradation of soluble proteins should not be used for feeds high in soluble proteins...|$|E
