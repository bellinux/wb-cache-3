40|$|Working {{parents may}} miss work {{to look for}} child care, to cover for a {{breakdown}} in care, or {{to care for a}} sick child. Employers can reduce family-related absences by providing on-site child care and referral services, improving the quality and reliability of community child care centers, or increasing parents' ability to afford better care. Allowing sick <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>family</b> <b>reasons</b> does not reduce absenteeism, but it does reduce the tension associated with having to lie about the reason. There is evidence to suggest that these absences do not necessarily translate into lower productivity. Recommendations relating to the complicated relationship between work and family include: better measures, research tools, and methodologies; more pooling of firms ' anonymous needs assessments; analysis of on-site centers ' sick policies; research on parents who work nonstandard hours; work-family conflict...|$|E

40|$|The Parental Leave Directive 96 / 34 /EC is {{the only}} EU {{directive}} which was adopted with the specific aim of enabling working parents to reconcile work and family responsibilities thorough the use of parental <b>leave</b> and <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> urgent <b>family</b> <b>reasons.</b> This thesis consists of an exploration of this Directive {{in terms of how}} it shapes law at national level in the UK and Poland with references to,;;' selected Member States. The legal analysis undertaken in this thesis is informed by socio-Iegal methodologies and feminist perspectives. It aims to explore the legislative contribution of the EU to addressing the complex and diverse issues surrounding the interaction between work and caring responsibilities for children and adult dependants. At the core of this thesis is the concept of choice {{and the extent to which}} the Directive has assisted working parents in making genuine reconciliation choices. As this Directive was the first reconciliation measure to be based on a framework agreement concluded by Social Partners, the legal basis for their involvement in the EU decision making process is explored and analysed. The thesis considers whether the change in the legislative process in favour of the involvement of Social Partners, has resulted in the adoption of the Directive on parental leave containing more stringent provisions than those envisaged in the Commission proposals for a Directive on parental leave blocked by the Council in the 1980 s. It argues that the Directive has failed to provide workers with the effective rights to parental <b>leave</b> and <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> urgent <b>family</b> <b>reasons</b> which could enable them to make genuine reconciliation choices. This failure has been further reinforced by national legislators to the detriment of workers with caring responsibilities for children and adult dependants in the UK and Poland. The thesis uses a comparative legal approach in order explore the way forward for further development of the EU law by considering the approaches, rules and standards that should be adopted or reinforced in law in order to ensure that the discussed leave entitlements become more effective reconciliation tools.

40|$|This brief uses data {{collected}} by the Granite State Poll in 2016 to examine New Hampshire workers’ access to paid {{family and medical leave}} and the use of paid or unpaid <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>family</b> and medical <b>reasons.</b> Understanding who lacks access to paid family and medical leave benefits and the underlying factors contributing to differences in those who take time away from work <b>for</b> <b>family</b> caregiving is important. Without access to paid family and medical leave, New Hampshire’s working families may face barriers to financial stability, employment, and future opportunities. Author Kristin Smith reports that about one-third of New Hampshire workers have jobs without extended paid leave to tend to their own illness; about half lack access to parental leave; and two-thirds lack access to paid <b>leave</b> to care <b>for</b> an ill <b>family</b> member. Less than a third of workers have access to all three types of extended paid <b>leave</b> (<b>for</b> their own illness, parental <b>leave,</b> and care <b>for</b> a <b>family</b> member). Workers living in families earning less than $ 60, 000 a year have less access to extended paid family and medical leave benefits than do those with higher incomes. Women are less likely to have jobs that provide paid family and medical leave but are more likely to take leave. Sixty percent of employed women have taken paid or unpaid family and medical leave compared with 40 percent of employed men. New Hampshire men who know another man who has taken leave without negative consequences {{are twice as likely to}} take leave themselves compared to men who do not know another man taking leave (52 and 24 percent, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study about {{character}} development of the main character, Delia Grinstead in Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years. In the novel, Delia Grinstead, makes a provocative decision by <b>leaving</b> her <b>family.</b> <b>For</b> this <b>reason,</b> the thesis writer is curious to analyze what reasons that make Delia leave her family and how her leaving finally enables Delia to gain character development and also to change her idea toward her family. Therefore, this thesis intends to prove that there are reasons that cause Delia to leave her family and that her leaving finally changes her character and idea toward her family. Furthermore, {{in order to make}} an analysis on the reasons of Delia's leaving and Delia's character development, the thesis writer will apply literary device namely theory of characterization. In addition, she will add the definition of key term of escape and psychological theory on human relations to support the analysis. From the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that Delia's background of lacking social life and her weakness in facing problems affect her relationship with her <b>family.</b> Another <b>reason</b> why Delia leaves her family is because Delia wants to escape from her problem that is her bad relationship with her family. However, during her escape, Delia undergoes character development through the improvement of her social life. Further, her wrong idea toward her family is also changed since Delia can have an open communication with her family so that she can renew her relationship with her family and Delia returns to her family finally...|$|R

Less is understood about migration from high-income countries. Recession has impacted several European countries in recent years, {{and in some}} cases emigration has reached unprecedented levels. This study measures and explores the predictors of trainee doctor emigration from Ireland. Methods Using a partially mixed sequential dominant (quantitative) study design, a nationally representative sample of 893 trainee doctors was invited to complete an online survey. Of the 523 who responded (58. 6 % response rate), 423 were still in Ireland and responded to questions on factors influencing intention to practice medicine abroad and are the subjects of this study. Explanatory factors for intention to practice medicine in Ireland in the foreseeable future, the primary outcome, included demographic variables and experiences of working within the Irish health system. Associations were examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for factors influencing the primary outcome. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 50  trainee doctors and analysed thematically, exploring issues associated with intention to practice medicine abroad. Results There were high levels of dissatisfaction among trainee doctors around working conditions, training and career progression opportunities in Ireland. However, most factors did not discriminate between intention to leave or stay. Factors that did predict intention to leave included dissatisfaction with one’s work-life balance (odds ratio (OR) 2. 51; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 53 – 4. 10; P[*]<[*] 0. 001); feeling that the quality of training in Ireland was poor (OR 1. 82; 95 % CI 1. 09 – 3. 05; P[*]=[*] 0. 002) and <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>family</b> or personal <b>reasons</b> (OR 1. 85; 95 % CI 1. 08 – 3. 17; P[*]=[*] 0. 027).

40|$|Cluster Analysis of Family-Related Benefits Policies across U. S. Academic Institutions Although the {{under-representation}} {{of women}} {{in science and engineering}} tenure-track faculty positions is often linked to the conflict between childcare responsibilities and the normative academic tenure-track pathway, previous studies have tended to focus on individual life choices,rather than the effects of institutional-level policies and structure. More recent research on work/life policies in higher education have pushed our understanding of how organizational structure and political climates at the department and institution levels influence the ability of faculty members to integrate career and life responsibilities. Many post-secondary institutions offer more generous work/life benefits than required by the 1993 Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides employees with 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>family</b> and medical <b>reasons</b> per year if the employee has worked for the employer at least 12 months. The types of family-related benefits offered, however, vary greatly across post-secondary institutions in the United States. Using cluster analysis, this study identifies the patterns of availability of parental leave and childcare benefits across U. S. academic institutions by grouping institutions into clusters of similar institutions. By so doing, the paper highlights the rates at which different types of institutions adopted family-friendly policies since the FMLA. Cluster analysis is a technique for grouping a collection of cases, such as institutions, by a number of attributes or variables. It is used across many fields including education, engineering,life, social, and physical sciences as an exploratory or data mining technique. This study applies a k-means cluster analysis, a well established technique previously used in engineering education research, to identify patterns in types of benefits policies offered by institutional characteristics or profiles. The characteristics examined include student demographics and enrollment size,faculty size, research expenditures, and instructional expenditures. The data come from the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) Institution survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics with response rates exceeding 86 %. The nationally representative 1993 and 2004 samples include 974 and 1, 080 public and private not-for-profit institutions that confer associates, bachelors, or advanced degrees, respectively. Preliminary results with six clusters indicate that doctoral research institutions with the highest average instructional and research expenditures are more likely to offer a greater number of family-related benefits to both part-time and full-time faculty compared to associates, bachelors or masters institutions. These doctoral institutions also have the largest average student enrollment and a relatively more diverse student population. Ongoing work includes identifying the rates of adoption of benefits policies following the FMLA. By analyzing both 1993 and 2004,changes in the overall profiles of institutions with different policy arrangements may also be revealed. Research findings will provide a national perspective of academic institutions’ efforts to facilitate work-life integration among faculty to help administrators, policy makers, and other stakeholders shape educational policy...|$|R
2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> <b>family</b> and medical <b>reasons.</b> The <b>Family</b> and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws <b>for</b> paid <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of <b>leave</b> <b>for</b> [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|R
