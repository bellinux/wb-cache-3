50|$|Twisted Pair (TP) {{conductor}} (sometimes {{called by}} the trade-names T-2 or VR) has the two sub-conductors twisted (usually with a left-hand lay) about one another generally with a <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> of approximately three meters (nine feet).|$|E
50|$|In {{communications}} cables, transposition is used {{to reduce}} coupling between circuits in the same cable. The principal measure is the pitch or <b>lay</b> <b>length,</b> the distance over which the pairs of a circuit are twisted. By twisting, the wires become longer than the cable. The stranding factor indicates the relationship of single wire length to cable length; it amounts to with communication cables about 1.02 to 1.04.|$|E
50|$|In the {{so-called}} cross lay strands, the wires {{of the different}} layers cross each other. In the mostly used parallel lay strands, the <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> of all the wire layers is equal and the wires of any two superimposed layers are parallel, resulting in linear contact. The wire of the outer layer is supported by two wires of the inner layer. These wires are neighbours along the whole length of the strand. Parallel lay strands are made in one operation. The endurance of wire ropes {{with this kind of}} strand is always much greater than of those (seldom used) with cross lay strands. Parallel lay strands with two wire layers have the construction Filler, Seale or Warrington.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{the most}} of the {{available}} cable clamps are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single cable clamps can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the <b>laying</b> <b>length</b> of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters.|$|R

40|$|Wire ropes {{are exposed}} to huge {{external}} powers everyday. Therefore strict rules for a regular visual inspection exist. Many approaches for textural defect detection in textiles or other materials exist. However, until today no real possibility to control rope attributes like <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> or diameter over the whole rope curse exist. To meet this drawback we present an automatic inspection approach based on a geometric rope model. The parameters of the rope model are estimated over time given raw 2 -d image data and local surface defects are located by comparison of the real data with a 2 -d projection of the ideal model...|$|E

40|$|A {{new series}} of double shear tests were carried out using a newly {{modified}} double shear apparatus which prevented contacts between concrete block surfaces during shearing. 13 double shear tests were carried out using 21 mm diameter 19 (9 x 9 x 1) seal construction wire strand cable (also called Superstrand cable), Plain SUMO, Indented SUMO, Spiral MW 9 and Plain MW 10 cable bolts. These cables were tested subjected to different pretension loads. Concrete blocks with Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of 40 MPa and Stratabinder grout were used for all the tests to maintain test consistency. The {{results show that the}} peak shear load and the corresponding shear displacement decrease by increasing the pretension load of the tested cable. The Ultimate tensile strength, <b>lay</b> <b>length,</b> number of wires and cable bolt surface profile type (plain and spiral/indented) are important factors in total shear strength of the cable bolt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A regular rope quality {{inspection}} is compulsory for wire ropes in security-relevant applications. Principal procedures of such qual-ity checks are the visual inspection for surface defect detection, the mag-netic inspection for a localization of broken wires and {{the measurement of}} the rope diameter. However, until today it is hardly possible for the human inspector to measure other important rope characteristics as the <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> of wires and strands over time. To close this gap, we present a model-based approach for rope parameter estimation. The usage of a theoretically correct and regular 3 d rope, embedded in an analysis-by synthesis framework, allows a purely image-based monitoring of impor-tant rope parameters. Beyond that, also a quantification {{of the degree of}} abnormality becomes possible. Our evaluation on real-world and syn-thetic reference data demonstrates that the approach allows a measure-ment of the individual lay lengths of wires and strands up to an accuracy more precise than 1 mm. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{strength}} properties of Secura Hollow Groutable Cable-bolts (HGC) were examined for tensile and shear failures. The 30 mm diameter, nine strand, cable bolt {{consisted of a}} mixture of five 7. 5 mm plain and four 7. 0 mm indented strands wrapped around a central 14 mm steel grouting hole to make a round cable with <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> of 500 mm with bulbs at 500 mm centres of diameter 35 mm. The tensile strength of the cable was tested {{in accordance with the}} British Standard (BS 7861 -part 2 : 2009) using the double embedment pull test. The shear strength of the cable bolt was tested by both the BS 7861 single and UOW double shear methods. The single shear double test used a guillotine shear frame of double embodiment tendon/grout assembly in a steel tube, while the double shear method enabled shear testing of the cable bolt in concrete to simulate rock. It was found that the tensile strength of the cable was in the order of 680 kN, the shear load by single shear test, based on the average of three tests, was around 448 kN. The shear failure load of the cable bolt from double shear testing base...|$|E

The shear failure load of the cable bolt from double shear testing based on two tests averaged around 786 kN which is significantly higher than achieved from the single shear test. Thus the shear value, obtained from the double shear method was between 13 and 18 % greater than the single shear test method. The use of the guillotine shear frame for the single shear method was considered an unrealistic method of evaluating the shear characteristics of the cable bolts in rock...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of helically-stranded conductors (aluminium and aluminium alloy), {{intended for use}} in distribution and transmission lines, depends on the conductor cross-section area, the conductivity of the aluminium alloy, the <b>lay</b> <b>length</b> of the aluminium layers, and {{the presence or absence}} of a steel reinforcing core. The presence of a stranded steel core both reduces the conductor resistance due to the conductivity of the galvanized steel wires and increases the resistance due to core magnetizing effects. This brochure describes a process of calculation for stranded aluminium conductors both with and without a steel reinforcing core. APPENDIX A provides a MathCad programme to determine the AC resistance of a stranded conductor for a given current. This output can be used in conjunction with the steady state model to determine the actual current flow or conductor temperature. APPENDIX B provides an alternate model for the calculation of the AC resistance On the basis of laboratory tests and theoretical studies, it has been determined, that AC resistance of stranded aluminium conductors (AAC) or all aluminium conductors (AAAC) can be calculated with acceptable accuracy by taking into consideration the conductor geometry, e. g. lay ratio, diameter of wire, current and temperature distribution of conductor. Resistance calculations with Aluminium conductor Steel reinforced (ACSR), however, can be more complex due interactions between the currents in each helically stranded layer coupled through the steel core. On the basis of results from research [5, 6, 7, 8]* computer programs have been developed that can determine the AC resistance of ACSR very accurately (one presented here). This brochure describes the theory as well as demonstrating a programme that can be used within existing software packages that will enable rapid and accurate determination of AC resistance for helically stranded conductor types...|$|E

40|$|A {{deterministic}} model is developed {{to support the}} tactical and operational replacement decisions at broiler breeder farms. The marginal net revenue approach is applied to determine the optimal replacement age of a flock. The objective function of the model maximizes the annual gross margin over the flock’s production cycle. To calculate the gross margin, future egg production, fertility, or hatchability of the eggs, revenues and variable costs of a flock were estimated. For tactical decisions, the optimal <b>laying</b> <b>length</b> is {{the age at which}} the average gross margin of an average flock is maximal. For operational decisions, a flock should be replaced when the marginal gross margin of a replaceable flock is less than the average gross margin of an average flock. To demonstrate the model, a broiler breeder flock from a Dutch breeder farm was used. A sensitivity analysis showed that the optimal replacement decision, for both tactical and operational management, is sensitive to the decrease in the weekly egg production after the peak and the prices of feed and hatching eggs. The effect of the decrease in weekly fertility after the peak on the replacement decision is related to the payment system for hatching eggs.
