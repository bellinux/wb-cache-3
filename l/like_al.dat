He recorded the manner in which he conducted his experiments in precise detail so that others could reproduce and independently test his results - a cornerstone of the scientific method, and a continuation of the work of researchers <b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Battani.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz defines Islamism as {{a desire}} to impose any given {{interpretation}} of Islam over society. He notes that Islamism, like Communism before it, comes in different shades: organisations like the Muslim Brotherhood {{who want to work}} within democratic set up to further their agenda; groups like Hizb ut Tahrir which are revolutionary in nature and seek power through military coups; militant groups <b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Qaeda and ISIS who engage in direct violence. He also differentiates Islamism from conservative Islam, with the former having political ambitions.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, some 245 {{newspapers}} and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents. The Tunisian political parties {{have the right to}} publish their own newspapers, but those of the opposition parties have very limited editions (<b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Mawkif or Mouwatinoun). Before the recent democratic transition, although freedom of the press was formally guaranteed by the constitution, almost all newspapers have in practice followed the government line report. Critical approach to the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (then in power) were suppressed. In essence, the media was dominated by state authorities through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse. This has changed since, as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished, and self-censorship has significantly decreased. Nonetheless, the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear.|$|E

25|$|In a damage {{assessment}} {{carried by the}} CMWU, four water wells in Beit Hanoun, Gaza City, and Jabalia have been totally destroyed. Damage to several water carriers are widely reported. Preliminary findings shows that some Gaza areas <b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Atatra and Izbet Abd Raboo sustained 50 percent of their water networks damaged, while others have sustained a 30 to 35 percent damage to their networks. In total, 5,708 roof-top tanks were completely destroyed, and 2,985 were damaged. 2,204 solar heaters were destroyed and 1,762 were damaged. In some areas, the price of tankered water {{is as high as}} 175 Israeli new sheqel per metre cube. Several humanitarian organizations including Action Against Hunger, CARE, ICRC, Oxfam, and Unicef continue to provide drinking water to people in need, and also material and financial support to the CMWU for emergency repairs. Oxfam and Action Against Hunger report a short supply of water tanks for distributing water, which makes {{it difficult for them to}} cover all areas in need. The CMWU has created a list of prioritized elements items including pipes, generators, and pumps awaiting clearance by the Israeli authorities for entry into Gaza. The International Red Cross requested approval from the Israeli authorities for the entry of 36 trucks containing such repair material, but only 13 trucks were allowed. The PVC pipes that the Red Cross previously cleared were refused entry by the Israeli authorities. On 9 February, the UN states that the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza remains problematic, and as a consequence major repairs to Gaza's water network can not take place.|$|E

He stated first and second that [...] "American intervention would diminish Iran's influence in the Arab world" [...] and that [...] "a more muscular American policy could keep the conflict from spreading" [...] with [...] "sectarian strife in Lebanon and Iraq". Third, Boot argued that [...] "training and equipping reliable partners within Syria's internal opposition" [...] could help [...] "create a bulwark against extremist groups <b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Qaeda".

500|$|In 1992, Biondo {{played a}} tape of Cassidy's voice for Chuck Brown, the [...] "Godfather of go-go".

The album was released and distributed in 1992 by Liaison Records, the label that also released Brown's Go-go albums. Brown originally intended to record an additional duet with Cassidy for his next solo album, but this was postponed due to ongoing negotiations between Dale and other labels for a solo deal. Cassidy's unwillingness to narrow her stylistic focus to one genre hindered her chances of securing a deal. After talks broke down, the two decided to record their own duet album. As a duo, they performed at the Columbia Arts Festival and opened for acts <b>like</b> <b>Al</b> Green and The Neville Brothers.|$|E

2500|$|These mercantile {{relations}} {{might have}} intensified from the 9th century onwards, when several gold and emerald mines {{were discovered in}} the east Sudanese desert. It is in that time that the Arab historian al-Yaqubi would describe Alodia for the first time. While short, he attests that 300 years after its first mention, Alodia was a large kingdom ("About two months journey"), with Soba as its capital. He also says that its power is above Makurias. After al-Yaqubi comes Ibn Hawqal, a traveller and historian of the later 10th century. He probably travelled through Alodia himself, therefore gathering his information firsthand. This allowed him to describe the kingdom in comparatively great detail, discussing its territorial extension, landscapes, economy, inhabitants and government. According to him, the current king was named Asabiyus (Probably the Arabic distortion of Eusebius), who inherited the throne from his uncle Astabanus (Stephanos) due to martilineal succession. Contemporary to Ibn Hawqal, there was also Ibn Sulaym al-Aswani, a Fatimid ambassador sent to Makuria, who would then travel to Alodia. While his original work had been lost, he was quoted by later historians <b>like</b> <b>al</b> Maqrizi. Like Hawqals report it is relatively detailed, focusing again on the geography, economy and habitants, while neglecting the political history. Interesting information which complement Hawqal are that Alodia was more extensive and powerful than Makuria, also having a larger army. It is also made clear that at his time, Soba was a prospering town with [...] "fine buildings, and extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens". After Al-Aswani there is a gap of several centuries. At least the names of two Alodian kings are preserved on Arabic letters discovered in Qasr Ibrim, dated to the 12th century: Basil and Paul.|$|E
