50|$|The first {{lead-acid}} {{gel battery}} {{was invented by}} Elektrotechnische Fabrik Sonneberg in 1934. The modern gel or VRLA battery was invented by Otto Jache of Sonnenschein in 1957. The first AGM cell was the Cyclon, patented by Gates Rubber Corporation in 1972 and now produced by Enersys.The cyclon is a spiral-wound cell with thin <b>lead</b> <b>foil</b> electrodes. A number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates. In the mid-1980s two UK companies, Chloride and Tungstone, simultaneously introduced 10 year life AGM batteries in capacities up to 400 Ah, stimulated by a British Telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges. In the same period, Gates acquired another UK company, Varley, specialising in aircraft and military batteries. Varley adapted the Cyclon <b>lead</b> <b>foil</b> technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high rate output. These gained approval {{for a variety of}} aircraft including the BAe 125 and 146 business jets, the Harrier and its derivative the AV8B, and some F16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal NiCd batteries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} past, Mott {{polarimetry}} has been employed only at low electron beam energies (100 keV). Shortly after J. Sromicki demonstrated the rst Mott scattering experiment on <b>lead</b> <b>foils</b> at 14 MeV (MAMI, 1994), a high energy Mott scattering polarimeter was developed at Thomas Je erson National Accelerator Facility (5 MeV, 1995). An instrumental precision of 0. 5 % was achieved due to dramatic improvement in eliminating the background signal {{by means of}} collimation, shielding, time of ight and coincidence methods. Measurements for gold targets between 0. 05 m and 5 m for electron energies between 2 and 8 MeV are presented. A model was developed to explain the depolarization e ects in the target foils due to double scattering. The instrumental helicity correlated asymmetries were measured to smaller than 0. 1 %...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper {{that the role of}} surface and near-surface plastic {{deformation}} is especially significant in both sliding and abrasive wear of lamellar composites. Lamellar structures were produced artificially from alternate layers of pure copper and pure tin or <b>lead</b> <b>foils.</b> The resulting composites were tested in three different wear tests: single-pass abrasion by a sharp, hard abrader; multiple-pass rubbing by a hard, rounded abrader; and pin-on-disk sliding. In each case the counterface was a hard alloy steel. Tests were run with the composite lamellae in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the sliding direction. It was found that the composites had much less wear resistance and greater abradability when oriented perpendicular to the rub direction. The mechanisms for wear particle removal and the role of plastic deformation in the process were studied by plasticity analysis and by microscopic (SEM and optical) observation...|$|R

50|$|In 1746, {{he showed}} that the {{capacity}} of the Leyden jar could be increased by coating it inside and out with <b>lead</b> <b>foil.</b> In the same, year he proposed that the two types of electricity - vitreous and resinous - posited by DuFay were actually a surplus (a positive charge) and a deficiency (a negative charge) of a single fluid which he called electrical ether, and that the quantity of electrical charge was conserved. He acknowledged that the same theory had been independently developed at the same time by Benjamin Franklin - the two men later became allies in both scientific and political matters.|$|E

Silicon strip technology is mature and robust, with an excellent heritage in space science and particle physics.

For carbon the experimental magnitude of the mean scattering is in satisfactory agreement with theory, but in aluminum and lead the experimental results are only 85 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the theoretical predictions...|$|R

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in August 1971 that lead tinsel caused an unnecessary risk to children, and convinced manufacturers and importers to voluntarily stop producing or importing lead tinsel after January 1, 1972.

50|$|Cupellation: {{the lead}} bullets {{are placed in}} porous {{crucibles}} (cupels) of bone ash or magnesium oxide and heated in air to about 1000 °C. This is usually carried out in a 'muffle' furnace, containing a refractory muffle (usually nitride-bonded silicon carbide) heated externally by silicon carbide heating elements. A flow of air through the muffle assists oxidation of the lead, and carries the fumes for safe collection outside the furnace unit. The lead melts and oxidises to lead oxide, which in turn melts and is drawn into the pores of the cupel by capillary attraction. The precious metals remain {{in the base of}} the cupel as a 'prill' which is sent for final analysis of precious metal content.In the bullion fire assay process, a sample from the article is wrapped in a <b>lead</b> <b>foil</b> with copper and silver. The wrapped sample, along with prepared control samples, heated at 1650 F (temperature varies with exact method) in a cupel made of compressed bone ash or magnesium oxide powder. Base metals oxidize and absorb into the cupel. The product of this cupellation (doré) is flattened and treated in nitric acid to remove silver. Precision weighing of metal content of samples and process controls (proofs) at each process stage is the basis of the extreme method precision. European assayers follow bullion traditions based in hallmarking regulations. Reputable North American bullion assayers conform closely to ASTM method E1335-04e1. Only bullion methods validated and traceable to accepted international standards obtain genuine accuracies of 1 part in 10,000.|$|E
