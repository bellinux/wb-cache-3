5|$|Just as Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{maternity}} leave ends and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) also returns, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is assigned {{with the task}} of forming a team and traveling down to Florida for three weeks to help Sabre launch a chain of retail stores. He and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) must select employees to accompany Dwight to Tallahassee. At first Dwight chooses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), Angela, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), but Andy refuses to let so many essential employees leave for three weeks. While letting Dwight have Darryl and Phyllis, Andy chooses Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to join the team instead, upsetting Dwight. Dwight then prematurely announces the picks and deliberately riles up the employees, hoping to change the team. Andy decides to <b>let</b> <b>people</b> convince him why they should go before making his final decision.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to <b>let</b> <b>people</b> decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only <b>let</b> <b>people</b> write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not <b>let</b> <b>people</b> in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Buanne {{approached}} several producers {{with the}} idea of recording a collection of romantic Italian songs with an orchestra, which was his real ambition, forged by 5 years of shaping and developing his ideas as an independent artist.

25|$|As the {{charterer}} {{was responsible}} for paying for the aircraft's entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, {{there was a great}} temptation to <b>let</b> <b>people,</b> who were not eligible to travel under the affinity group rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings.
