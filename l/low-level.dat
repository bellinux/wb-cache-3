5|$|The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{designed to}} excel at <b>low-level</b> penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the Cold War was {{the delivery of}} conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry, allowing for minimal drag during the critical <b>low-level</b> dash towards a well-prepared enemy, had been desired from the project's start. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative fly-by-wire system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during <b>low-level</b> flight and eased control of the aircraft.

50|$|More recent {{research}} has shown that there is a moderate trade-off between <b>low-levels</b> of inflation and unemployment. Work by George Akerlof, William Dickens, and George Perry, implies that if inflation is reduced from two to zero percent, unemployment will be permanently increased by 1.5 percent. This is because workers generally have a higher tolerance for real wage cuts than nominal ones. For example, a worker will more likely accept a wage increase of two percent when inflation is three percent, than a wage cut of one percent when the inflation rate is zero.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak <b>low-level</b> trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large <b>low-level</b> circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the <b>low-level</b> circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller <b>low-level</b> circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo San Lucas. In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 30. It almost immediately displayed signs of tropical cyclone formation with the development of deep convection and curved rainbands. Organization continued, and late on August 30 Dvorak classifications began on the system. On August 31, after passing well south of the Cape Verde islands, the system stopped its organization trend. Convection became sporadic, and the system became poorly organized as it moved westward at 20mph (32km). However, environmental conditions remained favorable. On September 1, the cloud pattern became better organized, and a <b>low-level</b> circulation quickly developed. Following an increase in convection and conformation of a <b>low-level</b> circulation by a buoy, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Six late on September 1 while located 1,600miles (2,590km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess whether concept-laden {{associative}} learning can occur under <b>low-levels</b> of awareness. Specifically, whether the repeated pairings of a brand with eco-friendly images or eco-unfriendly images would influence how people associate a brand {{with the concept of}} eco-friendliness or eco-unfriendliness. This study also investigated whether the associative learning that occurs under <b>low-levels</b> of awareness could explain how brand image is formed. During the learning phase, we paired affordable or expensive brand names with a series of environmentally friendly or environmentally unfriendly images. To reduce the possibility of contingency awareness, half of the affordable brands were paired with eco-friendly images, and another half was paired with eco-unfriendly images. We performed the same procedure with the expensive brands. For the test phase, an Implicit Association Task (IAT) was used {{to assess whether}} the participants learned the association during the learning phase and whether the transfer of meaning had occurred. Here, the participants were expected to categorise brands as affordable or expensive, and images as eco-friendly or eco-unfriendly. We hypothesised that if learning occurred, participants would be faster and more accurate in categorising congruent stimuli (the association during pair-recognition task and IAT were the same) rather than incongruent stimuli (the association during pair-recognition task and IAT were different). Contrary to our prediction, participants did not respond faster or more accurately when presented with congruent items compared to incongruent items, which suggested that participants failed to learn the association between the brands and the eco-concepts conveyed by the images. Follow-up studies are being planned to clarify these null results...|$|R
