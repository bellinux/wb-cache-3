The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E

25|$|Syncretism is a {{relatively}} common religious practice in Indonesia. The major religion of Balinese Hinduism and Javanese Islamic syncretism (kejawen) are examples of syncretism in Indonesia. In Indonesia, syncretism {{is characterized by a}} strong respect toward ancestors. Sasak followers of Wetu Telu believe after death the soul can still return to this world. Therefore, deceased ancestors can continue to exert a major influence upon the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> living descendants. This is why ancestral souls must be invited to ceremonies; if treated properly, they may aid the living and facilitate their undertakings.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} regions of the Maritimes, Miramichi culture is firmly {{grounded}} in the Mi'kmaq, Acadian, English, Scottish, and Irish traditions of the region's founding population, particularly in the fishing, sailing and lumbering industries. Every bend in the rivers, from Push and Be Damned Rapids to the Turnip Patch has a distinctive name. These roots and the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ancestors provided inspiration for the novels of local author David Adams Richards, the tales and folklore of Herb Curtis, and the fiction and non-fiction books of Chatham writer Raymond Fraser. Local young adult author Valerie Sherrard's first historical novel, Three Million Acres of Flame, deals with the 1825 Miramichi Fire, one of the largest recorded land fires in North American history.|$|E

25|$|In tiny villages {{where there}} was no {{permanent}} Nazi military presence, such as Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, Kępa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue, was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used the threat of violence against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety. Polish-born Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Natan Gross, in his 2001 book Who Are You, Mr. Grymek?, told of a village near Warsaw where a local Nazi collaborator was forced to flee when it became known he reported the location of a hidden Jew.|$|E

[...] All {{of the surrounding}} colonies protested the action, complaining that the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> citizens were placed in jeopardy by the raid. Since the Pequots had previously been relatively peaceful with the English, Endecott's raid had the effect Gardiner predicted and feared. Communities on the Connecticut River were attacked in April 1637, and Gardiner was virtually besieged in Saybrook by Pequot forces. Endecott had no further role in the war, which ended with {{the destruction of the}} Pequots as a tribe; their land was divided up by the colonies and their Indian allies in the 1638 Treaty of Hartford, and the surviving tribespeople were distributed among their neighbors.|$|E

500|$|The Autobiography is {{a spiritual}} {{conversion}} narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad and MalcolmX biographer Michael Eric Dyson agree that the narrative of the Autobiography resembles the Augustinian approach to confessional narrative. Augustine's Confessions and The Autobiography of MalcolmX both relate the early hedonistic <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered. Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the Icarus myth. Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest {{that part of the}} Autobiography's rhetorical power comes from [...] "the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write", thus destroying [...] "the illusion of the finished and unified personality".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the group {{received}} {{a large sum}} of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income. This capital was used to rent houses, initially in Denver and later in Dallas. Applewhite and Nettles had about 40followers then and lived {{in two or three}} houses: the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a [...] "craft", they regimented the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> disciples to the minute. Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted [...] "quality over quantity" [...] in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.|$|E
500|$|Evans also {{recorded}} a local folk belief {{applied to all}} of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread [...] "up to the last generation"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This [...] "countless stones" [...] motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E

500|$|The liberal {{political}} party Yabloko {{stated that the}} re-adoption of the Soviet anthem [...] "deepened the schism in [...] society". The Soviet anthem {{was supported by the}} Communist Party and by Putin himself. The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols. After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia's history. He also stated that, while Russia's march towards democracy would not be stopped, the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mothers and fathers bereft of meaning. It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem's lyrics; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
