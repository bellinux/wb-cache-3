5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive <b>Land</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Planning</b> Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E
40|$|Some {{would say}} that <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> are the dinosaurs of {{planning}} policy. And indeed, in almost every country in continental Europe <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> emerged as main instruments in the earliest/almost prehistoric periods of organic planning legislation. But unlike the dinosaurs, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> have managed to survive {{in most of these}} countries and they have adapted successfully until now as some kind of living fossils. That is why we prefer to see them as crocodiles. Like crocodiles, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> appear quite frightening because of their non contemporary unattractive look and their lethal/legal power. Unfortunately, similar to the gradual extinction of crocodiles because of climate change, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> seem to become endangered and mainly too because of drastic changes in contextual factors. Since their features seem rather unappealing at first sight, acolytes of crocodiles as well as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> rarely raise their voices in the debate about their survival. However, this contribution wants to change strategy. It consciously ignores the characteristics of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> that might make them vulnerable. Instead, it addresses three main contextual aspects of its questionable survival. In other words it focuses on the destructive ways in which planners, policy makers and citizens more and more position <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> as planning instruments. First, planners and policy makers seem to have almost blind faith in the power of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans.</b> The latter are still too often considered, by planners as well as policy makers, as the universal solution of each planning process. This dogmatic belief burdens <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> with impossible expectations since it ignores the original ambition of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans,</b> namely offering a framework for the assessment of building permits. It also neglects the role and position of other policy instruments in consolidating the outcomes of a planning process. Secondly, convinced of the robustness of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans,</b> {{in the last two decades}} policy makers in closely related policy domains such as for instance environmental, nature conservation and cultural heritage policy, have legally linked their own sectoral assessment tools to the approval process of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans.</b> Despite the integrating character of planning, this strategy has led primarily to a formal overload of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> with sectoral policy goals what makes them obese and vulnerable. Finally, the sensitivity of individual citizens for interference of government in their private property rights has grown tremendously, even when this interference is inspired by public interests. The combination of governmentâ€™s preference for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> as a tool to limit these rights on the one hand and the vulnerability of these plans because of the lethal amount of linked sectoral policies on the other hand, make <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> ideal subjects for judicial procedures. Already weakened because of the combination of the first two aspects, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> are easy preys. Before officially declaring <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> extinct, this contribution pleads for a drastic sanitation of the societal and political context in which <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> have to function. We want to prevent these crocodiles from extinction because, in our opinion, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> still have an optimistic and meaningful life expectancy. But as crocodiles have adapted to and need a specific climate, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> need to be strictly used for the purposes they were generated for originally...|$|R
50|$|From the {{perspective}} of the municipalities involved in the regional development, regional <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plan</b> is the guide and framework that has {{to be taken into account}} when the municipalities plan or change their local master plans or local detailed <b>plans.</b> Regional <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>plans</b> should also be noted by the authorities of whose decision making the plans affect.

5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape.

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>planning</b> and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
