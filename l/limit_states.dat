The two most common <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> used in soil nail wall design is strength limit and service <b>limit</b> <b>states.</b> The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the soil nail wall system. The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive wall deformation and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions. The two most common design approaches for soil nail walls are limit state design and service load design.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} in developing a <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function used in a probabilistic method when analyzing an aging structure. The so called dimensionless <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function was formulated from {{the application of the}} well known Buckingham π theorem coupled with the multivariate statistics. Its application was proven to be an easier solution for aging pipelines subjected to corrosions. Not only that, this method has the advantage to incorporate the circumferential defect (w) term, a parameter which is normally neglected by the existing codes and most <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions developed by literatures. For this, a review on the past and present <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function developments was first discussed. The inclusion of w term in the dimensionless <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function was found to be reasonable as it represented better estimation of the defect shape rather than its area (as seen) from the longitudinal view. Results from this new approach were compared with the literatures and codes. Its favorable results may overcome the conventionality of the existing codes and this is something to ponder.

40|$|Selecting {{and using}} an {{appropriate}} structural reliability method {{is critical for}} the success of structural reliability analysis and reliability-based design optimization. However, most of existing structural reliability methods are developed and designed for a single <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function and few methods can be used to simultaneously handle multiple <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions in a structural system when the failure probability of each <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function is of interest, for example, in a reliability-based design optimization loop. This article presents a new method for structural reliability analysis with multiple <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions using support vector machine technique. A sole support vector machine surrogate model for all <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions is constructed by a multi-input multi-output support vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, this multi-input multi-output support vector machine surrogate model for all <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions is only trained from one data set with one calculation process, instead of constructing a series of standard support vector machine models which has one output only. Combining the multi-input multi-output support vector machine surrogate model with direct Monte Carlo simulation, the failure probability of the structural system as well as the failure probability of each <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function corresponding to a failure mode in the structural system can be estimated. Two examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method...|$|R

In {{the first part}} of the thesis, the measurement process and overview of existing documentation is described. Due to inaccessibility and prohibition of structure modifying, at many parts of the structure the basis for drawing an architectural plan of existing situation were old plans and old instructions for building timber roofs. Afterwards, 3 D architectural model of roof structure was made. It was the basis for computational model, which was determined by taking Eurocode standards and manual for the design of building structures to Eurocode standards into account. Such as an architectural model, the computational models for every structure element, which carried out controls in <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> are also shown.

To {{reduce the}} {{computational}} {{burden of the}} reliability analysis of complex engineering application, approximate method is always used to construct the surrogate model of the implicit <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> function.

In this paper, these two methods are tested to several <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> functions including linear function, highly nonlinear function, high dimensional function, series system and parallel system. Least squares support vector machines are used to construct the surrogate models.
