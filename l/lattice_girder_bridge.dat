5|$|Stanmoor lock was {{constructed}} above the junction with the River Tone, but {{all traces of}} it have gone. Next to the pedestrian bridge at Stathe four living willow cones, which were woven in 1997 by Clare Wilks, have now rooted and sprouted. Oath lock no longer functions as a lock, but the sluice is used to regulate the river levels. Below Langport, the river is crossed by a <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge,</b> carrying the Taunton to Westbury railway line, which approaches the crossing on multi-arched viaducts. This {{is followed by the}} derelict remains of the Langport lock and sluice.|$|E

500|$|Northwich railway viaduct spans {{both the}} lock cut and the weir stream, and {{was built in}} the 1860s. It {{consists}} of 48 round arches, constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone, with iron spans over the channels. It is around [...] long, provides [...] of headroom over the navigation, and also crosses the River Dane. Hayhurst swing bridge carries the A5509 road over the navigation, and was manufactured by A Handyside and Co. Ltd., of Derby and London, in 1899. It is an asymmetric bowstring <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridge,</b> and its timber-framed weatherboarded control cabin is also listed. This and Town bridge, which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design, are believed to be the two earliest swing bridges in Britain to be powered by electricity. Both bridges were designed by J. A. Saner, who was the Navigation's engineer, and incorporate a sectional pontoon, which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge. Because of the risk of subsidence from the salt workings, the bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow the deck level to be maintained. Hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of £33.5 million. Winnington bridge, the next downstream, was built between 1908 and 1909, to replace the first bridge which was built in 1901. The original design was flawed, and hence the bridge was replaced after only 7 years. A pedestrian walkway was later fitted on the downstream side of the new bridge.|$|E

5000|$|The Great Central Railway, {{which opened}} on 15 March 1899, {{was the last}} main line to be built linking the north of England with London, and crossed Leicester on a Staffordshire blue brick viaduct, over {{a mile and a}} half long and {{comprising}} 97 brick arches and 16 fine <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> of differing designs and dimensions, spanning various thoroughfares, the River Soar and its associated canal. This complex and costly structure began to the north of the River Soar and included two impressive bowstring <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridges.</b> The first in Northgate Street was demolished in 1981 but the larger second, spanning Braunstone Gate, remained for a further 28 years. Known locally as the [...] "Bowstring Bridge", it contained steel <b>lattice</b> <b>girders</b> of 178 ft on the east side and 136 ft on the west, both reaching a maximum depth of 19 ft in their respective centres. The total weight of the bridge was in excess of 400 tons (407 tonnes). The bridge was described as [...] "unique" [...] from an engineering point of view as the main supports on either side were not parallel, meaning that the two supporting girders had to be of different lengths. The bridge was built by Henry Lovatt of Wolverhampton and was one of the last surviving girder structures from the Great Central's London Extension.|$|R
50|$|The third bridge, built 1863-1864, was an iron <b>girder</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>bridge</b> {{on stone}} piers. At the same time, a brick viaduct was {{constructed}} to span the flood plain {{to the south}} of the river. The bridge was freed of tolls in about 1870.|$|R

50|$|The Old Bridge {{went out}} of use in 1915 in favour of a <b>lattice</b> steel <b>girder</b> <b>bridge,</b> Downie's Bridge, built a short {{distance}} to the north to carry the A907 road. In 1999 the A907 was re-routed over the present concrete structure and the steel bridge, long neglected, was demolished in 2003. In January 2003, Clackmannanshire Council began restoring the Old Bridge and performed vegetation clearance, resurfacing and structural repairs to the masonry in accordance with conditions laid down by Historic Scotland. The project was completed in January 2005 and Tullibody Old Bridge now forms part of the National Cycle Network in Clackmannanshire.|$|R

5000|$|His {{response}} to a toast at a dinner after the cutting of the first sod on the Eden Railway gave his philosophy on the engineering of those lines:The works were all of a light and inexpensive character, and if he gave them a first-class railway, - one upon which any speed attainable by a locomotive engine could be run with perfect safety and ease - if he gave it without any extravagance, then he should only have done his duty, but if he failed then he should deserve all the obloquy and discredit attaching {{to the failure of}} light works. … Mr Whitwell had spoken of his character as a maker of cheap railways, but in giving a cheap Eden Valley railway he had relied entirely upon the easy district, and not on inferiority of the works. The line would be carried out in the most permanent and substantial manner possible. He made considerable use of <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> <b>bridges,</b> both with conventional masonry piers and with iron lattice piers; the most notable examples of the latter being on the Stainmore line: the Deepdale and Belah Viaducts. A contemporary treatise on iron bridges praised the detailed engineering of the Belah viaduct piers (and described the viaduct as one of the lightest and cheapest of the kind that had ever been erected.) ...|$|R

50|$|In July 2010, the {{westbound}} platform 2 {{was closed}} to begin refurbishment and extension work, {{in preparation for the}} new S Stock, to be introduced on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines from 2012, which will consist of 7 cars instead of the current 6-car configuration. Volker Rail has been contracted by TfL to demolish and rebuild both the east- and westbound platforms, starting with the westbound platform and then moving over to the eastbound. Reportedly it had been paid 7 million pounds to carry out the work laid out in the original plans. However the plans changed due to the poor conditions of the arches underneath the platforms, the poor condition of the <b>lattice</b> <b>girders</b> on the <b>bridge</b> over Bramley Road, and subsidence at ground level in the ticket hall.|$|R
50|$|The road {{starts in}} Ilfracombe {{as part of}} the town's High Street, and is mostly single carriageway. The road passes through the villages of Knowle and Braunton, before {{becoming}} dual carriageway standard at Ashford, which continues for the short distance to Barnstaple. From there it passes the town's railway station then merges with the A39 for a short while before splitting back off near Portmore Golf Park. The section from Barnstaple to the M5 near Tiverton has been designated the North Devon Link Road, and enables relatively fast access to the Atlantic Highway, relieving pressure on the northern section of the A39 and A358. This section is a modern, wide single carriageway trunk road (which was de-trunked in 2002), apart from the 5 mi stretch between Tiverton and the M5, which is dual carriageway. Tiverton Parkway railway station is situated close to the junction with the motorway in order to give easy rail connections for people driving from north Devon. Some sections of road are on the alignment of the Devon and Somerset Railway including the Castle Hill Viaduct over the River Bray, where the stone pillars formerly used to support a <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> railway <b>bridge</b> are now used to support the road.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. PC box <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> with {{open-work}} webs, {{mechanical behaviour}} {{of which is}} half way between those of traditional plain web and <b>lattice</b> box <b>girder,</b> {{is a kind of}} new bridge form. As webs are not continuous, vertical force cannot travel by shearing effect in a classic way all along the deck, so the hollow web box <b>girder</b> designed <b>bridge</b> behaves very differently compared to usual plain web box <b>girder</b> <b>bridges.</b> In this paper, mechanical behavior of webs of Abrea Bridge in France was analyzed by using Ansys tool. PC box <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> with open-work webs have many good features such as artistic and economic, etc. It can be studied and applied further in the world...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lattice</b> <b>girder</b> {{segments}} {{are composed}} of low alloy steel used for concrete reinforcement and intended for special applications where bending and welding are of importance. <b>Lattice</b> <b>girders</b> are essentially determined by the mechanical properties and the <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> geometry. This article is concerned with trends and practical application of the <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> production technology. After hot rolling, the wire undergoes a further processing in the cold state. Compared to the hot-rolled steel, the new cold-formed wire has a lower ratio between tensile strength and yield stress and a lower elongation at maximum load. Ageing of steel also increases yield stress and tensile strength and reduces ductility. To make sure that <b>lattice</b> <b>girders</b> provide all required properties the cold rolled wire has to be produced with {{a certain degree of}} over-quality in ductility properties...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} design was for <b>lattice</b> <b>girders</b> supported by brick piers resting on bedrock shown by trial borings to lie at no great depth under the river. At {{either end of}} the bridge the single rail track ran on top of the <b>bridge</b> <b>girder,</b> most of which therefore lay below the pier tops. In the centre section of the bridge (the “high girders”) the railway ran inside the <b>bridge</b> <b>girder,</b> which could then run above the pier tops to give the required clearance to allow passage of sailing ships upriver (e.g. to Perth). To accommodate thermal expansion there were few rigid connections between girders and piers.|$|R

40|$|Bridges {{are highly}} {{investment}} structures {{and an important}} landmarks in any country. Besides being vital links in transportation system, strength, safety and economy are the three key features {{that can not be}} neglected, before finalization of types of bridges, the responsibility of structural engineer is to take care of financial requirements and site conditions also. The paper deals with economy of steel plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> of conventional shape. To investigate an economy, it was proposed to innovate the shape of steel plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge.</b> Optimization of innovative shape of plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> is tested by selecting various parameters and compared with conventional plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge.</b> Comparative study is carried out by designing the conventional plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> with innovative shape of plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> by selecting different parameters.
