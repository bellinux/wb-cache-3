The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (<b>lubber</b> grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males.|$|E
25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A <b>lubber</b> line, {{which can be a}} marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
500|$|Diệm's government-controlled press {{overwhelmed}} Bảo Đại with endless personal propaganda attacks, {{with special}} editions of newspapers being devoted to polemical biographical {{accounts of the}} former emperor. This allowed Diệm's campaign to condemn Bảo Đại with much more salacious detail than was possible through mere slogans. This started in August when the daily newspaper Thoi Dai started a three-week series that disseminated unsubstantiated and scandalous details about Bảo Đại's life. These were written by editorialist Hong Van, who called Bảo Đại a [...] "dung beetle who sold his country for personal glory". Van claimed Bảo Đại was the illegitimate son of Emperor Khải Định, alleging Khải Định had been infertile and married a maid, before claiming the maid's son, by another man, as his own. The paper claimed Bảo Đại was [...] "big like a <b>lubber,</b> had many children, and was very fond of women" [...] while Khải Định was uncomfortable with females, hinting that the different personalities were inconsistent with a common biological lineage.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Lubbers</b> cabinet {{was formed}} by a {{coalition}} with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), with <b>Lubbers</b> taking office as Prime Minister on 4 November 1982.

For the 1989 election, <b>Lubbers,</b> once more as Lijsttrekker, won the same amount of seats as the previous election, and a coalition formation with the Labour Party (PvdA) was formed that resulted in the third <b>Lubbers</b> cabinet. On 29 January 1994, <b>Lubbers</b> announced his retirement from national politics and resigned as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal. <b>Lubbers</b> remained Prime Minister until the first Kok cabinet was installed on 22 August 1994.|$|R

2500|$|At sea, a ship's compass {{must also}} be {{corrected}} for errors, called deviation, caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is swung, that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the <b>lubber</b> line can be adjusted {{so that it is}} aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted {{on either side of the}} compass binnacle. The coefficient [...] representing the error in the <b>lubber</b> line, while [...] the ferromagnetic effects and [...] the non-ferromagnetic component.|$|E

50|$|After the 1982 general election, the new CDA leader, Ruud <b>Lubbers</b> (formerly of the KVP), {{formed a}} {{majority}} coalition with the VVD.

New allegations that came to OIOS' attention during the investigation, were also examined and indicate a pattern of sexual harassment by <b>Lubbers,</b> OIOS is also of the view that <b>Lubbers</b> abused his authority as High Commissioner by his intense, pervasive and intimidating attempts to influence the outcome of this Investigation.|$|R

25|$|In June 2004, Annan {{was given}} {{a copy of the}} Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on the {{complaint}} brought by four female workers against Ruud <b>Lubbers,</b> UN High Commissioner for Refugees for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation. The report also reviewed a long-serving staff member's allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter, Director of UNHCR Personnel. The investigation found <b>Lubbers</b> guilty of sexual harassment; no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official, or two subsequent complaints filed later that year. In the course of the official investigation, <b>Lubbers</b> wrote a letter which some considered was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges. On 15 July 2004, Annan cleared <b>Lubbers</b> of the accusations, saying they were not substantial enough legally. His decision held until November 2004. When the OIOS issued its annual report to the UN General Assembly, it stated that it had found <b>Lubbers</b> guilty of sexual harassment. These events were widely reported and weakened Annan's influence.|$|R
