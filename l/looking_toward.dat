5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. <b>Looking</b> <b>toward</b> the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E

5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> the planet. Its orientation {{is such that}} the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
5|$|The Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{ended the}} American Revolution and {{established}} the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River {{and within the}} first year after it was signed 50,000American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As it was difficult to return east across the mountains, the settlers began <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed the newcomers. A drought made rangeland scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.|$|E

Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E

She is frequently described as happy and <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> the future and describes herself this way. The mentions of melancholia and sadness are specific and related to particular events and illness. Richard Holmes, in his biography of Percy Shelley, argues that [...] "her agonizing and loveless suspension between the Godwin and Shelley households was clearly the root circumstance" [...] of her suicide. Locke argues that [...] "most probably because she could absorb no more of the miseries of Skinner Street, her father's inability to pay his debts or write his books, her mother's unending irritability and spitefulness", all of which she blamed on herself, she committed suicide.|$|E
500|$|In October 1904, Smith {{traveled}} to the Winyah Sanitarium in Asheville, North Carolina for treatment of his worsening cough, a result of advanced tuberculosis. George E. Smith died at the sanitarium on February 1, 1905. His death was attributed to [...] "shattering of his nerves", instead of tuberculosis, due to his habit of never showing emotion. Smith was interred in Union Dale Cemetery in Pittsburgh, {{a short distance from}} his childhood home in Allegheny. His funeral occurred on February 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people. He was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost $30,000 to build and was built to Smith's specifications seven years before his death. His mother later commissioned a statue in his likeness and placed it on top of the mausoleum. The statue depicts Smith, hatless and wearing a suit, <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> Pittsburgh while clutching a racing form.|$|E

2500|$|The sunlit sky is blue because air {{scatters}} short-wavelength light {{more than}} longer wavelengths.
