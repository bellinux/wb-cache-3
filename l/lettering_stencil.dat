50|$|Technical {{lettering}} is {{the process}} of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board <b>lettering</b> <b>stencil</b> style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.|$|E

50|$|Twentieth century {{developments}} {{include the}} parallel motion drawing board, and more complicated improvements {{on the basic}} T-square. The development of reliable technical drawing pens allowed for faster draughting and <b>stencilled</b> <b>lettering.</b> Letraset dry transfer lettering and half-tone sheets were popular from the 1970s until computers made those processes obsolete.|$|R
50|$|And Acme United {{continued}} on its acquisition path. In June 2012, it acquired certain assets of The C-Thru Ruler Company, a well-known supplier of drafting, measuring, <b>lettering</b> and <b>stencil</b> products. Acme United purchased the inventory, tooling, brands, and other intellectual property for approximately $1.47 million. In 2011, C-Thru’s revenues were about $2.5 million with gross profits reaching roughly $1 million. After Acme United acquired C-Thru Ruler Company in 2012, its products were {{integrated into the}} Westcott products family. So, the identity of C-Thru in many cases has become Westcott.|$|R
50|$|Allegro is {{inspired}} by the Didone style dating from around {{the start of the}} nineteenth century onwards, that emphasised alternation of very thick and very thin strokes. However, it emphasises this through breaks in the letter where thin strokes would normally be found, producing an effect similar to <b>stencilled</b> <b>lettering,</b> with a slight inclination suggesting handwriting and ball terminals and swashes suggesting music. Allegro is particularly used for decorative purposes, such as on book jackets.|$|R
50|$|Mosley {{helped to}} acquire for St. Bride a large range of {{printing}} materials, {{at a time}} when companies were disposing of their hot metal typesetting and foundry type equipment or going out of business altogether. This included material from Monotype, H. W. Caslon & Company, Figgins and the Chiswick Press, as well as materials from printing shops including the collections of Oxford University Press and the Victoria & Albert Museum, supplementing the personal collections of William Blades and Talbot Baines Reed which the library already owned. He has also advised on revivals of historic typefaces and lettering, for example one of traditional French metal <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The face is geometrically constructed, {{and based}} upon an earlier <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering</b> {{alphabet}} van der Leck {{designed in the}} early 1930s for use in branding and advertising Jo de Leeuw's prestigious Dutch department stores Metz & Co. The face shares structural similarities with Theo van Doesburg's 1919 geometric alphabet, and anticipates later typographic explorations of geometric reductionism of Wim Crouwel's 1967 New Alphabet and early digital faces like Zuzana Licko's faces Lo-Res and Emperor 8. The Architype van der Leck typeface {{is part of a}} collection of several revivals of early twentieth century typographic experimentation designed by Freda Sack and David Quay of The Foundry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} {{citation}} of [...] "File 13" [...] was in 1941. The phrase's origins may perhaps {{be traced to}} 13 being a supposedly unlucky number, although the exact source is unknown. Another explanation refers {{to the fact that}} there are 12 months in the year, and a file is typically kept for each, with the 13th file being non-existent (the garbage can). An explanation given in the NZ military is based on the use of <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering,</b> where a capital B (as used for 'bin') looks like a 13. Or the possibility that trash cans were 13 inches by 13 inches in size.|$|R
50|$|Stencils {{have also}} become popular for graffiti, since stencil art using spray-paint can be {{produced}} quickly and easily. These qualities are important for graffiti artists where graffiti is illegal or quasi-legal, depending on the city and stenciling surface. The extensive <b>lettering</b> possible with <b>stencils</b> makes it especially attractive to political artists. For example, the anarcho-punk band Crass used stencils of anti-war, anarchist, feminist and anti-consumerist messages in a long-term graffiti campaign around the London Underground system and on advertising billboards. There has been a semi-recent trend in making multi-layered stencils with different shades of grey for each layer creating a more detailed stenciled image. Also well known for their use of stencil art are Blek le Rat and Jef aerosol from France, British artist Banksy, New York artist John Fekner, world traveling artist Above, Shepard Fairey's OBEY, and Pirate & Acid from Hollywood, California.|$|R
40|$|Exterior {{aerospace}} topcoats {{are typically}} highly cross-linked polyurethane based paints {{designed to be}} resistant to UV degradation {{with a high level}} of adhesion required during all aspects of flight. These topcoats are also designed to be resistant and inert to a variety of aggressive solvents and airplane fluids. Consequently, during processing, a topcoat surface can be inert to the reception of the next topcoat layer. Proper surface preparation of each paint layer prior to the application of the next is critical for ensuring adequate adhesion. Historically, the only viable method to prevent de-bonding of cured paints has been to mechanically abrade (sand) prior to the application of subsequent coating layers. However, sanding is an economically hazardous process, adds process flow time, and produces contamination. In addition, sanding intricate <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering</b> in most cases is not feasible without tearing the stencil material and/or leaving visible scratches in the areas immediately surrounding the stencil markings. Chemical reactivation using a newly developed alkoxide-based chemical reactivator has proven to be a viable alternative to scuff sanding and has been successfully implemented on multiple aerospace platforms. This paper discusses the properties and application process of aerospace decorative livery, the mechanism and tests available for rain erosion durability and the performance of paint layers bonded by the chemical reactivation process...|$|R

Military stenciling flashes repeatedly in changing colors, fast dissolves, and swipes of various shapes, all against an unchanging black background. Following {{a montage of}} scratched footage from both World Wars showing the evolution of weaponry, accompanied by a voice-over call to arms by voice actor Paul Frees in an solemn, adamant voice, the Leith Stevens’ martial score begins with a crash and flaring horns as “The War of the Worlds” in brilliant Technicolor red military <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering</b> appears in a smash cut, rising in a second to fill the screen; then the lettering changes into green followed by a circular iris swipe that reveals yellow stenciling “Based on the novel by H.G. Wells”; another circular swipe reveals the cast names in green, which then flash yellow rapidly then back to green; a horizontal swipe from the left reveals in pastel blue stencil “Screenplay by Barré Lyndon”; followed by a swipe revealing rich dark blue lettering listing technical crew; another vertical swipe from the top with pulsating, flashing purple letters with more crew; another swipe from the top showing in flashing orange and yellow stenciling the composer and associate producer; another swipe with flashing red letters reveal the special effects artists; swipe again this time with flashing red and white letters “Produced by George Pal” right into “Directed by Byron Haskin.” ...|$|R

It was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine the impact a continuing education course on audio-visual materials had on the production and use of A-V materials. The students were health science specialists involved in teaching as a secondary job function. The course under review was offered by Central Michigan University in their external degree program as partial requirement for the Master of Arts in Education. The former students were surveyed using a follow-up instrument to determine the specific production techniques used, the extent to which the techniques were being applied, which factors influence the self-preparation of materials, and if the course's content was useful as a continuing education offering in the health sciences. The study was significant since continuing education short courses are important in maintaining the health science professional effectiveness. And, in an interdisciplinary age, it is also necessary to overcome lack of knowledge in related disciplines such as teaching. With few health professionals trained in teaching, the short course then becomes the main method of training in the related discipline of teaching. The data gathered indicated more than half of the health science professionals responding were involved in teaching, and all were using one or more of the techniques taught in the course to prepare materials for their teaching. The course experience encouraged the subjects to prepare their own instructional materials at home or in their personal office using techniques involving little or no equipment. The materials prepared included flip charts, hand made overhead transparencies using marker on acetate, and rubber cement mounted visuals with words added using the cardboard <b>stencil</b> <b>lettering.</b> The major deterrent to production of materials, and possibly to educational planning, is the lack of time to plan and prepare materials. The other factors acting as deterrents include lack of materials, lack of equipment, and lack of technical assistance to do the involved techniques. The study indicated that a course similar to the one presented is useful and could be offered to the health professional involved in teaching. To encourage both the preparation of materials and the effective planning, the health science teacher will need to be supported by being given time for these activities and by being given recognition for their media production just as they would for a publication. They must also be provided with the materials and other resources needed to plan and prepare their own teaching materials...|$|R
