There {{is a group}} of suffixes that signed Spanish uses in a way similar to that of signed English, e.g. signed symbols for -dor and -ción (for nouns). Articles and pronouns are fingerspelled. Signed Spanish (or Pidgin Signed Spanish) is often used by interpreters and during public reading or song-leading. Signed Spanish is also used by some hard of hearing and <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> people.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The vast {{majority}} of cochlear implant recipients realize significant improvement in speech perception. However, there {{continue to be a}} small group that does not realize such a benefit. In an effort to identify possible predictors for this, we have compared pre- and postimplant audiologic data using Hearing In Noise Test (HINT), City University of New York (CUNY), or Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) scores for 445 consecutive English-speaking adult patients followed for a minimum of 1 year postimplantation in two distinct groups, poor versus excellent performers. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: Poor performers were those who realized a worsening, no improvement, or an improvement of less than 10 %. This group numbered 58 (13 %). High performers consisted of a cadre of 194 (44 %) patients who scored between 91 and 100 % postimplantation. Demographic data relating to onset of deafness, education exposure, etiology, etc., were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the poor performers, 33 (57 %) were pre-/perilingually deafened. Of these, 79 % had not received any auditory/oral training in childhood. On the other hand, a total of 109 implant recipients were individuals who were pre-/perilingually deafened. Of these, 24 were in the excellent performer category. All were identified early and were recipients of a strong auditory/oral education. Of the high performers, 170 (88 %) were <b>deafened</b> <b>late.</b> Other findings such as preoperative electronystagmography with caloric testing, hearing aid use, device type, and high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone will be discussed for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high preimplant speech score, auditory verbal therapy, and postlingual deafness statistically correlate with higher postimplant speech scores 1 year after cochlear implantation. Device type, caloric response and hearing aid use preimplantation, age at surgery, and sex do not statistically correlate with either poor or excellent speech discrimination scores postcochlear implantation...|$|R
5000|$|The International Federation of Hard of Hearing People (IFHOH) was {{established}} in 1977 as an international, non-governmental organization, registered in Germany. IFHOH represents the interests of more than 300 million hard of hearing people worldwide. This includes <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults, cochlear implant users, and people who experience Tinnitus, Meniere’s disease, Hyperacusis and auditory processing disorders. IFHOH has over 40 national member organizations from most regions of the world. IFHOH and the European Federation of Hard of Hearing People (EFHOH) work to promote greater understanding of hearing loss issues and to improve access for hard of hearing people. IFHOH has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), affiliation with the World Health Organization, and membership in the IDA.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{new insights}} into the world of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults, a previously underrepresented, minoritized group that has experienced not only a loss of hearing, but in many cases, also a loss of self and cultural identity. Life experience narratives were collected from seven <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults who participated in in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews. Video-recordings of the interviews were transcribed in order to identify the major themes, or recurring patterns of meaning (ideas, thought, feelings) within each transcript, as well as patterns of meanings across narratives. Transcripts were analyzed using interpretive/hermeneutic phenomenology, based on the philosophies of Husserl and Heidegger. Fifteen emergent themes were abstracted and clustered together under four broader, super-ordinate themes or dimensions of the lived experience of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults. The dimensions included: transformation of self, social interaction, interaction with technology, and deaf advocacy. Although each <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adult’s lived experience of becoming deafened was unique because of their personal history, context and background, there were similarities in the descriptions of the experience. Themes from the narratives of participants were strengthened when they were confirmed in subsequent interviews, with differences within their experiences adding depth and breadth to the dimensions of the experience. The constituted meanings were then interpreted against the backdrops of wider socio-political and historical contexts that have shaped American Deaf Culture. The findings of this study provide a heuristic tool to restructure the understanding of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults, shifting from a strictly medicalized paradigm to a comprehensive model based on understanding the social world of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) This {{study examined}} the social and personal stresses experienced by profoundly deafened adults who lost their hearing {{after the age of}} twelve. The data were gathered from several sources including the <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> author's own experience, a discussion group, two growth groups, one case study and a questionnaire profiling 28 <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> subjects' experiences and attitudes. Very little empirical research has been done on the topic of late deafness. It was found in this study that <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> people experience a highly stressful upheaval when they 1 ose their hearing. Careers, personal relationships and emotional security absorb the major blows inflicted by deafness. In spite of the trauma, the individuals studied in this project (who were an average age of 40, deaf for 13 years) conveyed a hopeful message to newly deafened people: ???It's bad, it gets worse, but things will get better??? The subjects of this study overwhelmingly embraced total communication methods (sign language, speech and lipreading), socialize fairly well, indicated surprisingly good self-esteem, and were strongly self motivating and assertive. This study concluded with some recommendations to support personnel servicing deafened adults. The need to respect the unique situation imposed by adult deafness was stressed as well as the apparent need for more concentrated and appropriate dissemination of information to recently deafened people. Suggestions for continuing the education of late-deafened adults applaud the concept of mainstreaming which allows <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> people to remain in the hearing world they grew up with, functioning more equally with the help of support services provided by interpreters, note takers or tutors. Recommendations were also made for initiating a helping relationship, providing strong role models, dealing with confused negative self concept and leading groups of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> individuals...|$|E

40|$|Speech-to-text (STT) {{interpreting}} {{is a type}} of intralingual interpreting mostly used by <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> {{and hearing}} impaired persons who have a spoken language as their first language. In Finland, Sweden and Austria the speech-to-text transfer is performed in real-time by interpreters using a (specially adapted or standard) keyboard that is connected to a screen. As a result of different legislative frameworks governing services for the disabled, STT interpreting has developed differently in different countries and so far there has been little international cooperation. STT interpreting has also been largely ignored by Translation and Interpreting Studies. This paper examines the situation in Finland and Sweden, where STT interpreting training programmes have been available since the 1980 s, and Austria, where the first training programme started in 2010, and investigates the norms, values and expectations that guide STT interpreters’ practice in the three countries. It also looks at the factors necessary {{for the development of a}} distinct ‘STT interpreting culture’...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{identity}} is a construct {{from the literature}} on Minority Identity Development Theory. One 2 ̆ 7 s cultural identity provides one means of understanding one 2 ̆ 7 s psychological relationship to cultural communities with which one has ties. A new paradigm has been presented for understanding deafness as a cultural difference rather than a medical pathology. To draw out one implication of this new paradigm, a theory is presented for how audiologically deaf people develop culturally Deaf identities. ^ Four stages of cultural identity development are described. Culturally hearing refers to people who hold the dominant culture 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes and beliefs about deafness. Culturally marginal refers to people who experience shifting loyalties or profound confusion regarding {{their relationship to the}} Deaf and hearing worlds. Immersion identity refers to a radical or militant Deaf stance. Bicultural deaf people have integrated their Deaf pride in a balanced way into their full humanity. Different paths of development are outlined dependent on the circumstances surrounding the hearing loss. ^ An instrument, the Deaf Identity Development Scale (DIDS) is developed in both English and American Sign Language to measure Deaf cultural identity. The DIDS is administered to 161 subjects: 105 students from Gallaudet University and 56 members from an organization of <b>late</b> <b>deafened</b> adults. Support for the existence of the four distinct kinds of cultural {{identity is}} provided by acceptable reliability, interscale and item-to-scale correlations. Thirteen hypotheses pertaining to instrument construction and theory and test validity are tested. Test results are used to illuminate further the paths of deaf identity development. Suggestions for improvement in the DIDS are presented. ...|$|E
