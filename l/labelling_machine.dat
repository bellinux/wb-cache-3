40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{bubbling}} on wine bottle labels {{is due to}} absorption {{of water from the}} glue, with subsequent hygroscopic expansion. Contrary to popular belief, most of the glue's water must be lost to the atmosphere rather than to the paper. A simple lubrication model is developed for spreading glue piles in the pressure chamber of the <b>labelling</b> <b>machine.</b> This model predicts a maximum rate for application of labels. Buckling theory shows that the current arrangement of periodic glue strips can indeed accommodate paper expansion. Some recommendations follow on the paper, the glue, the labelling rate and the drying environment...|$|E

In this study the main areas of application of computer vision to the digital processing of medical images are reviewed. It begins with the selection of the three edges with more publications available in Springer, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and IEEE which are: segmentation of organs and lesions, feature extraction in optical images and <b>labelling</b> <b>machine</b> on x-ray images. Over them, latest algorithms, techniques and methods for medical imaging processing are analyzed exposing its main characteristics and ways of use...|$|E
40|$|This project {{explains}} how {{to implement a}} process management system in a firm. Businesses are not investing much on this discipline {{and as a consequence}} they cannot obtain its benefits: better decisions addressed towards improvement of efficiency and gaining customer satisfaction. Firms’ managers are not aware of their current process already functioning and so they are not able to detect errors or improvement areas. This is why Business Process Management and Business Process Improvement should be included as another management discipline. Five steps compose the proposed implementation phases: plan, analyse, improvement, acquire resources and implement. These steps are applied on a yogurt production firm called Granges Comas. During the first phase three objectives are set: serving customers more efficiently and quickly, reduce production time and lowering errors. To achieve these objectives the project focuses on the firm’s operational activities. The second phase is the longer one because it aims to analyse the operations performed within this organization: they need milk to produce yogurts, they need cows to have milk, and they need forage to feed the cows. To start with, agricultural activities are performed to get natural forage to feed their cows. They are provided with agricultural machinery assistance and, together with a full time employee, they perform the land tasks: plough the soil, spread cows manure and plough the soil again. Once the land is prepared they sow the seeds and after some months they can harvest and silage the fodder produced to feed their cows. The milking process is the next operational activity to be analysed, which aims to obtain supreme quality milk. Four employees are working on their different stables. They are in charge of: cleaning the milking parlour, lining the cows that will be milked, placing them in the correct position inside the complex, start to clean and moisturize the cow’s teats and after that fit the machine into the cow teats. Once the cows are milked, the equipment is removed, then the cow’s teats are cleaned and finally the cows are returned into the stable. With this process they obtain the milk, which is the main input to produce the yogurt. Their objective for the yogurt production process is to satisfy all possible customers by ensuring an ecological product with high quality and good taste. The process starts by filling a tank with the milked milk inside the production plant; they warm the milk and homogenize the mixture, after the 88 º degrees centigrade are reached the milk is pasteurized, after that the milk is lowered to 45 º degrees, which is the optimal temperature to throw the ferment. After 20 minutes the liquid yogurt is packed and placed into an incubator room during 5 hours. After that, the solid yogurt is placed into a refrigerator room where it is stored up to the moment it is sold to their customers. Having all the processes analysed, the third implementation phase consists on ameliorating the current processes according to the settled objective. The proposal is to acquire three machines: firstly, a packaging machine; secondly, a <b>labelling</b> <b>machine</b> and finally a packaging machine. This firm will be able to gain efficiency by reducing cycle time, errors and risk. Customers will be more satisfied by getting the product quickly and with a portable package. Moreover, a metrics proposal will also be set to track their performance and as a tool to continue with a non-stop improvement philosophy. The fourth phase consists of acquiring the material needed such as the three machines and a training programme in order to use them correctly in a coordinated way. Up to this point, the firm just needs to implement the proposal of a redesigned process and to keep on with a management system based on a continuous improvement...|$|E
