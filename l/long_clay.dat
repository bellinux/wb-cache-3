25|$|Clay's {{influence}} in Kentucky state politics {{was such that}} in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the Senate seat of John Breckinridge, who had resigned when appointed as US Attorney General. The legislature first chose John Adair to complete Breckinridge's term, {{but he had to}} resign over his alleged role in the Burr Conspiracy. On December 29, 1806, Clay was sworn in as senator, serving for slightly more than two months During his brief tenure, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. Though he did not remain in Washington <b>long,</b> <b>Clay</b> won numerous friends and established a reputation as a diligent worker and an entertaining public speaker.|$|E

50|$|The Legend of Mardoush, (افسانه ماردوش), {{is a long}} {{animated}} Persian trilogy {{based on}} the mythical stories of Shahnameh. The metaphor mardoush, literally meaning snake-shoulder, refers to Zahhak, as two snakes grew on his shoulders after they were kissed by Ahriman.The production of this movie started in 2002 and finished in 2005 {{and it is one}} of the <b>longest</b> <b>clay</b> animation projects done in Iran.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{quarrying}} businesses drew so {{many people}} from beyond Ebernhahn into the community, there was a necessary reaction to this in the community itself {{in the form of}} a developing transport trade. This gave rise to local passenger- and goods-moving businesses whose descendants can still be found today, <b>long</b> after <b>clay</b> quarrying ended.|$|R
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. <b>Long</b> <b>clays</b> are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|R
50|$|The {{second is}} the <b>long</b> spring <b>clay</b> season that starts in the Americas and Morocco before moving to {{mainland}} Europe and finishing with the French Open. It is usually played over two months between April and June, after the Miami Open. Unlike the other two clay seasons this swing does not share {{the majority of its}} time with simultaneous hard court tournaments.|$|R

60|$|The ex-policeman got up {{from the}} table, and taking a seat on the settle {{opposite}} the speaker, slowly filled a <b>long</b> <b>clay</b> and took a spill from the fireplace. His pipe lit, he turned to his niece, and slowly bade her go over the account of her loss once more.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} lying like this {{for half an hour}} or so, and had {{forgotten}} all about the ghost, when, on casually casting my eyes round the room, I noticed {{for the first time a}} singularly contented-looking phantom, sitting in the easy-chair by the fire, smoking the ghost of a <b>long</b> <b>clay</b> pipe.|$|E

25|$|Most Cucuteni-Trypillia pottery was hand coiled {{from local}} <b>clay.</b> <b>Long</b> coils of <b>clay</b> {{were placed in}} circles to form first the base and then {{the walls of the}} vessel. Once the desired shape and height of the {{finished}} product was built up the sides would then be smoothed to create a seamless surface. This technique was the earliest form of pottery shaping and the most common in the Neolithic; however, {{there is some evidence that}} they also used a primitive type of slow-turning potter's wheel, an innovation that did not become common in Europe until the Iron Age.|$|R

50|$|Johnston {{is called}} The Hub of the Ridge {{because it is}} located at the meeting place of the three river systems which flow away from the Ridge, a fertile plateau about 30 mi <b>long</b> between <b>clay</b> hills to the north and sand hills to the south. The area has been settled since the mid-1700s.

50|$|Alan Thornhill (born 1921) is a British {{artist and}} {{sculptor}} whose <b>long</b> association with <b>clay</b> developed from pottery into sculpture.

50|$|Iga ware's origins are {{believed}} to date to {{the second half of}} the 7th century and 8th century CE. The area has <b>long</b> produced a <b>clay</b> known for its high resistance to fire. In the early phase it did not differ from nearby Shigaraki ware.|$|R

60|$|The {{room was}} so silent--though {{there were more}} than twenty people in it--that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the window-shutters, {{accompanied}} by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of the man in the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of <b>long</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The miserable boy {{was only}} too glad to do so.

60|$|He shifted {{farther along}} the seat, and, taking up his <b>long</b> <b>clay</b> pipe from the table, struck a match and smoked the few whiffs which remained. Then {{he heard the}} {{traveller}} order a pint of ale with gin in it and a paper of tobacco. His dull eyes glistened, but he made a feeble attempt to express surprise when these luxuries were placed before him.|$|E
60|$|The class {{rolled out}} its carpet {{for the girls}} and opened its boxes of <b>long</b> <b>clay</b> pipes.

50|$|Clay {{trumpets}} can {{be found}} in South America, India, Western Europe and parts of Africa. South American varieties include imitations of conch-shell trumpets, such as the potuto of Peru. The Horniman Museum in London has a red-and-white-marbled clay Portuguese trumpet which was obviously copied from a brass instrument. Coiled clay trumpets probably derive from animal-horn or conch-shell models. Peru had <b>long</b> straight <b>clay</b> trumpets called pungacuqua or puuaqua which were up to 1.5 m long and were blown in pairs, as was the botuto from the Orinoco basin. Clay trumpets have also been found in Mayan cities in Central America.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} Clay Smith Cams {{can be traced}} back to the 1930s, when Kansas racing driver Pete Bertrand opened a car tuning shop at <b>Long</b> Beach. <b>Clay</b> Smith, just a boy at the time, was {{employed}} by Bertrand until the latter's death from pneumonia in 1942. Smith, himself a racing enthusiast, took over the company and continued producing precision engine parts, especially camshafts. In 1952, Smith teamed with Troy Ruttman to win the Indianopolis 500. Smith continued racing both cars and boats until 1954, when he was killed in an crash with Roger Ward at DuQuoin.|$|R
