40|$|The {{increase}} in the production and sale of food products stored in plastic containers, which serve different markets, caused the company researched departed in search of new concepts to increase the productivity of production equipment. With the increase of productivity, there is greater flexibility in planning and scheduling of production and exchange of tools. The implementation of the methodology of Single-Minute Exchange of Die – SMED reduces the setup time of equipment, maximizing the period of machine operation. With this the company more flexible production process and can reduce production batches, increasing operating rates, productivity and competitiveness of organizations. In this paper, we present the steps necessary {{for the implementation of}} the SMED in a <b>labeling</b> <b>machine</b> for plastic bottles. To this end, there were activities analysis, suggestions for improvements in machinery and procedures, timing of the steps before and after the improvements implemented and analyzes of the times obtained. After that, we obtained a significant reduction in setup time machine studied...|$|E

A reception unit (5) is provided for detection of {{the parts of the}} waves and generates reception signals transmitted to an evaluation unit in a wired or wireless manner, where the evaluation unit generates a signal based on the reception signal. The transmission and reception units are formed as an ultrasonic converter. The object and the substrate move relative to the transmission and reception units. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for detecting an object applied on a carrier substrate. USE - Used in a <b>labeling</b> <b>machine</b> (claimed) for detecting an object e. g. label. ADVANTAGE - The evaluation unit generates the signal based on the reference signal that is generated by the reception unit, thus enabling detection of the object in an exact manner. The accuracy of the detection is independent of the material characteristics of the carrier substrate and the object...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a two-dimensional variational {{model for the}} reconstruction of a smooth generic solid shape E, which may handle the self-occlusions {{and that can be}} considered as an improvement of the 2. 1 D sketch of Nitzberg and Mumford (Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Computer Vision, Osaka, 1990). We characterize from the topological viewpoint the apparent contour of E, namely, we characterize those planar graphs that are apparent contours of some shape E. This is the classical problem of recovering a three-dimensional layered shape from its apparent contour, which is of interest in theoretical computer vision. We make use of the so-called Huffman <b>labeling</b> (<b>Machine</b> Intelligence, vol. 6, Am. Elsevier, New York, 1971), see also the papers of Williams (Ph. D. Dissertation, 1994 and Int. J. Comput. Vis. 23 : 93 - 108, 1997) and the paper of Karpenko and Hughes (Preprint, 2006) for related results. Moreover, we show that if E and F are two shapes having the same apparent contour, then E and F differ by a global homeomorphism which is strictly increasing on each fiber along the direction of the eye of the observer. These two topological theorems allow to find the domain of the functional ℱ describing the model. Compactness, semicontinuity and relaxation properties of ℱ are then studied, as well as connections of our model with the problem of completion of hidden contour...|$|E
40|$|Active {{learning}} provides useful {{tools to}} reduce annotation costs without compromising classifier performance. However it traditionally views the supervisor {{simply as a}} <b>labeling</b> <b>machine.</b> Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e. g. “I {{think this is a}} forest, what do you think?”. If the learner is wrong, the supervisor provides an explanation e. g. “No, this is too open to be a forest”. With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label- but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories. 1...|$|E
