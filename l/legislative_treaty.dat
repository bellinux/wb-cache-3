40|$|A {{number of}} efforts {{to deal with the}} problem of {{shrinking}} global resources have succeeded in alerting the public to the consequences of a continuing laissez-faire attitude in the face of currently observable population and industrial trends, but little has been done to provide positive as well as realistic plans for countering the threats of such disasters. A systematic move in the direction of constructive global planning will have to be based on a new kind of model which includes reactions to uncertain contingencies as they arise. The present paper is intended to provide a methodological approach to the design of planning models appropriate for this purpose. The illustration presented here, in contrast to traditional approaches has the form of an interactive simulation model. In addition to trends, such as population, pollution, or per capita food supply, it also includes events. The latter are of two kinds: stochastic occurrences, such as technological breakthroughs, which represent uncertain contingencies; and deliberate interventive reactions to these contingencies, such as <b>legislative</b> acts, <b>treaties,</b> or R+D efforts. A full-fledged attempt to apply such precepts to global planning would require a very substantial effort. The present paper represents a first methodological step toward the implementation of such an endeavor...|$|R
40|$|Supranational {{executive}} power is mutating {{at the level}} of the EU political system through a growing array of institutions, (new) agencies and other actors who exercise in one way or another {{executive power}}s. One of the less visible though no less crucial executive powers is the management of access to official information. At the supranational level we have seen a growth in specific secrecy arrangements. An important way for building those secrecy arrangements is through the establishment of systems of classification of documents. These security rules have received little academic attention, both in terms of the legal framework and in terms of the empirical practice. This article aims to fill that gap in the existing literature by examining the intersection of internal institutional "security" rulemaking by the plural EU executive with <b>legislative</b> and <b>Treaty</b> requirements and in particular with parliamentary and public oversight mechanisms applied specifically to recent practice of negotiations on international agreements. Do the existing legal and political responses in the area of the negotiation of international agreements in particular indicate the existence of robust checks and balances by the EP to counteract the internal rulemaking power of the executive in the context of the EU? Is the EU executive "unbound" in a more general sense or adequately held in check by the EP in collaboration with other oversight institutions and the public...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{background}} of Japan's long-anticipated implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2007, this article analyses the <b>legislative</b> implications of <b>treaty</b> accession. One {{of the causes of}} the accession delay in Japan - nearly 10 years passed between the government's participation in the adoption of the Rome Statute and its implementation thereof - was the challenge of aligning the conflicting imperatives of domestic and international law. This article delineates these conflicting imperatives, reconstructing the deliberations over procedural and substantive law that attended the drafting of implementing legislation in Japan. We demonstrate in our analysis that unlike most other countries who joined the ICC community as States Parties, Japan had to overcome particularly formidable constitutional and legislative hurdles before membership in the permanent international court could become a possibility. Among other things, the implementation of the Rome Statute required a renegotiation, in key respects, of the fundamental principle upon which Japan's post-World War II foreign and domestic policy rested, namely the renunciation of war and the culture of antimilitarism that is enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the aim is}} to shed further {{light on}} issues of {{citizenship}} in the period between 1951 and 1971, often called the founding period of European integration. The contribution of the paper to the literature is two-fold. First, in theoretical terms it contributes by studying citizenship as a status of individuals in relation to a political unit differentiated analytically into four dimensions: Membership, identity, rights and participation. This amounts to a more dynamic approach than previous studies as it focuses on the interplay between dimensions rather than solely on rights or identity. Second, connecting these dimensions to the empirical, it contributes by highlighting those <b>treaties,</b> <b>legislative</b> measures and practices that are linked to the emergence, consolidation and/or change to the status of individuals within the system. The analysis finds that that we can fruitfully talk about a kind of citizenship in the first period of European integration. It must, however, not be overstated as anything resembling a full-blown citizenship status akin to national citizenship. European citizenship should rather be understood in its own right, as a citizenship gradually emerging from the founding treaties, judicial activism of the ECJ and free movement legislation...|$|R

The Cherokee proclaimed the tribe was [...] "a foreign State, not owing allegiance to the United States, nor to any state of this Union, nor to any prince, potentate or State, other than their own." [...] The primary issue of concern for the Cherokee {{in the early nineteenth century}} surrounded political and territorial sovereignty over tribal lands, not admission into United States citizenship. The only status of citizenry that the Cherokee valued was their own tribal membership separate from that of any state or nation that the geographical boundaries of the tribal territory aligned with. As the United States, and particularly the state of Georgia, wielded legal restrictions against social and political inclusion of the Cherokee, the Cherokee in turn ideologically conceptualized citizenship detached from standing lawful notions of citizenship.|$|R

40|$|Does the {{continuing}} assignment of legislative power to international {{institutions like the}} WTO, NAFTA, and the U. N. infringe the U. S. Constitution? The political controversy over the continued reliance on such organizations, and the potential effect on welfarist and democratic values, is increasingly perceived to have a legal dimension. Recent scholarship has taken two radically different views. One recent strain takes the position that such delegations are constitutionally problematic, chiefly {{in terms of the}} nondelegation doctrine and federalism, and proposes that the gap between these principles and constitutional practice be reduced. But others argue that these doctrines lack legal or normative salience. Delegations of legislative authority, it is argued, are functionally indistinguishable from any other kind of legislation; federalism, others maintain, offers no conceivable advantages over managed decentralization. The answer to the incongruity between the increasing use of international delegations and U. S. constitutional principles, in this latter view, is to conclude that nondelegation and federalism doctrines are underenforced for good reason, and to be done with them. This paper favors neither view, and advances a new perspective. After describing the range of international delegations that raise colorable constitutional issues, I first defend the proposition that, at least with respect to international commitments, the delegation of legislative authority is meaningfully distinct from normal exercises of <b>legislative</b> or <b>treaty</b> authority. But the reasons why delegation analysis remains conceptually relevant - including the difficulty any one nation has in controlling institutions with multiple principals, and the durability of international commitments - reveal that such delegations actually serve other constitutional values, particularly the value federalism places on the diffusion of authority and the creation of checks on the power of the national government. That is, if we look beyond the adverse effects international institutions may have on the existing agents of U. S. federalism, the states, we can see that delegations serve many of the same ends. After explaining this thesis at length, and reconciling the pursuit of diffusion with other welfarist and democratic concerns, the paper closes by focusing on kinds of international delegations that remain problematic. The objective is to move beyond the ascendant generalizations about the disadvantages of international delegations, without at the same time denying {{the continuing}} salience of constitutional values...|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} these groups {{consists}} of articles pertaining to international law and treaties. Article 90 states {{that it is the}} duty of government to promote the international rule of law. The Netherlands is home to several International Courts. Doctrine holds that this article also attributes the general right to conclude treaties. Article 91 states that the Kingdom shall not be bound by treaty without prior approval of the States General, except for those cases where law determines no such approval is necessary. Such approval may be tacit (Subarticle 2). Despite this, if not either a reservation of approval is made on conclusion of the treaty, or the treaty contains a ratification clause, treaties are according to international law binding upon conclusion. The article must thus be seen as imposing a duty upon government to arrange for such reservation or clause. Subarticle 3 determines that if a treaty conflicts with the Constitution, it has to be approved by a two-thirds majority of both Houses. Whether such conflict exists is decided by the States General; article 6 of the lower Rijkswet goedkeuring en bekendmaking verdragen determines that this decision has again to be made by special formal law. A special implementation by law of the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht determines that certain European Community decisions having force of treaty have to be approved by Parliament prior to even the conclusion itself. By <b>treaty</b> <b>legislative,</b> administrative and judicial powers may be conferred on organisations established under international law (Article 92). This has been done on many occasions, e.g. on the Benelux, the European Community, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and NATO.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{portrays the}} process of {{regulatory}} policy-making in the 'social dimension' as an ongoing attempt to resolve this regulatory conundrum. It begins by considering the context from which European level of social and labour market policy has begun to emerge: the actors, competing interests, institutions, pressures and counter-pressures which have simultaneously helped and hindered {{the construction of the}} limited regulatory regime that currently constitutes the 'social dimension'. It then proceeds to consider the emergence of an embryonic system of governance in this area in terms of the three essential characteristics of a regime identified in the work of Oran Young: the substantive (the cluster of rights and rules associated with the regime), theprocedural (the forms of decision-making) and the mode of implementation. 8 This will be carried out via an examination of the twin 'pillars' of the 'social dimension'. The first (the legislative pillar) which comprises substantive and procedural developments (involving EC <b>legislative</b> acts and <b>treaty</b> arrangements) will be discussed in section two. The second (the social dialogue pillar) which comprises a potentially important second instrument of governance - agreements between the so-called social partners - will be discussed in section three. Section four considers developments since the Maastricht summit of December 1991. The Treaty on European Union attempted, via its Social Protocol and Agreement, to create a new architecture of social and labour market policy-making by reforming the procedural and implementation components of the nascent regime: firstly by eliminating the single Member State veto {{on a wide range of}} policy areas; secondly by bridging the legislative and social dialogue pillars to allow for decision-making and implementation via 'collective agreement'; and thirdly, by enhancing the powers of the European Court of Justice to penalise Member State failure to implement directives...|$|R

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU) {{significantly}} {{changes the}} {{theory and practice of}} the delegation of executive powers to the European Commission, powers which resulted in 14, 522 legally binding implementing measures during the sixth legislature under the Barroso I Commission (2004 - 2009) (in comparison to only 454 <b>legislative</b> acts). The <b>Treaty</b> of Lisbon fundamentally alters the way this system works, and in turn the way everyone works with it, especially European and national public administrations. From obscure and informal beginnings in the field of purely technical agricultural markets in the 1960 s, the Lisbon Treaty has in fact made the so-called ‘comitology’ system (and the name) partially redundant. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, there are now two new legal bases; Delegated Acts (Article 290) and Implementing Acts (Article 291). This means that the ‘comitology’ world has been split into two. The new system makes a clear separation between tasks delegated to the Commission that only require pure implementation, Implementing Acts, and those that allow the Commission to amend, supplement or delete non-essential elements of the legislative act, Delegated Acts. The main changes in the Lisbon system are related to this new category of Delegated Acts, where committees cease to exist and the legislators have equal rights to object to individual Delegated Acts or even to revoke the delegation to the Commission altogether. Under this new situation the Parliament thus stands on an equal footing with the Council. The implications of these changes are considerable, in both practical and political terms, and therefore require serious attention from the EU institutions, Member States, and outside stakeholders. This short article attempts to address the key changes and questions. Based on the institutions’ Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and the new ‘Comitology’ Regulation 182 / 2011 /EU, which entered into force on 1 March 2011, we present the two new avenues and highlight all the important changes. We conclude with our considerations of the practical implications of the new Lisbon system for European and national public administrations...|$|R
40|$|The Kimberley Process is {{a treaty}} {{established}} in 2003 aimed at eliminating conflict diamonds, {{through the use}} of a scheme (Kimberley Process Certification Scheme) and <b>legislative</b> means. The <b>treaty</b> has been brought into question by many scholars, and rebuked for not being effective. Though many scholars believe that the Kimberley Process is ineffective, literature have not provided the structure of an International Organization as a proposal to improve their stand, in obtaining its objectives. This paper has constructed the hypothesis that the Kimberley Process is ineffective in obtaining its objectives, and poses the research question: “How would the Kimberley Process fare in obtaining its objective, if it were to operate as an International Organization?”. The research project utilizes the theories of Neo-realism and Rational Choice Institutionalism. The theories creates an objective view on International Organizations, and shapes both the importance of the current format and an alternative proposal of Kimberley Process’ structure. The research project attempts to answer the research question by using a deductive approach, as it works with a preset angle, taken from the hypothesis. It has been conducted through an interpretivist approach, where we seek to understand rather than simply explaining. The project investigates the core elements of the structure of the Kimberley Process. It draws upon the significance of how the current structure is hindering the treaty in obtaining its objectives. In addition, the analysis attempts to discover, how the Kimberley Process can benefit from enforcing the structure of an International Organization. If the Kimberley Process was to evolve into an International Organization, we believe that it would fare better in obtaining its objectives. Upon examinations of these components, it has become clear that evolving the Kimberley Process into an International Organization would require an independent hegemonic power. Each member of the Kimberley Process would be required to contribute economically in order to create and operate an independent administration. Consequently, vulnerable member states of the Kimberley Process might not have the capability to continue the cooperation, as this may affect their sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I offer a brief {{overview}} of the current <b>legislative,</b> regulatory and <b>treaty</b> frameworks impacting emergency management in British Columbia, with a particular emphasis on Crown-identified First Nation roles. I show that the regime overwhelmingly positions non-First Nation governments, contractors and other organizations to manage emergencies on behalf of First Nations. I explore emergency management as a manifold process that includes protracted planning, mitigation and recovery phases, which, unlike emergency response, are carried out with lower levels of urgency. I consider Canadian Constitution Act, 1982 (s. 35) Aboriginal rights in light of the lack of statutorily prescribed inclusion of First Nations in off-reserve emergency management, particularly at the planning, mitigation and recovery phases concluding that the jurisprudence to date (including the duty to consult and Aboriginal title) {{does not appear to have}} revolutionized the regime. While the constitutional status of Aboriginal rights should operate to insure adequate First Nation direction in each stage of emergency management, the regime continues to restrictively prioritize other constitutional priorities, such as division of powers and civil liberties. To better understand the omission, I theorize the lack of Crown implementation of s. 35 Aboriginal rights generally as an ‘obligation gap’, highlighting how an analysis of s. 35 Aboriginal rights as ‘negative rights’ fails to compel implementation of the full scope of Crown obligations implicit within the jurisprudence to date. I then offer a new framework for s. 35 as justiciable ‘recognition rights’ and juxtapose ‘recognition rights’ with the idea of justiciability of government inaction through a brief comparative analysis of socioeconomic rights in South Africa’s constitution and Canada’s constitutional Aboriginal rights. With a decided emphasis on the obligations of the Crown, this thesis attempts to offer fodder to First Nations and legal practitioners seeking to challenge the emergency management landscape where First Nations seek an enhanced role in protecting and restoring their respective territories in anticipation of, and in the wake of, disaster. For convenience and clarity, contemporary geographical and jurisdictional references to the areas now known as Canada and British Columbia are used throughout the thesis without intention to detract from the integrity of First Nation claims to their traditional and ancestral territories...|$|R
40|$|What are the {{connections}} between the United Nations and The Samuel Griffith Society? One is that Australian constitutional lawyers are now examining the relationship between international law and constitutional law. Justice Kirby of the High Court of Australia first argued for the relevance of international law in construing the federal constitutional requirement of 2 ̆ 2 just terms 2 ̆ 2 in compensation for compulsorily acquired property (s. 51 (xxxi)). In Newcrest Mining v. Commonwealth in 1997, he stated that in cases of ambiguity in the federal Constitution, 2 ̆ 2 international law is a legitimate and important influence {{on the development of}} the common law and constitutional law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal and fundamental rights 2 ̆ 2. The argument for the relevance of international law to constitutional interpretation was pressed in judgments by his Honour again in Kartinyeri v. Commonwealth in 1998, concerning interpretation of the power to legislate in relation to race (s. 51 (xv)), and again almost each year subsequently. The argument has generated controversy and has been viewed critically by other High Court Justices. Justices Gummow and Hayne in Kartinyeri, Justices Gleeson, McHugh and Gummow in AMS v. AIF in 1999, and Justice Callinan in Western Australia v. Ward in 2002, each stated that it is inappropriate to apply the principles of international law to constitutional interpretation. In Al-Kateb v. Godwin in 2004, Justice McHugh described the argument as 2 ̆ 2 heretical 2 ̆ 2. Controversy concerning the relevance of international law to constitutional law is erupting also in other constitutionally and democratically governed States. In the USA, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the federal Supreme Court aroused public criticism for her 2003 address to the American Constitutional Law Society, which advocated a similar deference to international law in constitutional interpretation. However, her argument has since been supported by at least two other Supreme Court justices in the USA. Back in Australia, in legal fields beyond constitutional law, such as human rights law, environmental law and commercial law, questions concerning the role of international law are evident. They range from questions concerning the predominance of the Executive in treaty-making, to the wide <b>legislative</b> powers that <b>treaties</b> vest in Parliament, to the latitude available to judges when employing international law in the application of legislation and common law...|$|R
40|$|Part I of this Article {{describes}} the economic models now proffered {{as the basis}} for defining rights in digital works, and explores their striking resemblance to the system of social ordering described and advanced in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Lochner-era decisions. The ghost of Lochner is not invoked lightly, nor with intent to belittle. Lochner represented a particular ideal of social ordering, premised on a seamless convergence of the private-law institutions of property and contract to provide a zone of legal insulation for market outcomes. In the physical world, that vision has long been compromised by evidence of market failures that all but the most die-hard Chicago school economist cannot help but acknowledge. The cybereconomists 2 ̆ 7 argument, in essence, is that cyberspace more closely approximates the conditions necessary for perfect markets, and that under these conditions, a legal regime based primarily or even exclusively on the private-law institutions of property and contract is appropriate. This argument, moreover, has found favor with government policymakers, who have used similar reasoning to frame <b>legislative</b> and <b>treaty</b> recommendations. It is both fair and important to ask whether en route to their conclusions, the cybereconomists have corrected the Lochner Court 2 ̆ 7 s methodological lapses, or simply reproduced them. Part II demonstrates that the cybereconomists 2 ̆ 7 debt to the social ideology of Lochner runs deep. Their proposals turn out to be grounded in identical beliefs about the conceptual primacy of private property and private ordering and the illegitimacy of 2 ̆ 2 redistributive, 2 ̆ 2 market-distorting legislation. As a result, their models are neither scientific (in the sense of describing an ineluctable reality) nor neutral, but rather normative and contingent on the very same institutions and arrangements whose absolute efficiency they seek to prove. Their failure to conceive of contract as anything less than voluntary and (definitionally) private, or of property as anything less than complete control, blinds them to the socially constructed nature of the existing mass market for creative works and prevents them from seriously considering whether a regime based on limited ownership rights might be more effective at promoting access and progress. The author argues that in light of the special nature of creative and informational works and of creative and intellectual progress, there is substantial reason to believe that a limited-ownership regime is better suited to furthering these goals. Part III begins the project of developing a stronger, more defensible economic model for digital intellectual property rights. As a tool for understanding information markets, the neoclassically-grounded economic theory to which the cybereconomists subscribe is fatally incomplete. In particular, critiques of the neoclassical paradigm supplied by institutional, welfare-theoretic, and political economists have identified several important factors that should inform efforts to determine the optimal system of rights in digital works. First, Part III explores the dynamics of bargaining power in the consumer mass market for creative and informational works and suggests that, in light of the predominantly reactive nature of consumers 2 ̆ 7 power to affect markets, consumers are more likely to attain relative equality of bargaining power in the legislative arena. Part III then considers the relationship between the legal regime governing rights in digital works and overall social welfare. It demonstrates that allowing content owners to internalize the uncompensated benefits generated by creative and informational works under a limited-entitlements regime would result in underproduction of works that produce significant social benefits. The resulting decrease in social welfare must be offset against any increased value that would be realized through market exchange. The question whether such a regime would be preferable to the current one cannot be answered except by reference to a normative conception of social welfare. Moreover, this choice implicates preferences about the conditions of individual and social self-definition that are not capable of expression and effectuation through the market. In light of these considerations, it would be entirely rational to conclude that a regime of limited entitlements is optimal. Finally, Part IV considers, and rejects, the cybereconomists 2 ̆ 7 implicit contention that the relatively 2 ̆ 2 frictionless 2 ̆ 2 nature of transactions in cyberspace is a technological imperative that dictates redefining digital property rights in the neoclassical mold. Technology and society constitute each other; if we have not yet developed an alternative technological paradigm for defining and administering rights in digital works, it is because we have not been asking the right questions. I conclude that both the legal regime governing rights in digital works and the technology for implementing it should be determined with reference to expressly chosen social priorities. Under a broader conception of economic theory and of social welfare, society may legitimately choose to retain and institutionalize a limited-entitlements regime for digital works...|$|R
40|$|This brief {{was filed}} {{in support of}} the {{petitioner}} in No. 16 - 405 (U. S., cert. granted Jan. 13, 2017). ] BNSF Railway Co. should win this case, but on statutory grounds alone. BNSF makes three arguments: 1) That Daimler AG v. Bauman forbids Montana’s exercise of general personal jurisdiction here; 2) That Congress has not sought to license the state’s exercise of jurisdiction; and 3) That such a license would be void under the Fourteenth Amendment. BNSF’s first two arguments are fully persuasive and decide the case. As a result, the Court should decline to reach the third argument. Not only is it unnecessary to decide, it has the further defect of being wrong. Respondents’ case hinges on whether Congress in 1910 affirmatively licensed state personal jurisdiction over railroads doing business within state lines. It did not. The 1910 Act specified which federal courts might hear certain actions under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. It did not say which state courts might do so—only *that* state courts might do so. Later discussions of doing-business jurisdiction in fact referred to a preexisting standard for state personal jurisdiction, established well before International Shoe. Respondents’ theory gets things backwards: Congress did not reshape state personal jurisdiction to fit the statutory rules for federal courts; rather, it shaped the statutory rules for federal courts to fit preexisting rules for state personal jurisdiction. While Congress in 1910 left state personal jurisdiction as it found it, this Court’s modern decisions have not. Respondents do not ask for Daimler to be overruled, nor do they deny that Daimler requires reversal {{in the absence of a}} statutory override. This is enough to end the case. That being so, the Court has no need to reach an important constitutional question. This Court has never squarely decided whether Congress may license the exercise of state personal jurisdiction that might otherwise be invalid. It should not do so in this case. “[N]ormally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case,” and here there are further reasons for reticence. The United States did not participate before the Montana courts, and limiting Congress’s power in this case may have the effect of striking down other federal statutes or may undermine ongoing <b>legislative</b> efforts and <b>treaty</b> negotiations. If the Court is going to restrict the power of Congress, it should wait for a case in which Congress has actually tried to use the power in question, and in which the United States has been available to defend it. The Court may be tempted to reach the issue regardless, simply because it seems easy—so easy, in fact, as to obviate any need for caution. Congress cannot license what the Constitution forbids, and the Constitution is widely thought to forbid particular types of personal jurisdiction. Yet that widespread belief is actually mistaken. When originally enacted, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments did not themselves impose any fixed limits on personal jurisdiction. They required only that a court *have* jurisdiction, over the subject matter as well as the parties—with the substantive doctrines of personal jurisdiction supplied by separate bodies of general and international law. The Fourteenth Amendment, in particular, was correctly understood by this Court in Pennoyer v. Neff to create a federal question of what had been merely a matter of general law, outside the scope of Article III appellate review. Modern doctrine is correct to hold that federal courts can review state judgments for their compliance with jurisdictional standards. But it is wrong to suggest that those standards are supplied by the Constitution itself, and so may not be altered by treaty or by Congress’s enumerated power under Article IV. To be clear: this brief does not suggest that the Court conduct its own inquiry as to the original law of due process, or even discuss the issue in any way. The necessary arguments were not briefed at the certiorari stage; they were not raised in the Montana courts; and they have been overlooked by decades of contrary decisions. Yet if the Court now finds itself in a deep hole of incorrect precedent, the least it can do is to stop digging. It should reverse and remand this judgment on statutory grounds, and it should wait for an appropriate case in which to consider the powers of Congress...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{response}} to David L. Sloss, Executing Foster v. Neilson: The Two-Step Approach to Analyzing Self-Executing Treaties, 53 Harv. Int 2 ̆ 7 l L L. J. 135 (2012). David Sloss’s article, Executing Foster v. Neilson, is an important contribution to the literature on the judicial enforcement of treaties. The author agrees with much of it, as he agrees with much of Professor Sloss’ other writing on treaties. In particular, the author agrees that the two-step approach to treaty enforcement that Professor Sloss proposes is generally the right approach, and he agrees that the “intent-based” approach to the self-execution issue that Professor Sloss criticizes is highly problematic. But he disagrees with Professor Sloss about the source of this problematic approach. The much-controverted question of treaty self-execution is widely understood to concern whether a treaty may be enforced directly by the courts or must instead await legislative implementation. Professor Sloss proposes a two-step analysis for addressing this question. The first step is to determine what the treaty obligates the United States to do. This is a question of treaty interpretation, to be answered through the application of the international law of treaty interpretation. The second step is to identify which domestic officials have the power and duty to enforce the obligation. This, Professor Sloss argues, is entirely a matter of U. S. domestic law, not a matter of treaty interpretation. Courts and commentators have fallen into error, and produced much confusion, by treating the second question as one of treaty interpretation, seeking an answer in the text of the treaty or in the parties’ intent. Professor Sloss notes that treaties seldom address the question of which domestic officials—legislative, executive, or judicial—are responsible for enforcing the treaty. Instead, treaty parties almost always leave that question to the domestic law of the states-parties. The author states that Professor Sloss is entirely correct to note that seeking {{the answer to this question}} in the treaty itself is highly problematic. Although there is nothing in international law that prevents states from addressing that question in the treaty itself, the fact is that states almost never do so. Domestic officials take their cues from domestic law, and states have very different constitutional rules concerning the need for <b>legislative</b> implementation of <b>treaties.</b> In the United Kingdom and most nations of the British Commonwealth, treaties are never enforceable in the courts until they have been implemented by legislation. The constitutional law of other countries permits the direct judicial enforcement of some treaties but not of others. In the United States, for example, treaties that require the criminalization of conduct or the appropriation of money must be legislatively implemented because the Constitution has been interpreted to require a statute for those purposes. Because of the diversity of domestic constitutional rules on the question, states rarely, if ever, address the issue of domestic implementation in the treaties they conclude. Seeking an answer to the self-executing question in the treaty itself is thus, in Justice Breyer’s words, like “hunting [for] the snark. ” No matter how hard they look, the courts will almost never find an answer there. States instead leave the question to the domestic law of each state-party. The most relevant provision of our Constitution is the Supremacy Clause, which provides that “all Treaties” of the United States are “the supreme Law of the Land,” and instructs judges to give them effect. This clause, the author argues, was intended to reverse the British rule, which we would otherwise have inherited. It establishes that treaties in the United States do not, as a constitutional matter, always require implementing legislation, and it appears to establish that treaties are judicially enforceable in the same circumstances as constitutional and statutory provisions of like content. The first task for a court confronted with a treaty should thus be to identify the treaty’s content, which, as Professor Sloss argues, is a matter of treaty interpretation. The next step should to be to ask whether the obligation imposed by the treaty is one that would be judicially enforceable if it were found in a statute. Thus, as with statutes, a treaty would not be judicially enforceable if it were unconstitutional—for example, if it purported to accomplish something for which the Constitution requires a statute, such as criminalization of conduct or appropriation of money. Similarly, a treaty would not be judicially enforceable if it imposed an obligation requiring the exercise of political judgment. This category would include treaties that set forth aspirations or that contemplate the exercise of discretion requiring political judgment. But, as Professor Sloss correctly argues, a treaty imposing a non-discretionary duty of government to behave in a determinate way towards individuals should not generally give rise to questions regarding its judicial enforceability at the behest of such individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the application of international law in municipal law, and more specifically to focus on international human rights law. A determination {{of the sources of}} international human rights law constitutes the point of departure. Treaties are the primary source of international human rights law, followed by customary law. Recent authority indicates that the formation of customary human rights law differs from that of customary international law in general. There are, however, also international documents on human rights not falling within the scope of the traditional sources as embodied in section 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Non-binding sources of law, or soft law - most notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - are shown {{to play an important role}} in the formation of both treaties and custom and directly influence state practice. Theoretical explanations expounding the application of international law in the domestic law of states are examined, assessing their suitability for effective implementation of international human rights instruments. Since the application of international law in municipal law depends on, and is regulated by rules of domestic law, the relevant rules of legal systems which may, due to historical factors or regional proximity, impact on South Africa, are examined. State practice points to two primary methods of dealing with international law obligations in domestic law, namely transformation (associated with the dualist theory) or direct application (associated with the monist theory). The specific method of incorporation adopted by a state is often closely related to that state's constitutional system. The advantages and disadvantages associated with each particular method are related to the intricacies of individual legal systems. From an internationalist perspective the often misunderstood doctrine of direct application, has the advantage of making the intended protection afforded by human rights treaties to individuals directly enforceable by domestic courts with a minimum of state intervention. The position of international law in South Africa is assessed against this background. South Africa's constitutional history under British rule followed British law requiring <b>legislative</b> transformation of <b>treaty</b> obligations, but permitting customary law to be directly incorporated into common law. The position of international law became constitutionally regulated in South Africa with the introduction of a constitutional democracy. Drafting errors and practical difficulties experienced with the 1993 Constitution, were largely ironed out by the 1996 Constitution. The post-apartheid Constitutions introduced changes and new dimensions compared to the pre- 1993 position of international law, including: the consideration of international law when interpreting the constitutionally protected human rights; the involvement of the legislature in the treaty-making process; and provisions for both transformation and direct application of treaties subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Customary international law is confirmed as forming part of South African law, and courts are obliged to interpret legislation in accordance with international law. An analysis of court decisions after 1993 reveals the following broad trends: (i) The impact of international law as part of South African law is still largely overlooked. (ii) The majority of references to international law by the courts are to international human rights agreements and decisions by international tribunals under section 39 of the Bill of Rights. (iii) The distinction between international law and comparable foreign case law, as directed by section 39, is often blurred. (iv) No distinction is made between international hard and soft law when deciding on human rights matters. (v) Courts have refrained from applying international human rights obligations which form part of South African law because they are self-executing or form part of customary international law. (vi) Binding international human rights obligations are only referred to for comparative purposes. (vii) The term "treaty" is interpreted in accordance with the definition of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The intention to create legally binding obligations is therefore implicit. It has been the policy of the post-apartheid South African government to ratify or accede to the major international human rights agreements as swiftly as possible. The execution of this policy has, however, met with numerous problems. As a result, South Africa has to date not become party to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. Many treaties to which South Africa is a party have not yet been incorporated into South African law and compulsory reports on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are overdue. Despite the post-apartheid euphoria about the creation of a human rights culture in South Africa and the formal commitment by government to give effect to international human rights instruments, much remains to be done before South Africa can be regarded as formally complying with international human rights standards.
