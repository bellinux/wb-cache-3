5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach is to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, {{proposed}} that the episode is a parody of organized religion, most specifically those who follow a religion, but only pay it lip service. The two argue that the principal joke in the episode is [...] "to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> religious faith has been so watered down and paid nothing but lip service, its rituals and doctrines reinterpreted so that only what's comfortable is adhered to." [...] This parody, however, is turned on its head: the followers paying lip service in [...] "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] are not stereotypical Christians, but rather, devil worshippers. Shearman and Pearson compare Mrs. Paddock—which the episode insinuates to be the devil incarnate—coming to Milford Haven, New Hampshire to judge his followers to St. Paul [...] "coming back and taking a pop at all fair weather Christians who only affirm their faith at their own convenience." ...|$|E

"Thriller" [...] {{serves as}} an autobiographical recap of the two years {{following}} From Under the Cork Trees release, referencing the band's mediocre CD reviews and breakout success, as well as thanking their [...] "diehard" [...] fans. The song discusses the band's Best New Artist Grammy loss, and Wentz calls it the [...] "most narcissistic song on the album". The line [...] "Fix me in forty-five" [...] is {{a reference to the}} length of a therapy session. On [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song [...] "kind of a tongue-in-cheek <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we are so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves – {{to the point where it}} just becomes oversaturated." [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer..." [...] has been described as [...] "about as close to a love song as you'll get from this band, a rare moment of tenderness among songs about blog entries, guest lists, and therapy sessions." [...] In a tribute to the politicized Chicago hardcore scene, Wentz describes the story of a rigged court case of African-American civil rights activist Fred Hampton, Jr. in [...] "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave". The song has been described as a [...] "very well-written track, a welcome respite from the one-liners which permeate the majority of the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s to early 1970s, {{the concept of}} {{combining}} the elements of multiple martial arts was popularized in the west by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that [...] "the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles." [...] In 2004, UFC President Dana White would call Lee the [...] "father of mixed martial arts" [...] stating: [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, {{and many of the}} things he wrote, he said the perfect style was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the rest away". A contemporary of Bruce Lee, Wing Chun practitioner Wong Shun Leung, gained prominence fighting in over 60-100 illegal beimo fights against other Chinese martial artist of various styles. In his career, Wong also fought and won against Western fighters and other combat styles such as his match against a Russian boxer named Giko, his televised fight against a fencer, and his well-documented fight against Taiwanese Kung-Fu master Wu Ming Jeet. Like Bruce Lee, Wong also combined boxing and kickboxing into his kung fu.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, I think if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a {{scriptwriter}} {{on the radio}} production of Burns & Allen. She appeared on nineteen episodes of the show that he had written between 1947 and 1951, {{and became one of}} his regular television players with the first two seasons of Burns & Allen, a two-episode guest appearance as Blanche Morton on The Bob Cummings Show in 1956-57, and then her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for The Beverly Hillbillies, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan would win the part; according to Henning, [...] "Bea took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Irene did the part and said to me, 'There's your Granny!'" [...] He additionally took Benaderet's suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny's rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962-63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts' Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt & Scruggs, who performed the show's opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled [...] "Pearl Pearl Pearl", and Benaderet was pictured with the duo on the single's cover. Benaderet described Pearl's curly hair as [...] "just my mental image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. She could read and write, and the curled hair seemed to Pearl the height of smartness." [...] Her performance as Pearl was well received; author Stephen Cox wrote in his 1993 book The Beverly Hillbillies: From the Small Screen to the Big Screen: [...] "When The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it started to become 'The Bea Benaderet Show.' Every scene that had Cousin Pearl in it was just about stolen by the actress." ...|$|E
