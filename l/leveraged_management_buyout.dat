40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} differing strategic uses of <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> at the corporate and enterprise levels of strategic decision making. The study comparatively investigated {{the use of}} <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> as divestitures at the corporate level, and as takeover defenses and investments at the enterprise level. These strategic uses were compared by industry membership, purchase prices, risk positions, and trends in these characteristics. In addition, the study tested the free cash flow theory of changes in corporate control as predicted in <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts.</b> ^ The research project tested the hypothesis that firms which implement <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> had higher free cash flows prior to the transaction than firms which did not change from public ownership. A paired sample was constructed on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, time frame, and size. There {{was no difference in}} liquidity proxies of free cash flow between the two groups of firms. The results show that debt and liquidity positions of the firms are similar and that <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> are more a function of the goals of the decision makers. ^ This study examined a total of seventy-five large <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> (purchase price over $ 75 million) in which all of the publicly owned shares were purchased and newly private firms were established. The strategic uses of these LBOs were classified by type: corporate divesture of a division or business unit, defense of the entire corporation against hostile takeover attempts by corporate raiders or another corporation, or purchase of the entire firm by management and other investors. The divestitures were analyzed with respect to the current movement toward restructuring corporations. The defenses and investment at the enterprise level were analyzed according to the market for corporate control and the concurrent market for undervalued corporate assets. These three types of LBOs were compared, and the results showed great similarity within industries, as well as with regard to measures such as ratios of price to sales and price to operating profits. ^ The research results demonstrate that {{there is little evidence that}} <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> are increasing the risks at the enterprise level of strategic decision making which employs these strategies. The <b>leveraged</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> peaked in 1984; managers are using LBOs more selectively and the use of LBOs is not increasing. ...|$|R

40|$|According to one commentator, a {{particularly}} troublesome form of insider trading abuse has {{developed in the}} past decade without full public discussion of its ethics or its legality. This abuse has spurred significant commentary. Corporate control transactions of this type, known as 2 ̆ 2 insider leveraged buyouts, 2 ̆ 2 <b>management</b> <b>buyouts,</b> and going private, have totaled billions of dollars. On their face, these deals, regardless of their specifics, raise the most basic questions of whether security holders are getting the legal and ethical protection they require and, by law, deserve. It is a fundamental precept of the theory of going private that different groups of security holders of the same class will be treated differently. Furthermore, the arm 2 ̆ 7 s-length bargaining that is present in the majority of intercorporate transactions is absent. Accordingly, going private transactions are often attended by uncertainty and legal risks. For these reasons, among others, substantive and administrative law are beginning to place limitations on the ability of corporations to engage in going private transactions. For example, under recent federal securities regulations, management must publicize its opinion as to the 2 ̆ 2 fairness 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 unfairness 2 ̆ 2 of certain going private transactions. Yet, there are those who question the effectiveness of these limitations. One commentator argues that persons who participate in a leveraged buyout have better knowledge of the true value of a parcel of real estate, an invention, a pending contract, or a competitor 2 ̆ 7 s problems than do the security holders to whom they make their leveraged buyout offer. 2 ̆ 2 This commentator concludes that those who initiate <b>leveraged</b> <b>buyout,</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyout,</b> and going private transactions are inevitably acting on inside information for profit. This Note first examines the historical development and modern application of judicial decisions and statutes concerning insider trading. This Note then discusses the phenomena of <b>leveraged</b> <b>buyout,</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyout,</b> and going private transactions with emphasis on their structure, fairness to security holders, and a possible breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders in the case of <b>management</b> <b>buyouts.</b> Following a discussion of recommendations and policy arguments proferred by other commentators and scholars, this Note recommends that a remedy be afforded to minority security holder who feel they are being grossly undercompensated, while allowing <b>leveraged</b> <b>buyout,</b> <b>management</b> <b>buyout,</b> and going private transactions to continue {{in such a way that}} the principle of fiduciary duty remains untarnished...|$|R

40|$|WP 15 / 1999; Using the Italian and European Union {{competition}} authorities databases {{over the}} 1991 - 1994 period, this paper analyses the ownership reallocation process in Italy, {{in terms of}} the characteristics of acquired firms and the effects of ownership changes. Our results show that acquired firms' financial and profitability characteristics in the years before the acquisition are, accordingly with previous literature, worse than the control sample, and that their performance deteriorates as long as the change in ownership approaches. As far as the effects of acquisitions are concerned, the impact is negative, even if not significantly, in the short-run as well as four years after the acquisition. A subsequent stratification of the sample allows a separate analysis for three groups of particular operations: privatised firms are only slightly worse than control sample before the acquisition and the performance improvement occurs mainly before and only slightly after the acquisition; independent firms acquired by foreign multinationals do not differ from the control sample before the acquisition, while their performance clearly worsen after the change in ownership; firms acquired through <b>leveraged</b> and <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> perform better than the control sample before the acquisition. These results are consistent with most industrial organization literature, except for firms acquired by foreign multinationals...|$|R
40|$|This article uses {{a sample}} of 120 {{unsuccessful}} <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> to test whether operational improvements following successful <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> {{are a result of}} organizational changes or private information. The findings are consistent with the organizational changes hypothesis. Firms with an unsuccessful <b>management</b> <b>buyout</b> had no increase in operating performance following the buyout attempt. In addition, the cumulative abnormal stock return from before the attempted buyout until two years after the attempt is insignificantly different from 0 percent. The author also finds that management turnover following an unsuccessful <b>management</b> <b>buyout</b> is significantly higher than normal. Copyright 1994 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

Drawing on the rent appropriation literature, we treat Chinese <b>management</b> <b>buyouts</b> as bargaining, clarification, and redistribution of organizational rent between entrepreneurs and the government agencies represented by local politicians. We further develop a model of entrepreneur–politician bargaining that identifies the determinants of varying rent bargaining and <b>management</b> <b>buyout</b> outcomes...|$|R
