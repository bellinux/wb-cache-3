2500|$|All laws {{relating}} {{to the use of}} medicine on the shabbath are a Toldah, or sub-category, of this order, as most medicines require pulverization at some point and thus undergo tochain. The laws of medicine use on the sabbath are complex; they are based around the kind of illness the patient is suffering from and the type of medication or procedure that is required. Generally, the more severe the illness (from a halachic perspective) the further into the list the patient's situation is classed. As a patient is classed as more ill there are fewer restrictions and greater leniencies available for treating the illness on the Sabbath.

5000|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} at defining science fiction.

Definitions of related terms such as [...] "science fantasy", [...] "speculative fiction", and [...] "fabulation" [...] are included where they are intended as definitions of aspects of science fiction or because they illuminate related definitions—see e.g. Robert Scholes's definitions of [...] "fabulation" [...] and [...] "structural fabulation" [...] below. Some definitions of sub-types of science fiction are included, too; for example see David Ketterer's definition of [...] "philosophically-oriented science fiction". In addition, some definitions are included that define, for example, a science fiction story, rather than science fiction itself, since these also illuminate an underlying definition of science fiction.|$|E
