Most dry suits can be equalised against squeeze via a manually operated valve fed from a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> supply.

25|$|During descent {{the air in}} {{the suit}} is {{compressed}} and unless more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become so tight that movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> supply.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "emission mix" [...] on {{the lamp}} filaments/cathodes is {{required}} to enable electrons to pass into the gas via thermionic emission at the lamp operating voltages used. The mix is slowly sputtered off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting the lamp has {{a significant impact on}} this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail. The sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps. When all the emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at the designed lamp operating voltage. Ideally, the control gear should shut down the lamp when this happens. However, some control gear will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating the lamp in cold cathode mode, which will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> fill and stopping the gas discharge.|$|E

The proton yield production for deuterium filling gas is determined by using the beam-target character of the pinched plasma and moving boiler model.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{high-pressure}} binary diffusion coefficient cal-culation is proposed based on considerations originating from recasting both the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> kinetic {{theory and the}} Stokes-Einstein infinite dilution expressions into forms consistent with corresponding states theory.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} experiments worldwide attempting {{to detect the}} energy deposition {{that is expected to}} occur when a WIMP directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter. Ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom in a target material. The DRIFT detectors vary from the majority of WIMP detectors in their use of a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> as a target material. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> means that an interaction within the detector causes an ionisation track of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials. Such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the type of particle that caused it, but from which direction the particle came. This directional sensitivity has the potential to prove the existence of WIMPs by their distinct directional signature.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{electronic}} resonance enhancement on the line broadening for Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and related third-order non linear processes, in <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gases.</b> These phenomena are analysed theoretically within the framework of a time-ordered diagrammatic representation of nonlinear polarizations. Diagrams facilitate the classification of the various physical processes and provide a way to readily derive all the susceptibility contributions. In CARS, the susceptibility terms which are Doppler-free and thus prevail in the Doppler limit are different from those which dominate in the collision broadening regime. This causes important changes in the spectral content. On the contrary, the same terms are seen to dominate, in both regimes, in coherent Stokes Raman scattering or in stimulated Raman scattering. Typical line contours are displayed. The generalization to all nonlinear processes is outlined...|$|R
