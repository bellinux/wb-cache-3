40|$|ABSTRACT Governments and {{companies}} are continually {{faced with a}} challenge to effectively manage all risks so as to protect their assets, financial health, property, reputation, constituents, and natural resources. “Risk management is the decision-making process whereby a policy or regulation is developed after a risk has been identified and is integrated with other issues including political, social, historical, and economic factors” (Zondi, 2000). In South Africa, environmental risk (i. e. risks associated with environmental damage and compliance) in waste management is currently considered {{in the setting of}} standards for landfill siting, design and water quality monitoring. It is the author’s opinion that this current approach has been poorly managed because potential sources of major environmental liability have not been identified and quantified (DWAF, 1998). Environmental liability is defined as the obligation to compensate or restore the environmental damage caused by the past, use, release, or threatened release of a particular substance; or by other activities that adversely affect the environment and/or human health (ICMA, 2001). The author looks at a case study of a landfill in Johannesburg highlighting their implementation of the water quality monitoring plan and proposes that the monitoring plan be integrated into a proposed environmental liability and risk management approach to managing ground water pollution from landfill sites. As not every landfill {{is the same as the}} other, a comprehensive analysis as stated in the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) Minimum Requirements (1998) is used to gather a list of relevant parameters for that landfill. The comprehensive analysis constitutes macro-constituents and all other constituents likely to be present in quantities higher than the normal background values or to contaminate the groundwater storage (aquifer) in the future. Once done, the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> can then discuss with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) on how to prioritise the parameters. They would also decide which parameters are to be used for the regular indicator analysis when monitoring because of cost reasons. All the parameters above background value are to be used as environmental liability parameters for that landfill site. The indicator analysis constitutes measurement of the most likely parameters that would, at an early stage, indicate the possibility of groundwater pollution. It is to be used in the regular monitoring exercises at the landfill by the operator. If an indicator parameter exceeds standards, a full comprehensive analysis must be performed and reported to DEAT. Each environmental liability parameter will be assigned a penalty charge and weight depending on a number of factors including: • Location of the landfill i. e. distance to acquifer and GW level • Geology of area • Type of aquifer • Type of landfill i. e. General of Hazardous • Risk level of that parameter to human health i. e. Health Risk Assessment The author proposes the introduction of an environmental liability costs fund with a compulsory monthly fee, which will be set up by both the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> and the relevant government department. The water quality monitoring protocol will not differ much from the present structure. If pollution is shown during detection monitoring and a further detailed investigation indicates that exposure is higher than allowable limits, then a combined environmental liability penalty will be evaluated and the monetary value will be charged into the landfill operator’s account in the liability costs fund, although the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> and DEAT can decide to use another method to determine the environmental liability e. g. liability insurance assessors. If the penalty required exceeds what has been accumulated in the liability fund account, then the difference will be demanded directly from the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator.</b> If the quarterly monitoring reports compiled by the operators show no mitigation claims into the liability find then the money accumulates in their account and a certain percentage will be paid back to the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> as an incentive...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the adoption of environmental bodies in two English counties is based theoretically upon an industrial interpretation of suitable environmental protection measures for the municipal waste management sector, and empirically upon a survey of waste disposal contractors in the case study regions. The Government is actively attempting to shift the emphasis of municipal waste management further up its hierarchy of waste options, so that the industry's dependence upon an ever diminishing landfill resource is reduced. In the wake of recycling targets, recycling credits, minimisation trials and general waste related policy and legislation, the Government has enforced the landfill tax, to artificially raise the cost of landfill. However, of perhaps greater significance than the tax, are the associated environmental bodies which {{can be set up}} to reclaim up to 20 % of the disposal company's landfill tax payments, to be used for the initiation of local environmental improvement schemes. There is great scope for the use of landfill tax credits, for the reclamation and restoration of land, pollution reduction schemes, the restoration of historical and religious buildings, and most importantly for research and education programmes. The awareness of the potential of these bodies in providing positive local environmental improvement is assessed by focusing upon their adoption by, and the involvement of, private sector <b>landfill</b> <b>operators</b> in the counties of Northampton and Surrey. Environmental bodies are currently being viewed warily by the industry, with little firm commitment to initiate bodies or provide funding for existing bodies. However, the results do suggest that the bodies, which are currently being set up in isolation from the <b>landfill</b> <b>operators.</b> will eventually be successful in attracting funding from <b>landfill</b> <b>operators,</b> providing an important source of funding for local environmental initiatives...|$|R

40|$|The Naboro {{landfill}} in Suva, {{the capital}} city of Fiji Islands, is a sanitary engineered landfill, consisting of a compacted clay protective liner and leachate collection system. The waste is selectively placed, compacted and then covered with soil. The landfill was commisioned in 2005 and is currently receiving an average of 70, 000 tonnes of waste annually. The municipal solid waste deposited in the landfill undergoes anaerobic decomposition and the methane gas generated escapes into the atmosphere, adding to the national greenhouse gas inventory. Currently there are no methane recovery and biogas utilisation technology in place or methane flaring at the Naboro landfill site.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} represents nowadays one of {{the most}} important issue related to the waste management cycle. Knowledge about leachate distribution and transport as well as fate of pollutants is fundamental for understanding the behavior of the landfill reactor. In the present study, a simple 1 -D mathematical model was developed for the simulation of the vertical leachate fluxes throughout a landfill for MSW as well as the fate of inorganic pollutants within the landfill leachate pathway. The model was based on mass balance equations, which allowed to evaluate the moisture accumulation inside the landfill body as well as contaminant transport processes. The model enables to calculate the moisture content and the simulation of continuous moisture distribution was carried out on the basis of the theory of the vertically distributed unsaturated flow. The model has been applied to a real landfill considered as a case study. The observed results highlight that the proposed simple 1 -D model can be a useful tool to analyze the landfill body as an unsaturated porous medium. The simulation results were in good agreement with the real leachate data provided by the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The re-introduction of {{leachate}} {{back into}} the waste {{can play an important}} part in landfill management. It can encourage biodegradation by raising the water content and transporting bacteria, nutrients and waste products. It also enables leachate to be stored within the body of the landfill, for example to help minimise temporal variations in the load on a leachate treatment plant. It is helpful for a <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> to be able to estimate {{the rate at which the}} landfill can accept leachate (the maximum infiltration or injection rate), the storage capacity of the landfill and the leachate retention time. This paper discusses some of the insights obtained from the development and application of a simple conceptual model of leachate recirculation that can be used to estimate key parameter values on the basis of the hydraulic properties of the waste. The model is described, partly validated against a more rigorous numerical analysis, and then used to interpret data obtained from field tests on a real site. The shortcomings of the model in its current form are discussed, and suggestions are made as to how these might be addressed in the context of developing the model as a design tool...|$|E

40|$|The hazards {{associated}} with the possible collapse of old mine workings underlying an active landfill site in north-east England {{have been identified as}} a significant concern to both the regulatory authorities and to the <b>landfill</b> <b>operator.</b> A quantitative assessment of the hazards and their perceived risks to the integrity of the composite lining system in place beneath the landfill has been undertaken using a combination of field observation, established mine subsidence prediction tools and numerical modelling techniques. Field observations have identified the presence of extensive fissuring within the limestone underlying the site, however, it is difficult to assess the extent to which mining has contributed to the development of these features. In light of this, an influence function technique has been used to attempt to predict the degree of fracturing that could have been experienced at the surface due solely to mining, with the intention of illustrating whether the scale of movements on pre-existing joints could be attributed to mining subsidence. The results of this analysis have subsequently been used within a finite-difference numerical model to assess the effect that a fracture of the scale predicted would have on the composite lining system...|$|E
30|$|With {{stringent}} requirement {{by authorities}} in protecting environmental fate, the treatability of landfill leachate is a prominent {{challenge for the}} <b>landfill</b> <b>operator</b> {{to comply with the}} current regulations. With regards to this, conventional treatment is not sufficient to render high concentration of leachate pollutants. Therefore, the adverse impacts of inefficient leachate treatment have raised serious concerns to the society and environment, respectively. Ultimately, the combination of individual treatment process into hybrid process has been more effective and emerged as the choice of treatment for landfill operators. Kwon et al. (2008) found that higher reduction of CODcr, color and TP could be achieved when they employed nanofiltration-rotary disk membrane (NF-RDM) process. In addition, the introduction of RO with NF-RDM process enhanced NH 4 + removal from 25 to 92  %. In another study, Tsilogeorgis et al. (2008) concluded that ultrafiltration membrane-SBR was able to remove TN removal (88  % maximum) over 4  months monitoring. However, COD removal varied (40 – 60  %) due to high SRT. Also, PO 4 –P removal efficiency was varied (35 – 45  %) during the first 50  days of operation due to direct addition of KH 2 PO 4 /K 2 HPO 4 that was aimed to improve C:N:P ratio.|$|E
40|$|Despite today’s {{intensive}} efforts {{directed at}} the recycling and recovery of solid wastes, the controlled disposal of waste into land remains an important and necessary means of effective waste management. Due to the potentially harmful effects associated with methane and carbon dioxide emissions and leachate land contamination, the monitoring of a landfill is an activity which is inherent in all phases of the site life cycle from the initial appraisal to the operational and post-closure phases.

The few previous studies performed show the value of earth observation data for mapping landcover around landfills and monitoring vegetation health. However, these were largely qualitative studies limited to single sensor types. The review of these studies highlights three key aspects.

40|$|Modern waste {{management}} tends towards greater sustainability in landfilling, with {{the implementation of}} strategies such as the pretreatment of solid waste. This work assesses the behaviour of rejects from a refining stage of mechanically-biologically treated municipal solid waste at the landfill. The main results of 18 months' monitoring of an experimental pilot cell with waste from a full-scale plant are presented. This first stages are expected to be the most problematic period for this type of waste. The evolution of the temperature and the composition of leachate and gas at various points within the cell are included. During the first weeks, pollutant concentrations in the leachate exceeded the reference ranges in the literature, coinciding with a rapid onset of methanogenic conditions. However, there was a quick wash, reducing concentrations to below one third of the initial values before the first year. pH values influenced concentrations of some pollutants such as copper. These results indicate that, right from the beginning of disposal, such facilities should be prepared to treat a high pollution load in the leachate and install the gas emissions control elements due to the rapid onset of methanogenesis.

40|$|Sanitary {{landfills}} for {{municipal solid}} wastes {{can be considered}} as large biological reactors where the organic fraction of municipal solid waste undergoes anaerobic digestion producing gas and liquid emissions. Leachate production from municipal sanitary landfills is currently recognized as a major environmental burden associated with municipal solid waste management and it may be responsible for local pollution of groundwater and soil. Moreover, the fate of the organic compounds within the landfill body is of primary importance since it directly influences the production of landfill gas. The aim of the paper is to propose an integrated mathematical model able to simulate, on one hand, the vertical leachate fluxes throughout a municipal solid waste landfill (considering the fate of both inorganic and organic contaminants within the landfill leachate pathway), while, on the other hand, the production of landfill gas by means of two different approaches. In detail, the mathematical model was based on mass balance equations and was composed by two sub-models: one for the simulation of moisture distribution, whilst the other one for the simulation of the organic/inorganic contaminant concentrations. The simulation of landfill gas production was based on two different approaches. The integrated model has been applied to a real landfill considered as a case study, the landfill of Pescantina (Italy), with the landfill body divided into N horizontal layers.
