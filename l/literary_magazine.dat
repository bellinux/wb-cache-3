5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture.

50|$|Around 1996, online <b>literary</b> <b>magazines</b> {{began to}} appear.
