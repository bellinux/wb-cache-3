Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that [...] "for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E

In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep my hand in the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E

He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E

In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million [...] "in a six-hour period" [...] while playing blackjack. Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems.

As the verse continues, Carey makes references and comparisons to their love and drugs powerful effect over the body and its senses. Carey describes the limits of her love during the chorus, singing [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> breathe" [...] and [...] "Eternally".

Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded {{positively to}} [...] "A Quiet Night In". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember– {{one of those}} fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". He chose not to reveal {{too much about the}} plot for fear of [...] "spoiling the fun". Chater later described the episode as [...] "mindboggling in its originality", and [...] "one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a [...] "triumph", while writers for Metro described the episode as [...] "quality comedy", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a [...] "brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was [...] "beautifully choreographed", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's [...] "willingness to attempt difficult concepts".|$|E

The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky.

500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though {{it was felt that}} the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} made {{available}} for streaming at Big Boi's MySpace page. Following leaks of several of its tracks, the album also leaked in its entirety to the Internet on June 29. Prior to its official release, anti-piracy companies had estimated that his tracks were being downloaded approximately 45,000 times a day. On July 1, Big Boi self-released his mixtape Mixtape for Dummies: Guide to Global Greatness as a free download through his website, featuring tracks compiled by DJ X-Rated and DJ Esco from Big Boi's solo recordings and work with OutKast. Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty was released by Big Boi's imprint Purple Ribbons label and Def Jam Recordings on July 5 in the United Kingdom and on July 6 in the US. A deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously in the US, with the inclusion of two bonus tracks and a second DVD of music videos for several songs. Big Boi's official website store offered limited edition releases of the album, including the deluxe edition's two discs, ivory white vinyl LPs, a limited edition T-shirt, and a custom GoodWood chain. In promotion of the album's release, Converse produced a special limited edition run of Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoes in August 2010. The shoes were designed by Big Boi himself and feature the album title printed around the outer sides of the shoe's heel. On the collaboration, Big Boi {{said in a statement}} [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember music and Converse have gone hand in hand, so partnering up with them was a no-brainer".|$|E

40|$|In an (unpublished) {{letter by}} von Neumann to Schrödinger (dated April 11, 1936) von Neumann replies to Schrödinger’s two famous 1935 papers, {{in which the}} notion of {{entanglement}} between spatially separated quantum systems is introduced and the probabilistic correlations arising from entanglement is discussed {{from the perspective of}} a possible clash between quantum mechanics and the principle of physical locality.

He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do.

There are two contracting frictions: households privately observe their endowments, and they cannot commit to a contract. Banks can commit to eviction after payment default. Households honor contractual repayments <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>i)</b> they <b>can</b> a¤ord it, and ii) they prefer to do so rather than exercise endogenous outside options in mortgage and housing markets. Loan-to-income ratios, home prices, trading volume, and default rates are joint equilibrium outcomes that we characterize in quasi-closed forms. Both the systematic and idiosyncratic components of income risk reduce debt capacities, albeit through quite distinct channels. Thus, the net impact of the diversi…ability of income risk on mortgage capacity and home prices is ambiguous. The paper also shows that these contracting frictions rule out some types of rational bubbles that would be sustainable in a frictionless economy, and studies the impact of bubbly equilibrium price paths on mortgage terms...|$|R
