40|$|Analysis {{of human}} running has {{revealed}} that {{the motion of the}} human leg can be modeled by a compression spring because the joints of the leg behave like a torsion spring in the stance phase. In this paper, we describe the development of a joint mechanism that mimics the elastic characteristics of the joints of the stance leg. The knee was equipped with a mechanism comprising two <b>laminated</b> <b>leaf</b> springs made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic for adjusting the joint stiffness and a worm gear in order to achieve active movement. Using this mechanism, we were able to achieve joint stiffness mimicking that of a human knee joint that can be adjusted by varying the effective length of one of the <b>laminated</b> <b>leaf</b> springs. The equation proposed for calculating the joint stiffness considers the difference between the position of the fixed point of the leaf spring and the position of the rotational center of the joint. We evaluated the performance of the <b>laminated</b> <b>leaf</b> spring and the effectiveness of the proposed equation for joint stiffness. We were able to make a bipedal robot run with one leg using pelvic oscillation for storing energy produced by the resonance related to leg elasticity...|$|E
40|$|The {{leaf springs}} {{are widely used}} in {{suspension}} system of railway carriages and automobiles. But the form {{in which it is}} normally seen is <b>laminated</b> <b>leaf</b> spring. To assure proper spring life, the maintenance and inspection process must include the entire suspension system of springs and chassis parts. The motoring public has learned that proper maintenance on their vehicles is essential to obtain longer life and economical service in this age of rising equipment and fuel costs. In most normal maintenance checks, the spring suspension system is sorely overlooked, but a minimum of attention to the spring suspension would yield a longer and more reliable suspension system service. In this report,FEM approach has used for predicting the stress and deformation. A parametric study is also made by varying the load to investigate their effect on the stress of leaf spring. A frequency response graph is plotted to analyse the effect of Stress, Strain and Deformation...|$|E

In this work due to reduce the weight of steel spring with composite leaf spring due to high strength ratio is need to improve. The main aim is to compare to the load carrying capacity, stiffness and weight savings of composite leaf spring with that of steel leaf spring at rated-load and over-load condition. The analysis {{has been carried out}} for the leaf spring made up of steel and Composite materials. Composite specimens are fabricated with two different staking sequences like the (resin with clay and enhanced with Nanoparticles).

40|$|Leaf {{spring is}} a simple form of {{suspension}} spring used to absorb vibrations induced during the motion of a vehicle. The automobile industry has shown increased interest in the replacement of steel leaf spring (65 Si 7) with hybrid composite leaf spring with Jute/E-glass/Epoxy due to high strength to weight ratio, higher stiffness, high impact energy absorption and lesser stresses. This research is aimed to investigate the suitability of natural and synthetic fiber reinforced hybrid composite material in automobile leaf spring application. By using natural fibers efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the cost and weight of leaf spring. A hybrid composite leaf spring with Jute/E-glass/Epoxy composite materials is modeled and subjected to the same load as that of a steel spring. The hybrid composite leaf spring has been modeled by their consideration. Static structural analysis of a leaf spring has been performed using ANSYS 14.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} which leave will be displayed {{and the time of}} collection of this leave. The treatments consisted on five doses of nitrogen, four times for collection sampling and three types of leaves, arranged in a randomized block design with three repetitions, totalizing one hundred and forty-four experimental units. The leaves collections took place every fifteen days at thirty, forty-five, sixty and seventy five days after budbreak (DAB), collecting the laminated / compound young leaf (first leave), newly mature (second leave) and the mature leave (third leave) from the set of terminal leaflets. For this was installed an experiment with the culture of potato (cv. Atlantic), in Barretos/SP, the period of march the june of 2010. According to this data collected in this study, the best time for collecting the leaves is at 30 days after the budbreak of the potato cultivation containing nitrogen concentrations in the leaves minus heterogeneous of plants from a fraction to another and with values R 2 = 0. 98 being higher to the all times of harvests. To the diagnostic leaf, the highest determination coefficient was observed in the newly mature (second leaf) with R 2 = 0. 98. It can be observed that the highest levels of nitrogen were found on the first leaf (39. 01 kg- 1). Nevertheless, the values were very heterogeneous and did not fit the curve being the second leave (newly mature) the one that best represents the nutritional status of the plant. Therefore the recommendation for nutritional diagnosis will collect the recently matured leaves (2 nd leaf) 30 days after budbreak. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a adubação nitrogenada na cultura da batata e determinar a folha e a época de amostragem foliar adequada para avaliação do estado nutricional da cultura. Os tratamentos foram constituídos de 5 doses de nitrogênio, 4 épocas de coleta e 3 tipos de folhas, dispostos em um delineamento em blocos ao acaso, com 3 repetições. As coletas das folhas foram realizadas a cada 15 dias, aos 30, 45, 60 e 75 dias após a brotação (DAB), coletando-se a primeira, segunda e terceira folha recém-madura da planta. Para isto foi instalado um experimento com a cultura da batata (cv. Atlantic), em Barretos/SP, no período de março a junho de 2010. De acordo com os dados coletados neste estudo, a melhor época para a coleta de folhas é aos 30 dias após a brotação da cultura da batata contendo teores de nitrogênio nas folhas menos heterogêneos de plantas de uma parcela para outra e com valor R 2 = 0, 98, sendo superior a todas as épocas de coleta. Para a folha diagnóstica o maior coeficiente de determinação foi verificado para a folha recém-madura (folha 2 ª) com R 2 = 0, 98. Nota-se que os maiores teores de nitrogênio encontram-se na folha 1 ª (39, 01 g kg- 1), entretanto os valores foram muito heterogêneos e não se ajustaram a curva sendo a folha 2 ª (recém-madura) que melhor representa o estado nutricional da planta. Portanto a recomendação para diagnose foliar será coletar a folha recém-madura (folha 2 ª) aos 30 dias após a brotação.  Nitrogen fertilization and leaf sampling criteria potato cropThe present study aimed {{to determine which}} leave will be displayed and the time of collection ofthis leave.
