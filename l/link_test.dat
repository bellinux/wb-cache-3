This study has applied two Rasch model techniques, Angoffs sum of probability and Andrich's pairwise comparison, to set cutoff scores for a Tasmanian Year 9 <b>Link</b> <b>Test</b> at year 3, year 5 and year 8 level. The main focus {{of the study was to}} examine methods of setting cutoff scores in the context of the National Profiles. The study also aimed at examining the relative difficulty of two parts of the <b>Link</b> <b>Test</b> on Mathematics for Year 9 students in Tasmania. Standard setting issues were analysed in the light of criterion referenced assessment in terms of their purposes and implications in education and measurement. Review of previous standard setting methods was also done. The two methods applied in the study were Angoff's sum of probabilities and Andrich's pairwise comparison. Both are popular in the educational context for establishing cutoff scores and examining the difficulty levels of tests. The findings produced by the sum of probability method have shown that cutoff score at each level of part 1 was higher than that of part 2, so that part 2 of the <b>Link</b> <b>Test</b> was more difficult than part 1. It was consistent with the item estimates produced by the pairwise comparison method. The correlations were high and significant at 0. 05 level. It was consistent to those findings by Andrich and Titmanis (1997). However, the correlations between item difficulty estimates established by the pairwise comparison and empirical data were low from 0. 39. The study has shown the possibility of using the two Rasch model techniques, sum of probability and pairwise comparison to establish cutoff score and examine the relative difficulty of the tests. Pairwise comparison method could be used as a mean of checking the validity of the proposed standards. It was shown that further research in this field should be done.

40|$|The upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{scheduled}} for the shut-down period of 2018 - 2019 (Phase-I upgrade), will increase the instantaneous luminosity to about three times the design value. Since the current ATLAS trigger system does not allow a corresponding increase of the trigger rate, an improvement of the trigger system is required. The new trigger signals from the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter will be arranged in 34000 so-called Super Cells which achieve 5 - 10 times better granularity than the current system; this improves the background rejection capabilities through more precise energy measurements, {{and the use of}} shower shapes to discriminate electrons and photons from jets.

40|$|The Nigerian {{economy in}} the last two decades up until 2013 has been growing at an average of 6 % and yet {{unemployment}} was equally growing in the region of 20 % within the same period. This paradoxical situation has led to a flurry of studies and postulations aimed at providing explanation and solution to the phenomenon. This study making use of a regression model with annual data from 1980 to 2013, empirically determined the impact of public sector expenditures (CEXP and REXP) together with private sector investment (PINV) on unemployment (UNEMP) in Nigeria. Capital expenditure and private sector investment both in the medium to long-run were found to serve as catalyst towards reduction of unemployment, while recurrent expenditure was not statistically strong enough to do same. The R- 2 (0. 84) showed that greater proportion of the total variations in UNEMP was brought about by variations in the regressors. Further tests like autocorrelation, hetroscedasticity, specification error, and multicollinearity indicated respectively that there is no presence of autocorrelation hence the model produced a parsimonious result; the variance is constant over time; the <b>link</b> <b>test</b> confirmed by Ramsey reset test suggested there was no specification error; and lastly the variance inflation factor (VIF) of the variables implies that there is no evidence of multicollinearity. The study recommends, inter alia, that the proportion of capital expenditure in Nigerian budget profile should be systematically increased while the recurrent expenditure should be reduced; and there is need to stimulate competition among investors through removal of structural and institutional rigidities and government should design clear policy incentives to private sector investment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{scheduled}} for the 2019 – 2020 shut-down period, referred to as Phase-I upgrade, will increase the instantaneous luminosity to about three times the design value. Since the current ATLAS trigger system does not allow sufficient increase of the trigger rate, an improvement of the trigger system is required. The Liquid Argon (LAr) Calorimeter read-out will therefore be modified to deliver digital trigger signals with a higher spatial granularity {{in order to improve}} the identification efficiencies of electrons, photons, tau, jets and missing energy, at high background rejection rates at the Level- 1 trigger. The new trigger signals will be arranged in 34000 so-called Super Cells which achieves 5 – 10 times better granularity than the trigger towers currently used and allows an improved background rejection. The readout of the trigger signals will process the signal of the Super Cells at every LHC bunch-crossing at 12 -bit precision and a frequency of 40 MHz. The data will be transmitted to the Back End using a custom serializer and optical converter and 5. 12 Gb/s optical links. In order to verify the full functionality of the future Liquid Argon trigger system, a demonstrator set-up has been installed on the ATLAS detector and is operated in parallel to the regular ATLAS data taking during the LHC Run- 2 in 2015 and 2016. Noise level and linearity on the energy measurement have been verified to be within our requirements. In addition, we have collected data from 13 TeV proton collisions during the LHC 2015 and 2016 runs, and have observed real pulses from the detector through the demonstrator system. The talk will give an overview of the Phase-I Upgrade of the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter readout and present the custom developed hardware including their role in real-time data processing and fast data transfer. This contribution will also report on the performance of the newly developed ASICs including their radiation tolerance and on the performance of the prototype boards in the demonstrator system based on various measurements with the 13 TeV collision data.

40|$|A network-on-chip (NoC), the de-facto {{communication}} backbone in manycore processors, consumes {{a significant}} portion of total chip power, competing against the computation cores for the limited power and thermal budget. On the other hand, overall system performance of manycore chips increasingly relies on on-chip latency and bandwidth as core counts scale. This thesis aims to design low-power yet high-performance NoCs through circuit and microarchitecture co-design contrary to the traditional approaches where NoCs sacrifice latency and/or bandwidth for low-power operation; then demonstrate such design concepts through test chip prototyping, enabling detailed measurements for rigorous analysis of {{the pros and cons of}} the proposed NoCs. The thesis starts with a 4 x 4 mesh NoC chip prototype that tries to simultaneously optimize energy, latency and throughput for all kinds of traffic (unicasts, multicasts and broadcasts). Its extensive experiment results make it possible to accurately analyze energy/performance benefits and timing/area overheads of the virtually bypassed, multicast-optimized router design; energy savings, area overheads and reduced reliability of the clocked low-swing datapath circuits; and a power gap between simulated estimations and measurement results. Next demonstrated is a <b>link</b> <b>test</b> chip of two clockless low-swing repeater designs, a self-resetting logic repeater (SRLR) optimized for transmission energy and a voltage-locked repeater (VLR) for transmission delay. This second chip prototype shows that the clockless, single-ended low-swing signaling of SRLRs armed with variation-robust circuit techniques has lower energy and smaller area than clocked, differential lowswing signaling. Featured with lower delay than full-swing repeaters, VLRs provide the fundamental building block to the single-cycle reconfigurable NoC that enables potential power saving at architecture level through single-cycle multi-hop asynchronous link traversal on dynamically configurable routes. The last one-third of this thesis explores a 3 D-IC chip prototype of a throughsilicon via (TSV) interconnect that can support simultaneously bi-directional (SBD) signaling. While TSVs, as 3 D-IC NoC links, offer an appealing solution to manycore architectures that require huge off-die bandwidth, existing TSV technologies impose considerable power and area overheads (using spare TSVs) to improve reliability. The proposed SBD TSV circuit shows better energy efficiency and smaller area than unidirectional TSVs, thus providing reliable 3 D signaling within tight power/silicon budget. Such SBD signaling also enables configurable off-die bandwidth, and hence, can be the basis of a bandwidth-adaptive 3 D NoC that efficiently supports highly dynamic traffic on manycore chips. by Sunghyun Park.

40|$|Limited {{by what is}} {{reported}} in the literature, most systematic reviews of medical tests focus on “test accuracy ” (or better, test performance), {{rather than on the}} impact of testing on patient outcomes.
