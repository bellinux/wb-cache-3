5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as {{this would be an}} uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E
25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of {{high tensile strength}} and extensibility (ductility).

25|$|Chemical rockets are {{the most}} common type of high power rocket, {{typically}} creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellants), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous.

25|$|A dam which impounds a large {{reservoir}} {{can store}} and release a correspondingly <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night, dams are still required to release {{enough water to}} maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood {{for a few hours}} each day.|$|E
25|$|Through productivity-enhancing {{investments}} in fixed capital, {{the use of}} a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> (heat energy from peat as an industrial fuel, wind power) per worker, and a substantial investment in human capital (as witnessed by the high literacy rate), the Dutch managed to raise labor productivity above the levels prevailing in other European countries. This is illustrated by {{the fact that in the}} mid-17th century the agricultural sector, employing less than 40 percent of the labor force, could already almost be a net food exporter (which it became by 1800), and the fact that nominal wages between 1600 and 1800 were the highest in Europe. In the open economy of the Republic such a wage gap could only be sustained by enduring productivity differences.|$|E

25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, {{there are two types}} of fuel. The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second type of fuel is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, then it becomes a fissile isotope by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> required to melt ice (the latent heat of fusion, 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants live in habitats {{with high}} light, waterlogged soils, and extremely low soil nitrogen and phosphorus, producing the ecological impetus to derive nitrogen from an alternate source. High light environments {{allowed for the}} trade off between photosynthetic leaves and prey capturing traps that are photosynthetically inefficient. To compensate for photosynthetically inefficient material, the nutrients obtained through carnivory would need to increase photosynthesis by investing in more leaf mass, i.e. growing. This means {{when there is a}} shortage of nutrients and enough light and water, prey capture and digestion has the greatest impact on photosynthetic gains, favoring the evolution of plant adaptations which allowed for more effective and efficient carnivory. Due to the <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and resources allocated to carnivorous adaptations. i.e. the production of lures, digestive enzymes, modified leaf structures, and the decreased rate of photosynthesis over total leaf area, some authors argue that carnivory is an evolutionary last resort when nitrogen and phosphorus are limited in an ecosystem.|$|E

Megabats were generally believed to be only homeothermic, however three species of small megabats, with a body mass of about , {{have been known to}} use torpor: [...] the common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis), the long-tongued nectar bat (Macroglossus minimus), and the eastern tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene robinsoni).

500|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{implosion}} {{is to use}} chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a critical mass, where neutron multiplication leads to a nuclear chain reaction, releasing a <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> [...] Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by Seth Neddermeyer, but von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing ammunition, was a vocal advocate of spherical implosion driven by explosive lenses. [...] He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues, and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion. [...] Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids.
