40|$|ABSTRACT The article {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the European Employment Strategy on German policies. The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Process</b> contains concrete, quantitative objectives as well as relatively heterogeneous proposals that allow rather antithetical national poli-cies. Nevertheless, it marks a specific European path, emphasising state–led activation strategies. Applying clear and verifiable criteria, we analyse {{the impact of}} the guidelines, the quantified objectives and the recommendations on German employment policies and find that they selectively influenced German policies, normally catalysing existing policies (‘intensifier effects’), but sometimes also inducing a policy change (‘steering effects’). The impact varies depending on the concreteness of the guidelines and the party composition of the government...|$|E
40|$|The European Employment Strategy is now {{seven years}} old. Whilst its {{contribution}} to improving labour market performance has been evaluated, less {{attention has been paid}} to the manner in which the EES has worked, in particular the ways in which policy has been formulated and implemented. In particular, there has been little investigation of the extent to which one of the stated objectives of the strategy – the improved involvement of the social partners in the formulation and imple-mentation of policy – has been achieved. This paper argues that in many respects this objective has not been met. Even in countries where social partnership structures appear relatively well developed, the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>process</b> has added little – in part because it is seen to be concerned with technical matters. Employment policy is ‘settled’ elsewhere. In addition, realisation of those elements of the strategy where social partner participation is most critical has often been frustrated by the lack of mechanisms to implement commitments made at the centre at places of work. Moreover, by subscribing to the strategy, social partners were also subscribing to a wider approach to economic policy – an approach that was scarcely compatible with the approach advocated by trade unions. Accordingly, the conclusion has to be that the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>process</b> failed to develop social partnership. An exception might be the closer working together of the European-level social partner associations. However, their involvement in the strategy has been little noticed by their constituents, and it might even be argued to have encouraged elitism rather than to have promoted greater participation in policy-making...|$|E
40|$|Introduction by Mark A. Pollack, series editor]. THE PORTUGUESE PRESIDENCY, WHICH {{organized}} {{the work of}} the Council during {{the first six months of}} the year, was tasked with the heavy responsibility of organizing the opening months of the 2000 IGC (see Dinan and Vanhoonacker, this issue), yet the Portuguese also embarked on a major campaign to sponsor an academic and political debate on economic reform, and on the future of European economic governance. Throughout their presidency, the Portuguese sought to stimulate a debate on both the substance and process of European economic policymaking, proposing a "new strategic goal for the Union in order to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. " Toward this end, the presidency commissioned a series of papers from both distinguished academics and EU institutions on subjects ranging from employment policy to the reform of the welfare state, modernization of public services, social inclusion, and the information society and e-commerce (for an on-line listing and texts of these reports, see Portuguese Presidency 2000). In March, the presidency organized a special European Council, which largely endorsed the Portuguese program of economic reform, with particularly detailed statements on the information society and the promotion of e-commerce. As important as the substance of the proposed reforms, however, is the process proposed by the Portuguese presidency, and endorsed by the Lisbon European Council, dubbed "open coordination. " As Jim Mosher explains below, open coordination involves the establishment of common social policy guidelines, indicators and "benchmarks," which are intended to guide national policies through a process of policy coordination and peer evaluation. Although the practice of open coordination is not itself new, having been pioneered in recent years in a trio of joint policy processes (namely the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Process</b> on employment, the Cardiff process on structural reforms, and the Cologne process on macroeconomic policy coordination), the explicit endorsement of open coordination in Lisbon raises a number of important questions about the future of European economic governance, which are addressed by three ECSA members in this Forum. In the first essay, Martin Rhodes analyzes the outcome of the Lisbon European Council as a pragmatic effort by the EU to find a "Third Way" between the traditionally conflicting imperatives of economic efficiency and equality, and between the extremes of European harmonization and national autonomy. In the process, he suggests, the presidency has created a "new European architecture for social policy" which will rationalize existing processes under the umbrella of a broader economic strategy and an annual Spring meeting of the European Council. In the second essay, Janine Goetschy looks back at the record of open coordination in the most developed of the three current processes, the European Employment Strategy, noting both the strengths and the weaknesses of the process during its formative years. In the third and final essay, Jim Mosher places the emerging process of open coordination in the context of a broader move to "post-regulatory governance," which promises both functional and political advantages to member governments eager to cooperate in a flexible fashion, but also the familiar dangers of "voluntarism" and weak or uneven national implementation of common EU goals. Despite differences in emphasis and in levels of optimism about the future, all three essays echo Rhodes' conclusion that the Lisbon European Council is likely to emerge as a watershed in EU social policy, in terms of both the articulation of a new set of common policy goals for the member states, and the endorsement of new policy processes which may-or may not-serve to facilitate the achievement of those goals in the coming years...|$|E

When the Single Market came into force on 1 January 1993, this opened new perspectives for the Luxembourgish economy, which depended almost entirely on foreign markets. However, economic integration also presented dangers. During EC negotiations, the Luxembourgish government opposed a harmonisation of indirect taxation, {{which would have been}} harmful to cross-border trade; and also opposed a withholding tax, which would have seen capital flee from the Luxembourg financial centre.|$|R
40|$|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is an {{economic}} and monetary policy system based on a fundamental asymmetry and consisting of three elements: 1. an independent central bank (ECB) which is exclusively charged with monetary policy in the euro zone; 2. economic policies (fiscal and budgetary policies) which continue to be pursued individually at member state level but which are subject to specified common rules (specifically the stability and growth pact (SGP), the procedure {{in the case of}} an excessive deficit and the acquis communautaire of the single market); and, finally, 3. recognition that economic policies by the member states are a matter of "common concern" which consequently need some amount of co-ordination at Council level. The ECB pursues its monetary policy at central level for all members of the euro zone. Its primary objective is to achieve price stability in the euro zone. In its monetary policy strategy, the ECB concentrates on three key elements: a quantitative definition of price stability as the chief goal of the euro system (defined by the ECB as an inflation rate of not more than 2 percent), and a "two-pillar concept". For the "first pillar", a reference value of 4. 5 percent was specified for the growth of the money supply (M 3). The "second pillar" includes a whole bundle of business indicators in order to obtain adequate forecasts of inflation. In spite of an unfavourable international situation (oil price shock of 2000 - 01, global recession in 2001 - 02), the ECB was successful in shaping its monetary policy. EMU has not only revolutionised monetary policy but has also left a marked impression on the fiscal stability culture in the EU. The obligation to meet the convergence criteria alone has already reduced budget deficits in the EU markedly below 3 percent of GDP. With the entry into the third stage of EMU, the trend was further enhanced, not least due to the dictates of the stability and growth pact. Whereas in 1997 (prior to EMU entry) only three of the 15 EU member states (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) boasted of a budget surplus, their number had grown to nine countries in 2001. This not only interrupted the dynamic growth of the national debt but also contributed to making state finances more sustainable. But although the stability and growth pact fostered greater fiscal policy discipline, it still shows its inherent weaknesses in times of weak growth or recession. With competences clearly allocated (ECB exclusively in charge of monetary policy and EU member states in charge of economic policy), economic policy needs to be co-ordinated. Over time, complex mechanisms and a number of processes have been established (<b>Luxembourg</b> <b>process</b> for employment, Cardiff process for structural policy and functioning of the single market, Cologne process for macroeconomic dialogue, Lisbon process for an open method of co-ordination). An annual rhythm of multilateral monitoring has been formed within the scope of the pact, accompanied by the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG). It is an open issue whether this elaborate (administrative, political) process does not already cancel out possible gains of co-ordination. In view of such findings, any demand for further and stronger co-ordination made (e. g. by the Commission) to the European Convention currently discussing the future Europe would thus be rather contra productive. It is especially in comparing the USA and EU in terms of their economic performance over the past decade that an analysis of the complex economic policy interactions within EMU may well lead to the conclusion that not only are labour and capital markets in the EU still too rigid but that its economic policy is still too inflexible.

40|$|The {{freeze-thaw}} cycles in periglacial areas {{during the}} Quaternary glacials increased frost weathering, {{leading to a}} disintegration of rock formations. Transported downslope, clasts allowed in some areas the formation of stratified slope deposits known as "grezes litees". This study reviews the existing theories and investigates the grezes litees deposits of Enscherange and Rodershausen in <b>Luxembourg.</b> This <b>process</b> was reinforced by the lithostructural control of the parent material expressed by the dip of schistosity (66 degrees) and its orientation parallel to the main slopes in the area. This gave opportunities to activate the frost-weathering process {{on top of the}} ridge where the parent material outcropped. As the stratified slope deposits have a dip of 23 degrees and as there is no significant lateral variation in rock fragment size, slope processes that involve only gravity are excluded and transportation in solifluction lobes with significant slopewash and sorting processes is hypothesized. The Enscherange formation, the biggest known outcrop of grezes litees in north-western Europe, shows evidence of clear layering over the whole profile depth. A palaeolandscape reconstruction shows that ridges must have been tens of metres higher than presently. The investigation of the matrix composition shows Laacher See tephra in the overlying periglacial cover bed with infiltrations of the minerals in the reworked upper layer of the grezes litees deposit. Chronostratigraphic approaches using the underlying cryoturbation zone and Laacher See heavy minerals in the overlying topsoil place the formation of grezes litees deposits in the Late Pleistocene...|$|R
50|$|Luxembourg has a {{well-developed}} {{program of}} victim support services {{through the state}} run Victim Support Service (part of the Ministry of Justice). It {{is one of only}} five Member States where the Ministry of Justice is solely responsible for the distribution of these services. Victims’ rights are also actively enforced during the different stages of the criminal justice process, including: during the investigation of a crime, during a trial and after a trial. The state also coordinates with non-profit organisations, including through the provision of financial support, in order to assist in the development of legal reforms and to better coordinate at a grass roots level. For example, one such organisation, Women in Distress, works to provide women, their children and young girls with effective protection against violence by way of refuges and information and consultation centres. Through this <b>process,</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> has become one of only nine Member States to fulfil the Council of Europe’s recommendation of one counselling centre per 50,000 women.|$|R
40|$|Since June 2011, the University of Luxembourg {{has started}} in {{collaboration}} with the University of Nottingham a PhD project entitled “The Potential of Precipitable Water Vapour Measurements using Global Navigation Satellite Systems in Luxembourg (PWVLUX) ”, which is funded by the Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR) Luxembourg. The research objectives of the project are to study the potential for improvements in short-term weather forecasts and long-term climate variability for Luxembourg and the Greater Region by inclusion of the observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the existing techniques. To achieve the research objectives, systems are being set up at the University of <b>Luxembourg</b> which <b>process</b> ground-based GNSS data for the provision of zenith total delay (ZTD) and integrated water vapour (IWV) estimates in real-time, near real-time and post-processing modes. Through collaboration with the Administration du cadastre et de la topographie (Luxembourg) and the Service public de Wallonie (Belgium), the coverage of the available GNSS permanent networks is improved over the primary project area, although also data from other European and global networks are processed. The meteorological analysis of the PWVLUX products is supported through collaborations with the Meteorological Service of the Administration de la navigation aérienne and the EUMETNET project E-GVAP. In this study we present the first ZTD and IWV estimates obtained from the near-real time processing systems in development at the University of Luxembourg. In a preliminary evaluation we compared their performance to some state-of-the-art systems already in operation and found that the ZTD estimates agree up to a few millimeters and the IWV estimates agree at the sub-millimeter level...|$|R

The 2014 - 2020 programming period of the Structural Funds offers an opportunity to support projects in this field at national, cross-border and transnational levels. This leaflet synthesises {{the results of a}} consultation process organised by the ESPON Contact Point of Luxembourg in summer and autumn 2013 in the framework of the USESPON project. First, it aimed at analysing the relevance of ESPON results in the field of research, development and innovation (RDI) in <b>Luxembourg.</b> Second, this <b>process</b> reflected on possible priorities for the future operational programmes of the structural funds. This process involved either experts in the field of RDI or those responsible for drafting operational programmes. The consultation process has been framed by a Delphi technique. First, participants received “support material” presenting the situation of Luxembourg according to the ESPON results. Second, they participated in a workshop on 11 th July 2013. Third, a synthesis {{based on the results of}} the workshop was provided together with a questionnaire giving the experts the opportunity to deepen and concretise their contribution. By summarising this consultation process, this leaflet aims at 1) working out a profile of Luxembourg on the basis of ESPON results in the field of RDI and 2) developing recommendations of how future-oriented innovation strategies can be implemented in the context of European Territorial Cooperation.
