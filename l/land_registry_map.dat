40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cadastral}} studies in Turkey {{can be summarized}} as determining the geometrical and judicial positions of real-estates and preparing their <b>land</b> <b>registries.</b> Cadastral <b>maps</b> are required for every type of planning and design studies, and supposed to serve {{a great variety of}} institutions and organizations like municipalities.

40|$|Since the mid of the 90 ’s the Unified Hungarian <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> {{has been}} {{operating}} in standardized environment. The cadastral database standard (MSZ 7772 - 1) and the standard-based regulations on surveying and the database have been elaborated by the Institute of Geodesy, Cartography and Remote Sensing (FÖMI). This solution {{is very similar to}} the Core Cadastral Domain Model (CCDM) produced by our Dutch colleagues. The Unified Hungarian <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> is a title registry, where the Hungarian State provides the authenticity of both data (<b>map</b> and <b>land</b> <b>registry)</b> [1, 2, 4, 6 - 12, 13]. Based on the experiences of the utilization of the standard (10 % of the territory of Hungary covered by standardized database, approx. 800 000 hectares), FÖMI has developed a software (DATR) for the integrated cadastral <b>map</b> and <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> data management. [3] The base idea of the development was to build-up a software, which provides a flexible, authentic and integrated management of cadastral <b>map</b> data and <b>land</b> <b>registry.</b> DATR is not a real GIS system, this software solution is able to manage any map data with the related <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> data. Cadastral <b>map</b> and <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> data are stored in the same database with the enforced integrity of them. Change management are only available via database transactions, therefore DATR has no map editing capacity. By this method we can enforce the authenticity of the two types of data (<b>map</b> and <b>land</b> <b>registry).</b> DATR is using an object-oriented database scheme, therefore the monitoring and management of business procedure is very flexible. DATR is using open APIs, therefore customization of the system, the business rules and procedures is very easy and flexible. DATR has certified its productivity in real life, since it is the graphic engine of Internet-based Hungarian <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> data service (TAKARNET).

40|$|Recent anecdotal {{evidence}} from property professionals {{indicates that there}} has been a significant increase in boundary disputes in Ireland since the phased publication of the <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> digital <b>map</b> in 2005. There is a need to investigate this development in order to confirm or refute this trend and attempt to identify the issues causing these disputes. There is an absence of detailed information on the causes and types of boundary disputes within the Irish Legal system. This project aims to address this lack of information by collecting comprehensive information on a range of case studies over the past 5 years and determine the incidence of these types of disputes. The cost to all parties to these disputes will also be estimated to inform policy makers of the effectiveness of the current system. An electronic questionnaire on boundaries in general, was carried out to gauge the perception and context in which property boundaries are perceived in Ireland by landowners. Initial results from this first questionnaire show that 32 % and 38 % of landowners in urban and rural areas respectively have issues with their boundaries, and 22 % of landowners did not know whether their property is registered in <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> or in Registry of Deeds. A second questionnaire, currently in progress, intends collecting information on specific boundary dispute cases to determine the issues causing these disputes and identify the various types of disputes within this litigation category.

This includes for ships, aircraft and telecommunications networks. Doing so, Kadaster protects legal certainty. The Kadaster publishes many large authoritative datasets including several key registers of the Dutch Government (Topography, Addresses and Buildings). Furthermore Kadaster is also developing and maintaining the PDOK shared service, in which about 100 spatial datasets are being published in several formats, including {{an incredible amount of}} detailed geospatial objects. Geospatial objects include all plots of land, all buildings, all roads and all lampposts. These objects are spatially and/or conceptually related, but are maintained by different data curators. As a result these datasets are syntactically and architecturally disjoint, and using them together currently requires non-trivial human labor. In response to this, Kadaster is currently publishing its geo-spatial data assets as Linked Open Data. The standardized query language for Linked Open Geodata is GeoSPARQL. Unfortunately, current tooling does not support writing and evaluating GeoSPARQL queries. This paper presents GeoYASGUI, a GeoSPARQL editor and result-set viewer with IDE capabilities.
