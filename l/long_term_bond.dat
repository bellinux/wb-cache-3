50|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} (EPC) is a promiscuous mating behaviour in monogamous species. Monogamy {{occurs when}} one male mates exclusively with one female, forming a <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>bond</b> and combining efforts to raise offspring together; extra-pair copulation occurs {{when one of}} these individuals mates outside of this pairing. Across the animal kingdom, extra-pair copulation is common in monogamous species, and only a very few pair-bonded species {{are thought to be}} exclusively sexually monogamous. EPC in the animal kingdom has mostly been studied in birds and mammals. Possible benefits of EPC can be investigated within non-human species, such as birds. In males, a number of theories are proposed to explain extra-pair copulations. One such hypothesis is that males maximise their reproductive success by copulating with as many females as possible outside of a pair bond relationship because their parental investment is lower, meaning they can copulate and leave the female with minimum risk to themselves. Females, on the other hand, have to invest a lot more in their offspring; extra-pair copulations produce a greater cost because they put the resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship. Despite this, females do seek out extra pair copulations, and, because of the risk, there is more debate about the evolutionary benefits for females.|$|E
5000|$|The 1876 {{courthouse}} {{was built}} in the boom of the county's railroad-logging era. By 1912, when the county began seriously thinking about replacing the old courthouse, most of the best timber had been cut off. The stated reasons for replacing the courthouse revolved around its vault, which was supposed to protect important records. People were aware that when the U.S. Land Office in Eau Claire burned, documents in its supposedly safe vault were destroyed - documents which could not be replaced. Twenty years later, {{one of the members of}} the building committee wrote: [...] The other reason, not publicly discussed but fully considered by some progressive members of the board, was that the courthouse should be built now because the original wealth of Taylor County timber was fast disappearing, thus leaving the financing and payment of the new courthouse to the farmers and the endless slashings.... If the building had been postponed or had the plan for financing the building by <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>bond</b> issue been approved, as it was suggested by some lumbering interests, the farmers and bona fide citizens would have had to pay the bill." [...] The new courthouse was designed by Baldwin Mehner, a son of Dorchester, who had designed the Calumet County Courthouse shortly before. Hutter Construction won the building contract with a $57,203 bid and began building in 1913. The dedication ceremony was September 9, 1914, with fireworks, a $150 prize for best decorated automobile, a $30 prize for best driving horses, and $15 for a tug-of-war contest between the different townships.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies time {{variation}} in expected excess bond returns. We run regressions of annual excess returns on forward rates. We {{find that a}} single factor predicts 1 -year excess returns on 1 - 5 year maturity bonds with an R 2 up to 43 %. The single factor is a tent-shaped linear function of forward rates. The return forecasting factor has a clear business cycle correlation: Expected returns are high in bad times, and low in good times, and the return-forecasting factor forecasts long-run output growth. The return-forecasting factor also forecasts stock returns, suggesting a common time-varying premium for real interest rate risk. The return forecasting factor is poorly related to level, slope, and curvature movements in bond yields. Therefore, it represents a source of yield curve movement not captured by most term structure models. Though the return-forecasting factor {{accounts for more than}} 99 % of the time-{{variation in}} expected excess bond returns, we find additional, very small factors that forecast equally small differences between <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>bond</b> returns, and hence statistically reject a one-factor model for expected returns. ...|$|E

We examine the implications of price and wage rigidities and the existence of a non-interest bearing financial asset used for transactions purposes for the validity of these irrelevance theorems. In general, public financial policies have effects on intergenerational distribution; alternative financial policies have implications for the pattern of capital accumulation (an effect which was the center of the literature on money and growth) and on the sharing of risks among members of different generations. We examine the consequences of three alternative financial policies,a fixed supply of financial assets, a fixed price level, and a fixed real supply of government indebtedness; under some plausible conditions, the latter policy may provide for the least intergenerational variability inconsumption. ...|$|E

Surveys on horse related accidents underline the need for a better knowledge and observation of the behaviour of horses in different situations and professions. The reaction of the horse on human handling depends on the human attitude, skills and experience but also on the horses’ temperament. The development of methods to evaluate the way horses react to humans is rather recent and a variety of approaches have been developed, among them are observer ratings and behavioural tests. Most horse owners develop an emotional bond with their horses. The way owners consider their horse most likely has an important influence on the way they manage and handle them. The horse-rider relationship is only very poorly understood; riding accidents and severe mismatches between horse-rider and aim lead to disappointments and welfare problems.
