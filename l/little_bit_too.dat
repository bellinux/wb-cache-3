[...] Isler was also critical of guest actress Michelle Krusiec's delivery; he noted the performance was [...] "really bland in many spots and she never really achieve a convincing 'femme fatale' vibe." [...] Isler had other critiques of the episode, explaining [...] "Some of the writing/direction is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> off <b>too,</b> and I saw the shapeshifter switcharoo coming a mile away. These aren't major flaws, but they do detract a tiny bit from the story." ...|$|R

Speaking about the collision between Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said: [...] "It's an accident, it's part of the show.

[...] He went on to describe the weekend as [...] "a good lesson" [...] for the team, taking positive things from the race, such as the good race pace shown by both cars. As {{a result of their}} double retirement, both Ferrari drivers lost their respective positions in the Drivers' Championship. While Vettel was overtaken by Rosberg into second place, Räikkönen lost fourth position to Valtteri Bottas. In the Constructors' Standings, Williams moved closer to Ferrari in second place, now trailing them by 131 points. At the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony on 3 December 2015, the organizers were awarded the prize as Best Promoter.|$|E

[...] By contrast, Henry Adaso of About.com coined the collaboration of Jay Z and Knowles on [...] "Hollywood" [...] as the worst one on the entire album.

500|$|Since 1963, the {{perennial}} companion figure in Doctor Who generally serves {{to remind the}} Doctor of his [...] "moral duty". However, Adam {{was never meant to}} be a long-term companion. In the behind-the-scenes book Doctor Who: The Inside Story Davies explains that he [...] "always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubs Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are put in front of him." [...] Davies felt that Adam's story provided [...] "a chance to see someone starting on that path" [...] before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.|$|E
500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play around a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>too.</b> Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E

Noah explained, “I don’t like thin fabric that doesn’t make me look skinnier. Just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> but not <b>too</b> thick cause when it’s too thick then it shows my fat”. Gus made a similar comment that he prefers thicker material because the thin materials, “they expose everything”. Within the same conversations these boys explained that they preferred darker materials because “it won’t show that much” (Jack). Benjamin was adamant about wearing darker colors and said, “No, no, no dark colors only so {{no one can see}} me. I just want to be ignored”.

The study confirmed that teenagers are able to rank personas in order of cool and that the process of using personas can provide valuable insights around the phenomenon of cool.

500|$|Dumped was {{met with}} a mixed {{reaction}} from critics. James Walton, of The Telegraph, was critical of the programme and its purpose; on Darren's departure, he said: [...] "According to the narrator, this proved that Darren “didn’t understand” the experiment. Another interpretation, of course, would be that he did." [...] The Times criticised the programme for setting the programme in an artificial rubbish dump for health and safety reasons, comparing it to various fakery scandals {{that had taken place}} in the programme Blue Peter in the past year. However, Nigel Kendall of the same newspaper called the programme [...] "entertaining" [...] and its contestants [...] "likeable", while Paul Hoggart said that it gets its point across. Website TV Scoop said that the programme was [...] "a great experiment", but did not approve of the inclusion of [...] "fame hungry" [...] participants and compared the programme to the most recent series of Big Brother. The website Hecklerspray gave the programme a negative review, calling the participants [...] "absolute fucking morons", and Orange gave the programme 3 out of 5 stars. Channel 4 controller Julian Bellamy commented on the programme's failure during Edinburgh Television Festival 2008, saying that it [...] "didn't have the human narrative you need" [...] and that it was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> like other reality shows".|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like he went out and told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what?

[...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma.

It was first rumoured in April 2006 that Adrian Lester might not return as Mickey Bricks in the fourth series; the BBC confirmed his departure in September that year, elevating Marc Warren's character to the lead role and casting Ashley Walters as a new member of the group. The BBC was quick to dispel any suggestion that Lester's resignation was connected to the shift in production focus, stating [...] "it is a shame that, due to his current filming commitments, Adrian cannot join us this time round...", while Lester explained his action as [...] "need to do something else, be associated with something else".
