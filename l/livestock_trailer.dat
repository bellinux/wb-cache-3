50|$|The North American roundup was {{an iconic}} {{image of the}} American Old West: the {{gathering}} of cattle in the open range, followed by them being driven vast distances from ranches to distant railheads {{over a period of}} several weeks. Due to the time and distance involved, not only did livestock and cowboys have to endure rough terrain and extreme weather, herds were also at risk from theft, hunger and disease. As railroads expanded, the time and distance travelled became shorter until railroads expanded into most communities, requiring cattle drives of a few days or a couple of weeks at most. Later, as motorised transport for livestock became common, rounded-up animals were often driven to the nearest road, herded into holding corrals, then loaded onto trucks for further transport. The modern American roundup now generally encompasses the gathering of animals from grazing lands in outlying sections of a large private ranch or from public lands leased from the Bureau of Land Management or US Forest Service. This process may still take many days and at times may require cowboys to camp out in remote areas, though most often this will be at a base camp near the holding corrals. The animals are gathered in holding corrals near a developed road, loaded into a <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> or semi-trailer and transported to their ultimate destination.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant and combined glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium disinfectant after a high-pressure wash against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in experimental settings mimicking field conditions commonly experienced on <b>livestock</b> <b>trailers.</b> Materials and methods: Aluminum model <b>livestock</b> <b>trailers</b> (1 : 61) were contaminated with PRRSV- and TGEV-spiked feces. Each model trailer underwent a simple washing procedure and an assigned disinfectant application. Four environmental swabs were collected per trailer at five time points and tested by PRRSV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and TGEV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten-week old pigs were inoculated orally and intramuscularly with supernatant from environmental samples taken from model trailers at two time points after disinfection. Fecal swabs and blood collected at 7 and 14 days post inoculation were tested by PRRSV qPCR and TGEV PCR {{to determine if the}} inoculum had contained live infectious virus. Results: All Positive Control pigs were positive by PRRSV qPCR at 7 and 14 days post inoculation and by PRRSV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at day 14. Pigs in the other treatment groups were negative by PRRSV qPCR and PRRSV ELISA at all time points. Results of TGEV testing were inconclusive because the Positive Control group failed to become infected. Implication: Under study conditions, a high-pressure wash with cold water plus application of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide or a combined glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium disinfectant is effective at inactivating PRRSV...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} and detection of PEDV in the US {{in the spring}} of 2013, the swine industry has witnessed incredibly rapid spread of the virus to sow herds and growing pigs across the geographical US. The swine industry is an 2 Ì† 2 industry on wheels, 2 Ì† 2 with transport of large numbers of swine across the country every day. It is not surprising then, to discover that contaminated livestock trailers {{have played a role in}} the movement of this virus. We cannot quickly change the mobile nature of swine production, but we can identify and implement effective decontamination procedures for contaminated livestock trailers. The body of literature reviewing inactivation of PEDV is very small, but there are a great number of studies that describe inactivation of other, structurally similar, coronaviruses. These studies indicate that several of the typical methods employed for <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> decontamination, e. g. chemical disinfection and exposure to high temperatures, as well as other environmental conditions such as alkaline pH and high relative humidity, or prolonged time at moderate temperatures were all capable of effectively inactivating coronaviruses. Additionally, it was evident that the presence of proteins around the virus (as might be present in feces) decreased the effectiveness of both heat and disinfectant at virus inactivation, and that chemical disinfectants are more effective when applied at higher temperatures. To directly investigate the ability of high temperatures to inactivate PEDV in the context of a <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> and TADD facility, original research was conducted to evaluate multiple temperatures applied to PEDV-contaminated feces on aluminum trays.

50|$|In both {{historical}} and modern times, {{the necessity of}} rounding up cattle from the open range is a job primarily performed by a cowboy mounted on a horse. Historically, the long-distance cattle drives required cattle to first be gathered, then herded over long distances, often requiring several weeks of travel, covering up to 30 mi in a day to bring herds of cattle several hundred miles to a railhead for sale and shipping. Today, though cattle are usually rounded up and herded {{only as far as}} a decent road where they can be loaded onto <b>livestock</b> <b>trailers</b> or semi-trailers, the terrain as well as unpredictable behavior of cattle render motorized vehicles virtually useless for rounding up and herding. Thus, in modern times, the use of horses remains essential.|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated {{differences between}} sheep breeds {{in response to}} supplementary feeding and very close confinement with familiar and unfamiliar sheep; and differences between individuals {{in response to a}} taming procedure prior to transport in a trailer. The first two experiments were with a mixed flock of Clun Forest lambs and crossbred lambs from Orkney. An initial tendency to feed with others of the same breed diminished over 3 weeks. Responses of heart rate and salivary cortisol concentration when one sheep (the visitor) was penned in an enclosure of 1 m 2 with three other sheep of the same or the other breed (the trio group), did not depend on whether the visitor and the trio group were of the same or different breed. Clun Forest sheep showed little response while Orkney sheep showed increased heart rate and some elevation of salivary cortisol concentration. In the third experiment, 34 Beulah Speckled Face ewes were divided into two groups one of which was subjected to a taming procedure over a period of 3 weeks. Response of salivary cortisol concentration to subsequent journeys of 2 h in a <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> did not differ between tamed and untamed sheep. There were individual differences in the response to taming and this was correlated with the cortisol response during transport, in that those sheep which responded most to taming showed the least elevation during transport...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{noise is}} an {{unavoidable}} by-product of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations which, {{in the context}} of design optimization, may lead to challenges in finding optimum designs. This article draws attention to this issue by illustrating the difficulties it can cause for road vehicle aerodynamics simulations. Firstly, a benchmark problem, flow past the Ahmed body, is used to highlight the effect of numerical noise on the calculation of aerodynamic drag. A series of simulations are conducted using three commonly employed Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based turbulence models. Noise amplitudes of up to 22 % are evident and the level of noise depends on the combination of turbulence model and grid used. Overall the Spalart Allmaras model is shown to be the least susceptible to noise levels for this particular application. Secondly, multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimization is applied to a low-drag aerodynamic fairing for a <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer.</b> The fairing is parameterised in terms of three design variables. Moving Least Squares (MLS) metamodels are constructed from 50 high-fidelity CFD solutions for two objective functions. Subsequent optimization is successful for the first objective, however numerical noise levels in excess of 7 % are found to be problematic for the second one. A deliberate revision to the problem reduces the amount of noise present and leads to success with the construction of a small Pareto Front. Further analysis underlines the inherent capability of MLS metamodels in dealing with noisy CFD responses. Suggestions are also made to improve the chances of success for future investigations...|$|E

40|$|Small <b>livestock</b> <b>trailers</b> are {{commonly}} used to transport animals from farms to market within the United Kingdom. Due to the bluff nature of these vehicles there is great potential for reducing drag with a simple add-on fairing. This paper explores the feasibility of combining high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis, accurate metamodeling, and efficient optimization techniques to find an optimum fairing geometry which reduces drag, without significantly impairing internal ventilation. Airflow simulations were carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to assess the performance of each fairing based on three design variables. A Moving Least Squares (MLS) metamodel was built on a fifty-point Optimal Latin Hypercube (OLH) Design of Experiments (DoE), where each point represented a different geometry configuration. Traditional optimization techniques were employed on the metamodel until an optimum geometrical configuration was found. This optimum design was tested using CFD and it matched closely to the metamodel prediction. Further, the drag reduction was measured at 14. 4 % on the trailer and 6. 6 % for the combined truck and trailer. L...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{method of}} reducing aerosolized pathogens and environmental contaminants during commercial transportation could prove {{beneficial to the}} health and value of cattle. Having previously determined that there was very limited airflow within moving <b>livestock</b> <b>trailers,</b> an experimental treatment that increased cross-ventilation within commercial cattle trailers by installing aluminum scoops to punch-hole trailers was evaluated. Environmental factors including temperature, ammonia and carbon dioxide concentrations, and percent dry matter of excreted urine and fecal matter were evaluated, along with physiological factors, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, percent weight loss, the presence of Salmonella, Escherichia coli, or Mannheimia haemolytica, and 30 day health data. The experiment consisted of two trials, each with two truckloads of 80 cattle each, for a total of 320 cattle. Temperature was evaluated in the center compartments of each trailer at five minute intervals throughout both trips. Ammonia concentrations were measured using passive dosimeters. Jugular blood samples, fecal grab samples, swabs of the terminal rectum and nasal swabs were obtained 8. 5 to 10 hours post-transport from 20 cattle from each trailer. Increased ventilation resulted in lower temperatures and ammonia concentrations on both trips. Percent dry matter of excreted urine and fecal matter were inconclusive. There were no treatment effects for complete blood counts or electrolyte and basic chemistry panels, possibly because the cattle had access to both hay and water between transport and sampling, which allowed for recovery. Cattle in the ventilated trailer had an average weight loss of 4. 7 %, compared with 5. 75 % for the cattle in the control trailers. Sampling for E. coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella, and M. haemolytica showed very few positives, likely due to the good condition of the cattle prior to transport. During the 30 days post-transport, no cattle from either treatment required veterinary attention related to transport. The results indicate that increasing ventilation through the use of external air scoops has the potential to improve {{the health and well-being of}} cattle during transport...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{three different}} methods {{which can be}} used to quantify passive ventilation inside small livestock trailers. Accomplishing this is crucial to determine whether animal welfare ventilation standards are met during road transport. High-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted for a detailed <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> containing 48 sheep and coupled to a generic towing vehicle. An initial correlation study shows that the observed airflow patterns share the general flow structure with an equivalent but simplified geometry which has previously been validated. Further analysis of the detailed geometry shows that twice as much air flows through the upper deck of the trailer compared to the lower deck which is due to a tailboard vent allowing easier passage to the low-pressure wake. Ventilation is analysed using the net flow rate through vent openings {{along the side of the}} trailer; it is found to be below the regulatory threshold for vehicle speeds of up to 17. 9 m/s on the lower deck and 8. 9 m/s on the upper one. One drawback of this analysis method is that it does not consider ventilation efficacy within the interior. In order to address this, two additional methods are proposed to identify ventilation rates using (i) passive scalars and (ii) a particle tracking algorithm. The former method suggests that the greatest residence time is 30. 0 s with the latter indicating a value of 19. 5 s; both of these occur in the vicinity of one animal muzzle, in a stagnant airflow region of the lower deck. All three analysis methods are compared to EU-specified regulatory ventilation rates in the form of a ventilation coefficient. Overall, ventilation is shown to be significantly better on the upper deck of the trailer, satisfying current livestock transport regulations at moderate to high vehicle speeds, whereas ventilation is markedly less on the lower deck and potentially below the regulatory threshold...|$|E
40|$|Transporting cattle from {{southern}} Alberta into the United States (US) plays a substantial economic {{role in the}} western Canadian beef industry. Thermal environments within cattle transport trailers are dependent on ambient conditions, and if inadequately managed, can be a welfare concern. To effectively manage cattle transport, the environmental conditions throughout the <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> must be understood. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the trailer micro-climate and welfare during 5 -paired commercial long-haul transports of slaughter cattle from Alberta, Canada to Washington State, US during summer months. In addition, the effect of compartment location and trailer porosity (8. 7 % vs 9. 6 %) on trailer micro-climate, shrink and core body temperature were also investigated during the warmest in-transit hour and stationary events. The compartment location had an effect on micro-climate variables where the upper compartment had greater (P < 0. 05) temperature than the bottom deck compartments and relative humidity variables had the opposite effect for both the warmest in-transit hour and stationary events. There was also an effect of trailer porosity on micro-climate variables where it was generally warmer in the trailer with the higher porosity in the stationary event. Differences between trailers included 2 additional roof hatches on the trailer with lower side-wall porosity and lower internal temperatures, which could suggest the location of the trailer porosity, could be important for heat and moisture exchange during transit. The nose of the trailer with higher porosity had generally warmer internal conditions (larger T(trailer) Â°C and THI(trailer)) than the trailer with lower porosity. This study also found that the temperatures inside the trailer can be 10. 5 Â°C greater than ambient temperatures during stationary events and 9 Â°C greater than ambient levels during the warmest in-transit hour. The average amount of per-animal weight loss was 4. 3 0. 3 % and was affected by trailer porosity and compartment, which followed the trends in thermal environment variables. The transit status (stationary or in-transit) and trailer porosity affected the vaginal core body temperature of the heifers in transit. The core body temperature was greater during stationary events for animals transported in the trailer with lower porosity. It is suggested that the lower side-wall porosity and/or the shape of perforation pattern could impair the movement of fresh air to the respiratory tract of heifers, thus impacting the main mechanism for dissipating heat. The difference in temperature from the trailer ceiling to the animal level was 3. 38 Â°C in the trailer with lower porosity (cooler at the ceiling) and 2. 23 Â°C in the trailer with the higher porosity. This relationship also had a compartment location effect that followed the micro-climate compartmental differences. This could suggest that excess heat in the trailer with the lower porosity, that also had lower overall temperatures, exited through roof hatches, while in the trailer with the higher porosity, the heat escaped through the side-wall perforations. This theory also supports the idea that the location of where the porosity is located on the trailer may be important to alleviating heat stress in summer months during transport. The results of this study also indicated that there was no difference in the location of the data logger plane (driver, middle passenger) and within the compartments (front, middle, back), suggesting that compartment location effect is substantial when considering micro-climate but temperatures within a compartment are mostly homogenous. The trip that had average ambient temperatures of 25. 9 Â± 6. 06 Â°C for the entire journey, had a temperature Humidity Index that was considered in the danger or emergency category according to the Livestock Weather Heat Index during 95 % of the warmest in-transit hour. This suggests that during ambient temperatures of 25. 9 Â°C, both trailers used in this study did not have sufficient heat exchange to mitigate the risk of heat stress for cattle...|$|E
40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is a small, non-enveloped, circular, single {{stranded}} DNA virus {{of economic}} {{importance in the}} swine industry worldwide.

Results of the first study indicated that evaluated ELISAs had area under the receiver operating curve values greater than 0. 94, detected both anti-PCV 2 a and - 2 b antibodies with no differentiation, and did cross react with anti-PCV 1 antibodies in infected animals. The second study determined that PCV 2 exposure (natural or experimental) results in a chronic infection and PCV 2 is shed in similar amounts by nasal, oral and fecal routes. In addition, PCV 2 DNA present in excretions, secretions or on mechanical vectors is infectious to nayve pigs and therefore important for PCV 2 transmission. The third study determined that although PCV 2 DNA was detected on trailer surfaces by PCR following three different disinfection protocols, PCV 2 was not transmitted to nayve animals exposed to the contaminated trailers. The fourth study provided direct evidence that an experimental spray-drying process was not effective in inactivating PCV 2 and it is therefore possible that spray-dried porcine plasma from pigs could represent a biosecurity risk for the industry. The final study showed that the combination of a multistep disinfection protocol with an improved, strict biosecurity plan can result in establishment of a PCV 2 nayve herd and this status can be maintained for up to 10 months (300 days) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{synthetically}} produced pheromone (PAP) on the well-being of pigs during transport to the slaughter house Even though numerous attempts to reduce stress during the transport of slaughter pigs, the losses due to transportation induced stress are between 0. 03 % and 0. 5 % in the EU and 0. 4 % in Germany. PSE is seen in 10 to 20 % of the animals. A naturally occurring pheromone is secreted by the mammary glands of the sow, which have a calming and stress reducing effect on the piglets {{as well as on}} adult pigs. In this placebo controlled double blind study, the possible stress and aggression reducing potential of the synthetically produced `Porcine Appeasing Pheromone (PAP) Â´ (SSNA Sanofi SantÃ© Nutrition Animale) was examined in slaughter pigs during their transport to the slaughter house and the possibility of improved meat quality. Eleven groups, each containing 24 pigs (n= 264 Pigs; Breed Pi x DL) weighing 102 Â± 10. 6 kg were observed. Each group was transported in a <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer,</b> traveling the same route with the same driver for 40 to 45 minutes from the finishing barn to the slaughterhouse. Before and after the pigs were transported, a number of parameters were recorded. For the experiment, 6 ml of the PAP was sprayed along {{the back of the neck}} in five of the groups (n= 150 pigs) while in the other six groups (n= 144 pigs) a placebo was applied the same way. The cortisol level in the saliva of the live animals was determined in eight animals of each group (1. base level at the finishing barn, 2. after transport, 3. 30 minutes after arriving at the slaughter house in a holding pen). The animalsâ€˜ behavior was also observed using video surveillance in the holding pen for 25 minutes (scan sampling every 30 seconds). The heart rates of eight animals per group were recorded using a PolarÂ® sport tester; the surface body temperature was measured using infrared thermography and the animals were weighed. Post mortem, the pH 1 and pH 24, the ability to conduct in the ham and in the chops were determined and the carcasses were examined for injuries due to fighting. In addition, the air humidity and ambient air temperature on the outside and inside of the <b>livestock</b> <b>trailer</b> was measured. The results show a definite stress- or transport-induced activation of the Hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis (HPA) in all animals. A significant increase of the cortisol levels were evident in the saliva samples taken from all the pigs after transport versus the base level samples taken in the finishing barn. The animals treated with the pheromone had a significantly lower saliva cortisol concentration (p= 0. 02) compared to the pigs who were given the placebo (placebo 22. 55 Â± 6, 4 nmol/l, pheromone 19, 15 Â± 7, 26 nmol/l). Analyzing the heart rates revealed no significant difference between the two groups. The highest heart rates were reached during loading (170 - 173 bpm) and the rate slowly decreased to 118 - 120 bpm while in the holding pen. The severe strain the animals are under becomes evident when one looks at the high heart rates. The body temperature taken at the base of the ear also showed no significant difference between the control and PAP group. The base temperature, although dependent on the ambient air temperature and weather conditions, remained steady in its increase during transport on cold or warm days (4. 5 Â± 2. 5 Â°C on cold and 4. 6 Â± 1. 9 Â°C on warm days). Even the parameters weight loss and behavior showed no differences between the PAP group and the control group. The carcasses had few minor injuries, which were evenly spread between both groups. This can be attributed to the fact that the groups were transported individually by pens without mixing unfamiliar animals. On the other hand, the measurement pertaining to the quality of the meat did show a possible influence by the application of the PAP. The pH 1 in the longissimus dorsi muscle of the pheromone treated pigs is significantly higher 45 minutes after slaughter (p< 0, 01; placebo pH 1 = 6, 13 Â± 0, 22; pheromone pH 1 = 6, 26 Â± 0, 29) as well as the conductivity of the same muscle is significantly lower 24 hours post mortem (p< 0. 01; placebo conductivity= 7. 22 Â± 2. 39; pheromone conductivity= 6. 32 Â± 1. 83). An improvement in meat quality is also seen in the PAP-treated animals, which is based on defined meat properties for quality control. The placebo group had a higher percentage of animals under suspicion of having PSE or DFD meat. At the same time, greater carcass meat values and quality ratings of very good and good were seen in the PAP-treated pigs. The results of this study seem to point in the direction that `Porcine Appeasing PheromoneÂ´ influences the physiological and physical state of pigs during transport in form of a stress reducer. This stress reducing effect is recognizable in the significantly lower saliva cortisol levels of the PAP animals after transport. A possible calming effect of PAP is probably not significant based on this data. Additionally, the stress reducing effect of the `Porcine Appeasing PheromoneÂ´ leads to a reduced glycogenolysis in the muscle tissue and with that a lower muscle acidity which leads to a significantly higher pH 1 and a significantly lower conductivity of the longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of PAP, based on the results of this study, is an acceptable method to improve the well being of the pigs during transport, to reduce stress and additionally improve the quality of the meat. Further study is needed to examine and modify the duration and place (holding pen, room spray) of the PAP application. Trotz zahlreicher Versuche die Belastungen waehrend des Transportes von Schlachtschweinen zu reduzieren, liegen die Verluste auf Grund des Transportstresses in der EU bei 0, 03 bis 0, 5 % und in Deutschland bei 0, 4 % verstorbener Tiere sowie bei einer PSE-Rate von 10 bis 20 %. Natuerlicherweise wird von der Muttersau ueber Druesen der Gesaeugeleiste ein Pheromon sezerniert, welches einen beruhigenden und stressreduzierenden Effekt auf Ferkel aber auch adulte Tiere hat. In dieser Placebokontrollierten DoppelblindStudie sollte eine moegliche stress- und aggressionsreduzierende Wirkung des synthetisch ergestellten "porcine appeasing pheromone (PAP) " (SSNA Sanofi SantÃ© Nutrition Animale) bei Schlachtschweinen waehrend des Transportes sowie dadurch bedingt eine moegliche Verbesserung der Fleischqualitaet geprueft werden. Die Beobachtungen erfolgten an 11 Gruppen von jeweils 24 Schweinen (n = 264 Schweine der Rasse Pi x DL) mit einem Koerpergewicht von 102 Â± 10, 6 kg. Jede Gruppe wurde in einem Tiertransporter auf jeweils der gleichen Route mit dem gleichen Fahrer fuer ca. 40 bis 45 Minuten vom Maester zum Schlachthof transportiert. Vor und nach dem Transport wurden verschiedene Parameter erhoben. Fuer den Versuch erhielten 5 Gruppen (n = 120 Tiere) vor dem Transport 6 ml des PAPâ€™s als Spray auf die Nackenhaut und 6 Gruppen (n = 144 Tiere) erhielten an der gleichen Stelle ein Placebo. Am lebenden Tier wurde Cortisol im Speichel bei 8 Tieren/Gruppe bestimmt (1. Basalwert beim Maester, 2. nach dem Transport, 3. 30 Minuten nach Ankunft im Schlachthof in der Wartebucht). Weiterhin erfolgten Verhaltensbeobachtungen mittels Video in der Wartebucht fuer 25 Minuten (scan-sampling alle 30 sec), es wurde die Herzfrequenz mittels PolarÂ® Sport Tester bei 8 Tieren/Gruppe gemessen und die Koerperoberflaechentemperatur mittels Infrarot-Thermometrie sowie das Koerpergewicht bestimmt. Post mortem wurde der pH 1 und pH 24, die Leitfaehigkeit im Schinken und im Kotelett 24 h nach der Schlachtung bestimmt und der Schlachtkoerper auf Verletzungen auf Grund von Auseinandersetzungen untersucht. Zusaetzlich wurden ausserhalb und im Transporter Luftfeuchte und Umgebungstemperatur bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse weisen auf eine deutliche stressor- bzw. transportinduzierte Aktivierung der Hypothalamus-Hypophysen-Nebennieren-Achse (HPA) bei allen Tieren. Im Speichel von allen Schweinen ist ein eindeutiger Anstieg der Cortisolkonzentration nach dem Transport im Vergleich zum Basalwert messbar, wobei die mit dem Pheromon behandelten Tiere eine signifikant niedrigere Cortisolkonzentration (p = 0, 02) im Speichel aufwiesen, im Vergleich zu den mit Placebo behandelten Tieren (Placebo 22, 55 Â± 6, 4 nmol/l, Pheromon 19, 15 Â± 7, 26 nmol/l). Die Auswertung der Herzfrequenzmessungen jedoch ergab keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen den zwei Versuchsgruppen. Die hoechsten Werte konnten beim Verladen gemessen werden (170 - 173 S/min.), anschliessend ging die Frequenz allmaehlich zurueck bis sie im zweiten Abschnitt des Wartestallaufenthaltes durchschnittlich einen Wert von 118 - 120 S/min. erreichte. Die hohen Werte lassen auf eine starke Belastung der Tiere schliessen. Die Erhebung der Hauttemperatur am Ohrgrund ergab ebenfalls keinen Unterschied zwischen der Kontrollgruppe und der PAP-Gruppe. Die Ausgangstemperatur war zwar von der Umgebungstemperatur und somit vom Wetter abhaengig, dennoch blieb der Anstieg der Temperatur beim Transport bei kalter sowie warmer Witterung nahezu gleich (4, 5 Â± 2, 5 Â°C an kalten und 4, 6 Â± 1, 9 Â°C an warmen Tagen). Auch bei den Parametern Gewichtsverlust und Verhalten konnte kein Unterschied zwischen den PAP- und Kontrollgruppen festgestellt werden. An den Schlachtkoerpern waren nur wenige leichte Verletzungen zu erkennen, die sich auf beide Gruppen gleich verteilten. Dies kann darauf zurueckgefuehrt werden, dass die Tiere buchtenweise, ohne Vermischen der Gruppen transportiert wurden. Hingegen kann bei den Fleischqualitaetsmerkmalen ein vermutlicher Einfluss der PAP-Applikation festgestellt werden. Der pH 1 im M. longissimus dorsi der Pheromon-Tiere ist 45 Minuten nach der Schlachtung signifikant hoeher (p < 0, 01; Placebo pH 1 = 6, 13 Â± 0, 22; Pheromon pH 1 = 6, 26 Â± 0, 29) sowie die Leitfaehigkeit im M. longissimus dorsi 24 h post mortem signifikant niedriger (p < 0, 01; Placebo LF = 7, 22 Â± 2, 39 mS/cm; Pheromon LF= 6, 32 Â± 1, 83 mS/cm). Auch die Bildung von Qualitaetsklassen anhand der Fleischbeschaffenheitsmerkmale deuten auf eine Verbesserung der Fleischqualit aet durch die Applikation von PAP. Bei den Placebogruppen konnte ein prozentual hoeheren Anteil von Schlachtkoerpern in den Klassen "PSE-Verdacht" und "DFD-Verdacht" ermittelt werden. Gleichermassen gab es einen hoeheren Schlachtkoerperanteil in den Klassen "sehr gut" und "gut" bei der PAP-Gruppe. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass das "porcine appeasing pheromone" den physiologischen und koerperlichen Status von Schweinen waehrend des Transportes im Sinne einer Stressreduktion beeinflusst. Dieser stressreduziernde Effekt ist an den signifikant niedrigeren Cortisolkonzentrationen im Speichel der PAP-Tiere nach dem Transport erkennbar. Ob PAP auch einen beruhigenden Effekt hat, ist an Hand vorliegender Ergebnisse eher auszuschliessen. Weiterhin fuehrt die stressreduzierende Wirkung des "porcine appeasing pheromone" zu einer reduzierten Glycogenolyse im Muskel und damit einer verminderten Muskelsaeuerung, welches sich in dem signifikant hoeheren pH 1 und der signifikant niedrigeren Leitfaehigkeit im M. longissimus dorsi ausdrueckt. Die Anwendung von PAP ist an Hand vorliegender Ergebnisse geeignet das Wohlbefinden der Schweine waehrend des Transportes zu verbessern, den Stress zu reduzieren und zusaetzlich dadurch die Fleischqualitaet der Schlachtkoerper zu verbessern. In weiteren Untersuchungen sollten Modifikationen hinsichtlich der Applikationsdauer und der Applikationsorte (Wartebucht, Raumspray) untersucht werden...|$|E
