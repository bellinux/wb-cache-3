5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly <b>loud</b> <b>noises</b> from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{is described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a vibration) with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (such as a <b>loud</b> <b>noise)</b> to evoke a conditioned response (CR) (agitation). In this pairing, the vibration will be presented immediately followed by a <b>loud</b> <b>noise.</b> Initially, {{the presentation of the}} <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> (US) would cause the unconditioned response (UR) (natural agitation) without prior classical conditioning. However, the continuous pairing of the <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> (US) with the vibration (CS) converts the unconditioned response (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a vibration will be followed by a <b>loud</b> <b>noise.</b> Eventually, the fetus will respond to the vibration (CS) without being exposed to the <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the vibration (CS) with the <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|R
40|$|The acute {{toxicity}} induced by 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine appears as rabdomyolysis involving the myocardium (myocytolysis) {{and it is}} often suspected {{to be responsible for}} sudden death. In line with this, cardiac symptoms such as tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmia are present in persons abusing ecstasy. In most cases, ecstasy is abused in <b>loud</b> <b>noise,</b> which in itself might affect the myocardium. To our knowledge no study has investigated the concomitant exposure to ecstasy and <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> in order to evaluate the role of the <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> in modulating MDMA toxicity. In the present study, we analyzed whether cardiac effects following a typical "binging" pattern of MDMA administration are enhanced by concomitant exposure to <b>loud</b> <b>noise.</b> Our findings did not show any myocardial lesion detectable under light microscopy.

40|$|Exposure to {{occupational}} <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> {{has been}} previously identified as a possible risk factor for acoustic neuroma in only one relatively small (n 86 cases) case-control study of men. The goal {{of the present study}} was to further examine the role of <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> in acoustic neuroma etiology. In their population-based case-control study of both sexes conducted from 1999 to 2002 in Sweden, the authors compared reports on type and duration of occupational and nonoccupational <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure of 146 acoustic neuroma cases and 564 controls. Controls were ran-domly selected from the study base and were frequency matched on age, sex, and residential area. The authors found that individuals reporting <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure from any source were at increased risk for acoustic neuroma (odds ratio (OR) 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 2. 30). Exposure to <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> from machines, power tools, and/or construction increased the risk for acoustic neuroma (OR 1. 79, 95 %CI: 1. 11, 2. 89), as did exposure to loud music (OR 2. 25, 95 %CI: 1. 20, 4. 23). The odds ratio for a latency period of 13 or more years since the first <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure from any source was 2. 12 (95 % CI: 1. 40, 3. 20).

5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create <b>loud</b> <b>noises.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from <b>loud</b> <b>noises)</b> or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E

Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years.

Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any <b>loud</b> <b>noises</b> or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse. The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} no reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the <b>loud</b> <b>noises</b> caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> {{is a major}} {{environmental}} thread to public health. <b>Loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure, apart from affecting the inner ear, is deleterious for cardiovascular, endocrine and nervous systems and it is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study we investigated DNA, neurotransmitters and immune- histochemical alterations induced by exposure to <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> in three major brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum) of Wistar rats. Rats were exposed to <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> (100 dBA) for 12 h. The effects of noise on DNA integrity in all three brain areas were evaluated by using Comet assay. In parallel studies, brain monoamine levels and morphology of nigrostriatal pathways, hippocampus and cerebellum were analyzed at different time intervals (24 h and 7 days) after <b>noise</b> exposure. <b>Loud</b> <b>noise</b> produced a sudden increase in DNA damage in all the brain areas under investigation. Monoamine levels detected at 7 days following exposure were differently affected depending on the specific brain area. Namely, striatal but not hippocampal dopamine significantly decreased, whereas hippocampal and cerebellar noradrenaline was significantly reduced. This {{is in line with}} pathological findings within striatum and hippocampus consisting of a decrease in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase combined with increased Bax and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein. <b>Loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure lasting 12 h causes immediate DNA, and long-lasting neurotransmitter and immune-histochemical alterations within specific brain areas of the rat.

40|$|Early {{toxicity}} occurring {{during or}} immediately after 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or "ecstasy") {{administration has not}} been investigated in detail, although in humans it is responsible for marked side effects, and even death. Acute toxicity induced by MDMA produces rhabdomyolysis involving the myocardium (myocytolysis). Cardiac symptoms, such as tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmia, are present to a variable extent in humans abusing ecstasy. In most cases, this substance is abused {{in the presence of}} <b>loud</b> <b>noise,</b> which may affect the myocardium. Despite the frequency of the concomitant exposure to ecstasy and <b>loud</b> <b>noise,</b> and the similarities between the early side effects of these two agents, to our knowledge no study has investigated the role of <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> in modulating MDMA toxicity. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated whether cardiac effects of MDMA administration following a typical "binging" pattern are enhanced by concomitant exposure to <b>loud</b> <b>noise.</b> We selected low doses of MDMA in order to avoid gross morphological alterations, or lesions detectable under light microscopy. The myocardial alterations observed were visible only at the ultrastructural level. We found a dramatic enhancement of alterations in the mouse heart upon MDMA administration during <b>loud</b> <b>noise</b> exposure. Remarkably, this enhancement was evident both as a decrease in the threshold dose of MDMA necessary to alter the myocardial ultrastructure, and as an increase in myocardial alterations produced by a higher dose of MDMA...|$|R
