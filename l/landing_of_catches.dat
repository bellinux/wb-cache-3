Below 34 °N the coastline takes on a more east–west orientation, creating a recognized biogeographical break in the coastline at Point Conception (Fig. 1). It is at Point Conception that the colder California Current from the north and the warmer California Countercur-rent from the south meet. Although there are some cosmopolitan bottom-associated species, such as some rockfish and cabezon, for the most part, the composition of commercially targeted fish species differs greatly north and south of Point Concep-tion. The part of the state north of Point Concep-tion is referred to here as “northern California”, and the part to the south, “southern California”. Since its emergence in the late 1980 s, California’s live fish commercial fishery continues to make up a small but significant portion of the state’s total com-mercial finfish catch. Live landed commercial fish-ing evolved from the demand for specialty foods in Asian restaurants and markets in southern Califor-nia (McKee 1993). What started out as an alterna-tive fishery quickly expanded into a multimillion dollar industry by the early 1990 s (Table 1). Part of the reason for this boom was the willingness of con-sumers to pay a much higher price for live fish than dead fish of certain species, particularly plate-sized fish. That premium was passed on to fishermen in the form of higher ex-vessel prices (price per unit of weight paid to fishermen upon <b>landing</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch)</b> for live fish.

Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur...|$|R

40|$|Recreational fishing as {{a tourist}} {{activity}} has become an increasingly {{important part of the}} Norwegian travel industry and may contribute significantly to the fishing mortality on Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua). Quantifying catches in the tourist fishery is made difficult by Norway's intricate and long coastline, and the lack of a fishing licence system, a registry of businesses catering for fishing tourists, and a registry of charter boats. A probability-based survey was used to estimate annual catch and effort by boat for anglers associated with 445 tourist-fishing businesses during 2009. From a stratified random sample of businesses, fishing tourists were recruited systematically over time to record their daily catch and effort in diaries. Cod dominated the reported <b>landed</b> <b>catch</b> (harvest) north <b>of</b> 62 °N, and saithe and mackerel dominated south of 62 °N.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{present study}} compares human <b>landing</b> <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> primary malaria vectors with two {{alternative}} methods of capture: the Shannon trap and the Mosquito magnet. METHODS: This study used regression models to adjust capture data to a negative binominal distribution. RESULTS: Capture numbers and relative percentages {{obtained from the}} three methods vary strongly between species. The highest overall captures were obtained for Anopheles triannulatus with captures for the Shannon trap and the Mosquito magnet measuring more than 330 % higher than captures obtained by human landings. For Anopheles darlingi, captures by the Shannon trap and the Mosquito magnet were about 14 % and 26 % <b>of</b> human <b>landing</b> <b>catches,</b> respectively. Another species with malaria transmission potential that was not sampled by human landing captures weascaptured by the Shannon trap and the Mosquito magnet (Anopheles oswaldoi). Both alternative sampling techniques can predict the human <b>landing</b> <b>of</b> Anopheles triannulatus, but without proportionality. Models for Anopheles darlingi counts, after totaling daily captures, are significant and proportional, but prediction models are more reliable when using the Shannon trap compared with the Mosquito magnet captures.

In our model, positively size-dependent pricing clearly shifts optimal harvest strategies towards lower harvest rates and higher mean body size of caught fish. The results are relatively insensitive to biological (e. g., natural mortality) and economic details of the model (e. g., discount rate or demand function). These findings show that size-dependent pricing influences optimal harvest strategies aiming at maximum economic yield, and hence, require more attention in resource economics and in fisheries management.

40|$|A Landing Obligation (LO), or a {{requirement}} to <b>land</b> all <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> certain fish species, was introduced {{as part of}} the EU’s new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2014. This DiscardLess policy brief focuses on initial experiences with LO implementation in the Baltic and Pelagic fisheries. It summarises the discard plans in these fisheries, presents stakeholder experiences from interviews, meeting attendance and literature review and highlights emerging issues relevant to all fisheries where the LO is being implemented. Background and main elements <b>of</b> the <b>landing</b> obligation. In March 2007, the Commission published a communication recognising the serious problem of discarding in European fisheries. A public consultation was held and discarding was subsequently highlighted in the Commission’s Green Paper on CFP reform. While a discard ban received significant support, industry recommended instead that discard reduction should be planned, on a fisheries basis, through creating incentives to enhance selectivity. An incident involving a UK trawler in Norwegian waters in 2008 generated public pressure to end discarding, which increased from August 2010 in response to a UK celebrity chef’s public campaign known as “Hugh’s Fish Fight”. In 2011 the Commission included an obligation to <b>land</b> <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> regulated species in its CFP reform proposal. The adopted CFP included a LO, which applied for Baltic and pelagic fisheries from January 2015. The main elements of the LO are as follows: Scope: The LO applies to all <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> species which are subjected to Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits or, in the Mediterranean, to a minimum landing size (MLS). Species that are not subject to TACs or MLS can still be discarded. Minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) : The LO requires that fish under the MCRS are landed but prohibits their use for direct human consumption. <b>Catches</b> <b>of</b> all fish, including fish below the MCRS must be recorded and counted against quotas. Exemptions: The LO does not apply to species and fisheries with demonstrably high survival rates for discarded fish. Also up to 5 % <b>of</b> the total <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> species may be discarded in cases where selectivity increases are difficult to achieve or where handling <b>of</b> unwanted <b>catches</b> creates disproportionate costs (de minimis exemptions). Discard plans: In the absence of multiannual plans groups of member states organised at a regional level develop discard plans in consultation with advisory councils. These plans are submitted as “joint recommendations”, which detail the species {{to be included in the}} LO, at which times and also any exemptions. Following review of the joint recommendations by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) the plans are adopted by the European Commission either in full or with amendments. Quota flexibility The LO requires that fishermen have access to quotas to cover their catches or they have to cease fishing (see “choke species problem” below). Accordingly, there are rules that allow for conditional transfer of quota between years and between species...|$|R

To evaluate this assumption, we compared industry-generated reports <b>of</b> <b>landed</b> <b>catch</b> to independent observer estimates. An observer sampling design for shore-based processing plants was developed and implemented at four plants in Kodiak, Alaska. A total of 13 deliveries from three fisheries were examined. Observers were able to track different portions <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> and treat them as strata from which to randomly sample or completely enumerate. Differences between observer- and industry-derived species proportions were negligible when measured across the entire study, but differed by fishery. Industry weight in the shallow-water flatfish fishery exhibited a small negative bias not related to processor or species type. Weight differences in complete enumerations for big (Beringraja binoculata) and longnose skates (Raja rhina) were of similar magnitude but in opposite directions, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the identification of these species is confused since there is no detection error. Where observers needed to sample, they were able to detect most species in open access fisheries, with a resolution comparable to that of the industry, and were more likely to detect skates than industry. However, in the cooperative rockfish fishery, where tighter controls on the dockside sorting of fish by plant staff are in place, industry reports had enhanced detection of rare species relative to observer sampling. Notwithstanding, differences between data sources remained substantial in strata where the observer sampled even after considering rarity. The results here highlight the utility of using third-party verification to improve data quality of self-reported data, and identified the logistical, database, and analytical challenges to effectively monitor fishery quotas...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that body {{weight of fish}} is {{a key factor in}} determining market value <b>of</b> <b>landed</b> <b>catch,</b> thus influencing optimal harvest strategies. However, in management strategy evaluations and bioeconomic modelling body size is often an overlooked economic parameter, and there are no systematic studies on prevalence of size-dependent pricing. Here we assess the presence and magnitude of size-dependent pricing in ex-vessel prices of fish in Norwegian fisheries. The data encompass landings of four pelagic and four demersal stocks in Norway in 2000 - 2010. Linear mixed models and generalized additive models were used to determine the dependence of unit price on weight class as well as on total yield and time (year). The results show a significant positive relationship between weight class and price for seven out of the eight examined fish stocks. The relative effect of body weight on price was the strongest for cod, Greenland halibut, Norwegian spring-spawning herring and mackerel, lesser for North Sea herring and saithe, and negligible for horse mackerel. These findings demonstrate that size-dependent pricing is common in Norwegian fisheries, and is therefore of high relevance for resource economics and fisheries management...|$|R
