5|$|Kevin's code is {{revealed}} {{to be part of}} a Defense Department satellite transmission. NSA agents ransack the Morris household, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> other documentation that might supposedly compromise national security. After the Morrises are taken into custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating the presence of a massive heat source. Upon encountering some white wolves, Mulder and Scully find Greg Randall's body in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the misalignment of the calendar, an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

50|$|In a {{critical}} trauma incident, {{more than one}} provider is needed {{to be available to}} perform an assessment on one patient. After the initial assessment, one of the providers checks vital signs and <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> information about the patient's medical history. Other providers work on physically examining the patient to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> life threats or other problems that can be fixed while en route to the hospital. A rapid head-to-toe exam is performed to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, burns, tenderness, swelling, and lacerations. If none of these are life-threats, they are ignored on scene and then begin immobilizing the patient on a long spine board.|$|R

25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} to illegally press American sailors into the Royal Navy; an estimated 10,000 sailors between 1799 and 1812. In 1807, in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, [...] demanded that [...] submit to an inspection, ostensibly looking for British citizens {{but in reality}} <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> suitable sailors to press into the Royal Navy. Leopard severely damaged Chesapeake when she refused. The most violent of many such encounters, the affair further fueled the tensions and in June 1812 the U.S. declared war on Britain.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of December 8, British generals and {{engineers}} once again studied the American positions, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> advantage they could exploit in the American defenses. [...] To the astonishment of both the British and the Americans, Howe decided to withdraw and return to Philadelphia. Despite being successful in two major skirmishes over the previous days, his maneuvering had not gotten as far around the American flank as he had hoped and his troops' provisions were running low. Also, the nights were getting colder and the troops had left their tentage and gear in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{five members}} of the Indonesian Journalists' Association (Perhimpunan Wartawan Indonesia, or PWI) formed a fact-finding team on 14 August under the {{leadership}} of Putut Wiryawan and Asril Sutan. The team read the articles written by Udin in the previous six months, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> coverage which could have led to the attack; they concluded that most of his articles could have been a trigger. The committee eventually focused on the bribery allegations against Sudarmo, as those were the only ones exclusively covered in Bernas, as well as a case of election rigging. Another team, from Bernas, known as the [...] "White Kijang" [...] team for the type of car they drove, investigated the case independently when the PWI team failed to share the information they had gathered.|$|E

The Los Angeles Times reported that among the dead were 13 civilian and military managers, engineers and technicians assigned to the American ballistic missile program. [...] Articles in the Las Vegas Review-Journal commemorating the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the crash reported that the FBI search went beyond fingerprint matching for identification; the agents were also <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> surviving sensitive papers relating to national security that the group of military contractors had carried on board in handcuffed briefcases. The same reports also said the crash prompted the military and defense industry to adopt rules to keep groups of technical people involved in the same critical project from traveling together on the same plane.|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, the University of Chicago's admissions {{department}} {{received a}} package {{in the mail}} addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones' full name. The address on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home of the university's geology and geography department. Inside the manila envelope was a detailed replica journal {{similar to the one}} Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of Marion Ravenwood. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on eBay. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, {{which turned out to be}} fake. All contents were from a Guam [...] "prop replicator" [...] who sells them all over the world. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the Oriental Institute.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists. Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.|$|E
