5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to <b>liquid</b> <b>phase.</b> In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in <b>liquid</b> <b>phase.</b> Usually, obtaining the iron in <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|As many {{as eight}} {{immiscible}} <b>liquid</b> <b>phases</b> have been observed. Mutually immiscible <b>liquid</b> <b>phases</b> are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus.

5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic <b>liquid</b> <b>phase.</b> Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in the <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> {{than the}} solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water.

5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic <b>liquid</b> <b>phase.</b> At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E

This budding process is preceded by a complete to partial wetting transition of one of the <b>liquid</b> <b>phases</b> on the membrane and depends on the membrane tensions and the tension of the interface between the enclosed <b>liquid</b> <b>phases.</b> These tensions dominate in different morphology regimes, the crossover of which initiates the budding process. In addition, the degree of budding can be controlled by aspiration via micropipets.

5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the <b>liquid</b> <b>phase).</b> Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel and oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel and oxygen rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel and oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} age of the universe of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the <b>liquid</b> <b>phase.</b> Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
