5000|$|Pancit Malabon is a Filipino {{dish that}} {{is a type of}} pancit, or stir-fried noodle dish, which {{originated}} in Malabon City, Metro Manila, Philippines.

50|$|There {{are several}} methods of cooking a country ham {{including}} slicing and pan-frying, baking whole, and simmering {{for several hours}} (in several changes of water). Whole hams {{may need to be}} scrubbed and soaked for several hours before eating to remove the salt cure and mold. Even when soaked, they are still quite salty. For traditionalists, part of the appeal of country ham is this highly salty taste. Some eaters of country ham scrub, scrape, or pare off the outer crust of curatives, slice it, pan fry it, and eat it as is. Or they may fry the ham with the crust on. Some discard the crust; others consume it along with the meat. Traditionalists, when frying the ham, will typically only place it in a pan long enough to <b>lightly</b> <b>brown</b> it on both sides and to warm the meat. Frying times as short as thirty seconds per side are not uncommon.|$|R

50|$|When making buko pie {{a double}} baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling {{need to be}} {{prepared}} separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked and set aside to cool. Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is <b>lightly</b> <b>browned.</b>|$|E
50|$|TO FRY FISH - Most of {{the smaller}} fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and slice the body {{crosswise}} into five or six pieces; {{season with salt and}} pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs trout and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lardor drippings; fry slowly, turning when <b>lightly</b> <b>browned.</b> PAN-FISH.Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one way. Fillthe spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite brown and readyto turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off the fat; then invert thepan, and they will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back intothe pan, and when hot slip back the fish. When the other side is brown,drain, turn on a plate as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to besent to the table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, inperfect shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with slices of lemon.|$|E
50|$|When {{the meat}} is <b>lightly</b> <b>browned,</b> {{vegetables}} like potatoes and mealies (maize) are added, along with whatever spices are needed. Water or other liquids {{may or may not}} then be added, depending on the views of the potjie chef. The lid is then closed and the contents left to simmer slowly without stirring. This distinguishes a potjiekos from a stew that is stirred. The aim is that the flavours of the different ingredients mix as little as possible. Although some chefs may permit stirring from time to time (which is highly frowned upon), it does create a stew where all the ingredients tend to blend together and taste similar. This is also the main difference between a stew and potjiekos i.e. in a potjie you do not stir. The reason for this is so that the flavour from the meat at the bottom can flavour all the vegetables above while slow cooking. If your potjie is made properly you should still be able to see and taste all the ingredients separately as well as a delicious whole. Little sauce or water is used, so that cooking is by steam and not boiling in a sauce like a stew; thus the heat must be very low and constant. These are some of the secrets of each cook. A potjie is a social activity, with guests generally engaging in fireside chitchat while the potjie cooks, typically three to six hours.|$|E

40|$|In the Mekong Delta {{region of}} South-Vietnam, wine from purple glutinous rice is {{particularly}} interesting {{because of its}} sherry-like taste and flavour and its attractive brown-red colour. It is manufactured at home or by small cottage industries, using traditional solid-state starters (Men). With the objective of improving the knowledge about the functionality of traditional Men, this study deals with the properties and composition of 29 samples of Vietnamese commercial rice wine starters. We selected 6 rice wine starters for their superior ability to liquefy cooked rice, high ethanol accumulation, and production of attractive flavour and colour in the resulting wine. Ethanol contents reached 12 g/ 100 ml, a sweet alcoholic fragrance was noticed and the wine colour varied from red to <b>lightly</b> <b>brown.</b> Total mould, yeast and bacteria counts in Men were 3. 4 ¿ 6. 0, 5. 8 ¿ 7. 2 and 2. 6 ¿ 6. 2 log CFU/g of dry weight sample, respectively. A total of 119 microbial strains, comprising 53 moulds, 51 yeasts and 15 bacteria, was isolated. Mould isolates with excellent functionality were identified as Amylomyces rouxii, Amylomyces aff. rouxii (an atypical form of A. rouxii), Rhizopus oligosporus and Rhizopus oryzae. Yeast isolates with excellent fermentation properties were all identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae; other, less functional isolates were identified as Candida glabrata and Pichia anomala...|$|R
