An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components. AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion.

25|$|In {{discussing}} {{the evolution of}} S. mutans, {{it is imperative to}} include the role humans have played and the co-evolution that has occurred between the two species. As humans evolved anthropologically, the bacteria evolved biologically. It is widely accepted that the advent of agriculture in early human populations provided the conditions S. mutans needed to evolve into the virulent bacteria it is today. Agriculture introduced fermented foods, as well as more carbohydrate rich foods, into the diets of historic human populations. These new foods introduced new bacteria to the oral cavity and created new environmental conditions. For example, Lactobacillus or <b>Leuconostoc</b> are typically found in foods such as yogurt and wine. Also, consuming more carbohydrates increased the amount of sugars available to S. mutans for metabolism and lowered the pH of the oral cavity. This new acidic habitat would select for those bacteria that could survive and reproduce at a lower pH.|$|E

One, named pseudo-catalase activity, was insensitive to 0. 01 M-azide or 0. 01 M-cyanide {{and appeared to be}} the action of an acid-sensitive non-haem-containing enzyme detectable in some <b>leuconostocs</b> and pediococci when grown in media containing a low concentration of glucose.

The characteristics and activities of microbial communities in food material, {{at the time of}} processing, influences shelf life, quality, and spoilage rate. Present processing and storage conditions enable growth of bacterial species adapted to survive extreme conditions, making them a concern in the food industry as they result in food unfit or hazardous for human consumption. In this thesis, 16 S rRNA gene amplicon data was used to investigate the microbial community structure and composition sampled from a Finnish sausage processing factory. To roughly analyze the distribution of dominating bacterial species in each processing stage, the 16 S rRNA gene count data was filtered to retain OTUs having a non-zero, to greater than 50, read counts in more than 50 % of the samples, where differences in composition were tested for significance. A more thorough analysis included agglomerative hierarchical clustering using Ward’s minimum variance method, to explore OTU grouping based on their read count composition, across various food processing environments and within factory locations. Both approaches identified spoilage bacteria of the genus <b>Leuconostocs,</b> Pseudomonas, Brochothrix, Yersinia, Carnobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Clostridium dominating samples. Lactic acid bacteria such as <b>Leuconostocs</b> were found abundant in packaged product and emulsion samples whereas Brochothrix, Pseudomonas and Carnobacterium were abundant in nutrient rich mediums such as meat. The results of the analysis coincide with findings in literature. Factory equipment surfaces were abundant in spoilage species such as Brochothrix, Clostridium, and Yersinia, which are reported in literature to grow on meat and skin. Metal equipment surfaces had a higher incidence of spoilage bacteria compared to plastic surfaces. The current analysis also showed that the effect of extensive and daily cleaning leads to the higher growth of certain spoilage bacteria, instead of reducing their number.

The objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. Results These LAB displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main Gram-positive and Gram-negative fish pathogens. However, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus Enterococcus (86 %) (Enterococcus faecalis, 100 %; E. faecium, 79 %). Antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera Weissella (60 %), Pediococcus (44 %), Lactobacillus (33 %), but not in <b>leuconostocs</b> and lactococci. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7. 5 % of the non-enterococci, including the genera Pediococcus (12. 5 %) and Weissella (6. 7 %). One strain of both Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef (A/E), and another two P. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu (A) conferring resistance to lincosamides. Gelatinase activity was found in E. faecalis and E. faecium (71 and 11 %, respectively), while a low number of E. faecalis (5 %) and none E. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. None enterococci and non-enterococci showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first description of mef (A/E) in the genera Pediococcus and Weissella, and lnu (A) in the genus Pediococcus.

For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs {{of the six}} semisynthetic compounds for 90 % of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2, 048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY 264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0. 016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1, 024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant <b>leuconostocs</b> and pediococci. The MICs for 90 % of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0. 25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0. 25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0. 008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times {{lower than those of}} vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY 307599 and LY 333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci...|$|R
