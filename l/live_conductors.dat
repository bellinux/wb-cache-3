2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two <b>live</b> <b>conductors,</b> is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E
2500|$|When {{supplying}} {{a branch}} circuit {{with more than}} one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> are interrupted when any pole trips, a [...] "common trip" [...] breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common trip breakers are typically used to supply three-phase electric power to large motors or further distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the <b>live</b> and neutral <b>conductors.</b> In normal operation, all the current down the <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> returns up the neutral conductor. The currents {{in the two}} conductors are therefore equal and opposite and cancel each other out.|$|R
50|$|When {{the device}} is placed near a <b>live</b> <b>conductor,</b> a {{capacitive}} voltage divider is established, comprising the parasitic capacitance between the conductor and the sensor, and between the sensor to ground (through the user's body).

50|$|In {{electrical}} connections where voltage or current {{is sufficient to}} cause injury, the part permanently connected to the power source is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of <b>live</b> <b>conductors.</b> A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device receiving the power.|$|E
50|$|A Wireless {{powerline}} sensor {{hangs from}} an {{overhead power line}} and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the sensor does not contact anything but a single <b>live</b> <b>conductor,</b> no high-voltage isolation is needed. The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy scavenged from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured. Overhead power line monitoring helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.|$|R

50|$|Where {{electrical}} safety is an issue, {{various kinds of}} protected plugs and sockets are available. These have sliding covers on plugs or other devices to protect the user from accidental contact with <b>live</b> <b>conductors,</b> but are still largely compatible with the original design. A typical design is now required (IEC 61010) on digital voltmeter test leads and several other measurement and laboratory equipment. In this design, the metal banana plug is entirely sheathed in plastic and presses into a deep recess in the DVM. Alternatively, the equipment has the male part of the banana plug and it is deeply recessed; the test lead contains a sheathed banana jack. Also, the test lead wire is specified for higher voltage isolation.|$|E

50|$|In the UK, {{electric}} {{tools and}} portable lighting at construction sites {{are required to}} be fed from a centre-tapped system with only 55 V between <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> and the earth. This system is used with 110 V equipment and therefore no neutral conductor is needed. The intention {{is to reduce the}} electrocution hazard that may exist when using electrical equipment at a wet or outdoor construction site. Portable transformers that transform single-phase 240 V to this 110 V system are a common piece of construction equipment. Generator sets used for construction sites are equipped to supply it directly.An incidental benefit is that the filaments of 110 V incandescent lamps used on such systems are thicker and therefore mechanically more rugged than those of 240 V lamps.|$|E
50|$|Long undersea / {{underground}} high-voltage cables {{have a high}} electrical capacitance {{compared with}} overhead transmission lines, since the <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> within the cable are surrounded by a relatively thin layer of insulation (the dielectric), and a metal sheath. The geometry {{is that of a}} long co-axial capacitor. The total capacitance increases with the length of the cable. This capacitance is in a parallel circuit with the load. Where alternating current is used for cable transmission, additional current must flow in the cable to charge this cable capacitance. This extra current flow causes added energy loss via dissipation of heat in the conductors of the cable, raising its temperature. Additional energy losses also occur as a result of dielectric losses in the cable insulation.|$|E

5000|$|It is not {{a closed}} loop, because the second {{terminal}} is passed back {{through the center of}} the toroid core (commonly a plastic or rubber tube) and connected along the first terminal. This allows the coil to be open-ended and flexible, allowing it to be wrapped around a <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> without disturbing it. However, positioning of the measured conductor is important in that case: It has been shown that, with flexible sensors, the effect of the position on the accuracy ranges from 1 to 3%. Another technique uses two rigid winding halves with a precise locking mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Switches, circuit breakers, {{transformers}} {{and other}} apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures. The air space required increases with system voltage {{and with the}} lightning surge voltage rating. For medium-voltage distribution substations, metal-enclosed switch gear may be used and no <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> exposed at all. For higher voltages, gas-insulated switch gear reduces the space required around live bus. Instead of bare conductors, bus and apparatus are built into pressurized tubular containers filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas. This gas has a higher insulating value than air, allowing {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus to be reduced. In addition to air or SF6 gas, apparatus will use other insulation materials such as transformer oil, paper, porcelain, and polymer insulators.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} X10 is {{excessive}} attenuation of signals {{between the two}} <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may {{come and go as}} large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.|$|E
5000|$|Generally two {{separate}} overhead wires are used, with the rail {{for the third}} phase, though occasionally three overhead wires are used. At junctions, crossovers and crossings the two lines must be kept apart, with a continuous supply to the locomotive, which must have two <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> wherever it stops. Hence two collectors per overhead phase are used, but the possibility of bridging a dead section and causing a short circuit from the front collector of one phase to the back collector of the other phase must be avoided. The resistance of the rails used for the third phase or return is higher for AC than for DC because of the [...] "skin" [...] effect, but lower for the low frequency used than for industrial frequency. Losses are also increased, though {{not in the same}} proportion, as the impedance is largely reactive.The locomotive needs to pick up power from two (or three) overhead conductors. Early locomotives on the Italian State Railways used a wide bow collector which covered both wires but later locomotives used two pantographs side by side. In the United States, a pair of trolley poles were used. They worked well with a maximum speed of 15 mph. The dual conductor pantograph system is used on four mountain railways that continue to use three-phase power (Corcovado Rack Railway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jungfraubahn and Gornergratbahn in Switzerland and the Petit train de la Rhune in France).|$|E

25|$|The world’s first high-sensitivity {{earth leakage}} {{protection}} system (i.e. a system capable of protecting {{people from the}} hazards of direct contact between a <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> and earth), was a second-harmonic magnetic amplifier core-balance system, known as the magamp, developed in South Africa by Henri Rubin. Electrical hazards were of great concern in South African gold mines, and Rubin, an engineer at the company C.J. Fuchs Electrical Industries of Alberton Johannesburg, initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525 V and had a tripping sensitivity of 250 mA. Prior to this, core balance earth leakage protection systems operated at sensitivities of about 10 A.|$|R
5000|$|For {{very high}} {{currents}} in electrical apparatus, and for high currents distributed through a building, bus bars can be used. (The term [...] "bus" [...] is a contraction of the Latin omnibus - meaning [...] "for all".) Each <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> {{of such a}} system is a rigid piece of copper or aluminium, usually in flat bars (but sometimes as tubing or other shapes). Open bus bars are never used in publicly accessible areas, although they are used in manufacturing plants and power company switch yards to gain the benefit of air cooling. A variation is to use heavy cables, especially where it is desirable to transpose or [...] "roll" [...] phases.|$|R
