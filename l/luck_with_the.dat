5|$|Cornelius had no <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population of Rùm {{does appear to}} have become Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad <b>luck,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E

25|$|The AFL's {{free agents}} came from several sources. Some were players {{who could not}} find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League. In the late 1950s, many players {{released}} by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CFL, and later returned {{to the states to}} play in the AFL.|$|E
25|$|Bradman's <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coin toss {{continued}} in the series, as he won the toss and chose to bat first for the fourth occasion out of five. The Australian openers put on 48 runs before Sid Barnes was run out brilliantly by Adhikari. As usual, Bradman came out to bat at one-down and along with Bill Brown, he added 92 runs for the third wicket before something unfortunate for Australia happened. Bradman discovered that he had torn a rib muscle {{and was unable to}} play freely, so he retired hurt at 140/1. Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour, twenty-five minute 99, from 216 balls. Again he too was run out, but the other Australian batsmen scored handily. Sam Loxton, making his debut, scored a 155-ball 80, Lindwall, Tallon(the wicket-keeper), Len Johnson, and Bill Johnston contributed to the huge scoreline.|$|E
25|$|The 9th Brigade (Greneral Borke's) {{was formed}} in brigade order in rear of Sombreffe and northward of the Namur high road, having {{detached}} one of its Battalions (the 3rd of the 8th Regiment) with the foot battery No. 18, to Mont-Potriaux, where the former posted itself on the north, and the latter took up a favourable position on the south, side of the Church.

Four Battalions of the 10th Brigade (Colonel Kampfen) were drawn up on the Height of Tongrinne, resting their right on this village, and having in their front the Foot Battery No. 35, and at a short distance from their left, the Horse Battery No. 18.|$|E

500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. We must have done something right." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{its first}} major attempt at {{co-operation}} with the Americans, France sent Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing, with {{a fleet of}} 12 ships {{of the line and}} some French Army troops to North America in April 1778, with orders to blockade the British North American fleet in the Delaware River. Although British leaders had early intelligence that d'Estaing was likely headed for North America, political and military differences within the government and navy delayed the British response, allowing him to sail unopposed through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was not until early June that a fleet of 13 ships of the line under the command of Vice-Admiral John Byron left European waters in pursuit. D'Estaing's Atlantic crossing took three months, but Byron (who was called [...] "Foul-weather Jack" [...] due to his repeated bad <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> weather) was also delayed by bad weather and did not reach New York until mid-August.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the movies}} became {{a vital part}} of the {{entertainment}} industry, Berlin was forced to [...] "reinvent himself as a songwriter".
