40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> of {{selected}} actinides onto {{some of the}} most common sorbent materials which are present in caustic nuclear waste storage tanks have been determined. Some of these transition metal oxides and activated carbons easily absorb or precipitate plutonium, neptunium and even uranium, which if care is not taken may lead to unwanted accumulation of some of these fissile materials in nuclear waste tanks during waste processing. Based on a caustic synthetic salt solution simulant bearing plutonium, uranium and neptunium and ''real'' nuclear waste supernate solution, the <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> of these actinides onto iron oxide (hematite), activated carbon and anhydrous sodium phosphate have been determined. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> for plutonium onto granular activated carbon and iron oxide (hematite) in a caustic synthetic salt solution were, respectively, 3. 4 0. 22 plus or minus and 5. 5 plus or minus 0. 38 microgram per gram of sorbent. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> for plutonium onto a typical nuclear waste storage tank sludge solids was 2. 01 microgram per gram of sludge solids. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> for neptunium onto granular activated carbon and iron oxide (hematite) in a caustic synthetic salt solution were, respectively, 7. 9 plus or minus 0. 52 and greater than 10 microgram per gram of sorbent. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> for neptunium onto a typical nuclear waste storage tank sludge solids was 4. 48 microgram per gram of sludge solids. A typical nuclear waste storage tank solid material did not show any significant affinity for uranium.

Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version.

5|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore Branch {{passenger}} trains ended, the very last SIRT special—a train from Washington carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a state meeting in Washington, D.C. with President Eisenhower—crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge. There was a royal train and a press train and they traveled over the Reading Railroad and the B to get to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. Since British royalty was being transported, the movement was done in secrecy with high security. The trains reached the Camp by traveling via the Port Reading Branch of the Reading Railroad. In order to travel to Staten Island, which required traveling over the Arthur Kill swing bridge, the two trains had to be reconfigured. Done at the Camp, the two diesel locomotives in the front were dropped from the two consists, allowing the trains to pass over the bridge, which had a limited <b>load</b> <b>capacity.</b> Awaiting {{the return of the}} equipment from Staten Island, the two diesel trains were sent to Cranford Junction. On the morning of October 21, the press train, consisting of 10 cars, left the Camp in New Jersey and traveled to the SIRT via the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The royal train, which was constructed by Pullman Standard, followed an hour later. These two trains terminated at the Stapleton freight yard, which was cleaned up for the occasion. Each of the trains were hauled back to Cranford Junction by a SIRT switcher after the Queen's motorcade left the yard. The trains, that afternoon, then went south to Baltimore.|$|E

30|$|Railway {{rolling stock}} {{comprises}} all vehicles including locomotives, coaches, and wagons that move on a railway system. From {{a freight train}} operator’s point of view, we can consider two aspects: train capacity and wagon capacity. The train capacity is dependent, among other things, {{on the length of}} the train, as well as <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> (i.e. how much cargo can be carried). The capacity of a train can be broken down into two parts: volume (cubic) and mass (tonnage) <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> [2]. The cubic and tonnage capacity per train, together with higher average speed (may mean lower requirement of rolling stock for a certain amount of transport needs) drive both efficiency and higher capacity utilisation, since high fixed capital or ‘personnel’ costs per train contribute significantly to reducing the operational cost of a service. For the railway system as a whole, the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> per train, multiplied by train frequency, determines the overall system transportation capacity [4]. Moreover, the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> per train can be linked to axle <b>load.</b> The <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> per wagon is dependent on the number of axles, axle load, wagon tare mass, as well as the volume (cubic) and density (tonnage) of the cargo. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> per train can be limited by its useful volume, for example in the case of low‐density voluminous commodities, or by its load (mass) limit, for example in the case of high‐density heavy commodities.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model including convection, diffusion and Freundlich adsorption is developed. To examine {{the validity of}} the model, the affinity membranes were prepared by coating chitosan on the nylon membranes, a ligand of poly-L-lysine was bound to the chitoan-coating membranes, and the adsorption behavior of bilirubin through the stacked affinity membranes was investigated. The agreements between the theoretical and experimental results are exceptional. Using our new model, we show that: (1) As Pe increases, the breakthrough curves become sharper. For Pe greater than 30, the effect of axial diffusion is insignificant; (2) As m increases, the time of total saturation is delayed and the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> at the point of breakthrough is increased; (3) As n decreases, the time of total saturation is delayed and the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> at the point of breakthrough is increased; (4) As r increases, both the time of total saturation and the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> at the point of breakthrough are increased; (5) adsorption rate influences the time of total saturation strongly but contributes little to the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{predominant}} workflow for qualitative proteomics {{has been}} “GeLCMS,” {{a combination of}} 1 - (or 2 -D) gel electrophoresis with reverse-phase nanoflow liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The limited protein quantity isolated from a single gel band coupled with column <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> maximums necessitate the use of 75 μm ID packed columns for optimal sensitivity. However, limitations on sample injection volume, gradient and flow characteristics, and excessive delay volume hinder throughput. Novel methods for fractionating complex biological samples with higher <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> and more efficient recovery, such as novel solution phase tube-gel fractionation and others, demand a column format which maximizes on the extended dynamic range of these emerging techniques. Packed tip columns with a larger ID (150 μm to 200 μm) facilitate higher sample <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> and enable higher flow rates for improved cycle time while maintaining the optimal sensitivity realized in the nanobore packed tip columm format. Using peptide standards, single protein digests and whole yeast digests improvements in cycle time and sample <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> using 150 μm ID packed tip columns are demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} have shown significant potential for biomedical applications that require high <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> and controlled release of drugs. Nanoporous gold (np-Au), produced by an alloy corrosion process, is a promising novel material that benefits from compatibility with microfabrication, tunable pore morphology, electrical conductivity, well-established gold-thiol conjugate chemistry, and biocompatibility. While np-Au's non-biological applications are abundant, its {{performance in the}} biomedical field is nascent. In this work, we employ a combination of techniques including nanoporous thin film synthesis, quantitative electron microscopy, fluorospectrometry, and electrochemical surface characterization to study <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> and molecular release kinetics {{as a function of}} film properties and discuss underlying mechanisms. The sub-micron-thick sputter-coated nanoporous gold films provide small-molecule <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> up to 1. 12 μg cm - 2 and molecular release half-lives between 3. 6 hours to 12. 8 hours. A systematic set of studies reveals that effective surface area of the np-Au thin films on glass substrates plays the largest role in determining <b>loading</b> <b>capacity.</b> The release kinetics on the other hand depends on a complex interplay of micro- and nano-scale morphological features. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014...|$|R
40|$|Hollow {{mesoporous}} silica nanoparticles were successfully fabricated and functionalized with appropriate silanes. After modifications, amine, carboxyl, cyano, and methyl groups were grafted onto the nanoparticles and all functionalized hollow {{mesoporous silica}} nanoparticles maintained a spherical and hollow structure {{with a mean}} diameter of ~ 120 [*]nm and a shell thickness of ~ 10 [*]nm. The <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> of the hollow mesoporous silica nanoaprticles to the anticancer drug, 5 -fluorouracil, can be controlled via precise functionalization. The presence of amine groups {{on the surface of}} nanoparticles resulted in the highest <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> of 28. 89 %, due to the amine functionalized nanoparticles having a similar hydrophilicity but reverse charge to the drug. In addition, the change in pH leads to the variation of the intensity of electrostatic force between nanoparticles and the drug, which finally affects the <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> of amine functionalized hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles to some extent. Higher drug loading was observed at pH of 7. 4 and 8. 5 as 5 -fluorouracil becomes more deprotonated in alkaline conditions.

25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy <b>load,</b> <b>capacity</b> is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
