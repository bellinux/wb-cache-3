40|$|Abstract — Change in {{geotechnical}} behaviour of {{fine grained}} soils {{under the influence}} of inorganic salts depends on the chemistry of the soil constituents and the pore fluid. The modification of soil behaviour largely depends upon the clay particles which belongs to size 0. 002 mm and less and it is unique in nature. The different nature of clay is due to net electrical charge on them. In general, clay particles surface are negatively charged and its edges are positively charged. To preserve electrical neutrality the negative charge of the clay particle is balanced by the attraction of cations which are held between the layers, and {{on the surface of the}} particles. The charged clay surface together with the counter–ions in the pore water form diffuse double layer. Furthermore, the double layer is influenced by the valency of the counter–ions and the temperature. Use of salt solution as pore fluid generally causes decrease in <b>liquid</b> <b>limits.</b> The higher the cation valance, higher decrease in <b>liquid</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{activity}} (A) of a soil is the PI {{divided by}} the percent of clay-sized particles (less than 2 μm) present. Different types of clays have different specific surface areas which controls how much wetting is required to move a soil from one phase to another such as across the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> or the plastic limit. From the activity, one can predict the dominant clay type present in a soil sample. High activity signifies large volume change when wetted and large shrinkage when dried. Soils with high activity are very reactive chemically.|$|E
25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (friable) semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the shrinkage limit, is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this plastic state until its <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> is exceeded, which causes it to transform into a viscous liquid that flows when jarred.|$|E
2500|$|The liquid [...] limit (LL) is conceptually {{defined as}} the water content at which the {{behavior}} of a clayey soil changes from plastic to liquid.

40|$|International audienceThe {{difficulty}} in using above 2000 °C in an oxidizing atmosphere C/C composites as structural components is their poor life time. The solution proposed here consisted in combining two refractory carbides, hafnium and silicon carbides, in coating with a complex architecture, named a three dimensional coating, over a C/C substrate.

2500|$|The {{original}} <b>liquid</b> <b>limit</b> test of Atterberg's involved mixing a pat of clay in a round-bottomed porcelain bowl of 10–12cm diameter. A groove was {{cut through}} the pat of clay with a spatula, and the bowl was then struck many times against the palm of one hand. Casagrande subsequently standardized the apparatus and the procedures to make the measurement more repeatable. Soil is placed into the metal cup portion of the device and a groove is made down its center with a standardized tool of [...] width. The cup is repeatedly dropped 10mm onto a hard rubber base {{at a rate of}} 120 blows per minute, during which the groove closes up gradually {{as a result of the}} impact. The number of blows for the groove to close is recorded. The moisture content at which it takes 25 drops of the cup to cause the groove to close over a distance of [...] is defined as the <b>liquid</b> <b>limit.</b> The test is normally run at several moisture contents, and the moisture content which requires 25 blows to close the groove is interpolated from the test results. The <b>Liquid</b> <b>Limit</b> test is defined by ASTM standard test method D4318.

The {{representation}} of plasticity characteristics on Casagrande plasticity chart of glacial material samples, from an investigated area north of Chicago, IL, USA, confirmed the known alignment along the T line (Boulton and Paul, 1976) for {{the category of}} glacial materials. The goal {{of the present study}} was to identify the factors responsible for the plastic behavior of the glacial materials. We consider that this particular characteristic of plasticity is the result of grain size distribution with a minimum inter-granular space created by genetic glacio-clastic processes. Synergetic association between the minimum inter-granular void grain ratio, and the minimum efficient content of clay pallets around bigger grains, have an impact over plasticity behavior, lowering both <b>liquid</b> <b>limits</b> LL, and plasticity limit PL, but increasing the gap between these limits (the plasticity index) ...|$|R

2500|$|The Atterberg {{limits are}} a basic {{measure of the}} {{critical}} water contents of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and <b>liquid</b> <b>limit.</b> As a dry, clayey soil takes on increasing amounts of water, it undergoes distinct changes in behavior and consistency. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid. In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on {{a change in the}} soil's behavior. The Atterberg limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. These limits were created by Albert Atterberg, a Swedish agriculturist. They were later refined by Arthur Casagrande. These distinctions in soil are used in assessing the soils that are to have structures built on. [...] Soils when wet retain water and some expand in volume. [...] The amount of expansion is related to the ability of the soil to take in water and its structural make-up (the type of atoms present). These tests are mainly used on clayey or silty soils since these are the soils that expand and shrink due to moisture content. [...] Clays and silts react with the water and thus change sizes and have varying shear strengths. Thus these tests are used widely in the preliminary stages of designing any structure to ensure that the soil will have the correct amount of shear strength and not too much change in volume as it expands and shrinks with different moisture contents.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical interactions of a NaCl brine with six compacted fine grained soils was investigated in the laboratory. Specifically, the hydraulic conductivity (K), engineering properties, leaching properties and breakthrough phenomena were evaluated for these soils. The effect of elevating the soaking temperatures to 70 (DEGREES) C on the engineering index properties and closed isobaric batch reactor tests was also investigated. The K of brine {{was found to be}} greater than that of water in soils where the dominant clay was montmorillonite; whereas, a soil rich in illite and chlorite was virtually insensitive to variations in permeant solution composition. Long-term K testing with brine revealed that some compacted soils were prone to large increases in K. However, short-term testing of the same soils indicated a stable K. Long-term testing of all soils using water also indicated a relatively stable K. The batch reactors indicated that a brine extracted more silicon from the soils than the standard acid ammonium oxalate extraction. Similarly, more calcium was extracted than accountable by cation exchange capacity. Lysimeter studies indicated that the mass of material leached by the brine from the compacted soils was much less than the available amount of extractable material as demonstrated from the batch reactors. This implied that short circuiting was occurring. The breakthrough curves verified that channelling was occurring. Fractionation caused by anion exclusion and adsorption by the soils resulted in an increase in the mass ratio of chloride to sodium ions at low brine volume throughput. The moisture-mass density and <b>liquid</b> <b>limits</b> of soils that contained montmorillonite were significantly affected when soaked in brine. A lower optimum moisture content was achieved producing a greater mass density. An elevated soaking temperature of 70 (DEGREES) C enhanced this effect. A soil rich in illite and chlorite was not affected by brine soaking. The <b>liquid</b> <b>limits</b> of soils high in montmorillonite were greatly reduced, resulting in soil reclassification after soaking. A similar but less significant decrease was observed in soils in which illite and/or chlorite were present as the dominant clay minerals. The plastic limit was unaffected by soaking.
