2500|$|The theater shots, {{the primary}} {{component}} of an episode, is filmed in [...] "Shadowrama". The [...] "seats" [...] were a black-painted foamcore board {{sitting behind the}} seat (towards the camera) for the host, and stages for the Crow and Tom puppets. The human host wore black clothing while the robot puppets were painted black; the screen they watched was a white <b>luma</b> <b>key</b> screen as to create the appearance of silhouettes. The actors would follow the movie and the script through television monitors located in front of them, as to create the overall theater illusion.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{real-time}} multi-source HD {{facilities have}} many {{pieces of equipment}} that all output HD-SDI video. If this baseband video is to be mixed, switched or <b>luma</b> <b>keyed</b> with any other sources, then {{they will need to}} be synchronous, i.e. the first pixel of the first line must be transmitted at the same time (within a few microseconds). This then allows the switcher to cut, mix or key these sources together with a minimal amount of delay (~1 HD video line 1/(1125Ã—25) seconds for 50i video). This synchronization is done by supplying each piece of equipment with either a tri-level sync, or black-and-burst input. There are video switchers that do not require synchronous sources, but these operate with a much bigger delay (~1 video frame).|$|R
