5000|$|In 1986, Canada and Nova Scotia {{signed a}} $34-million {{agreement}} to dredge the Tar Ponds and pump the sediments through a mile-long pipeline to a <b>low-temperature</b> <b>incinerator</b> and power plant. After many delays, the incinerator was completed, and passed required air emissions tests, in 1994. However, the pipeline system proved unable {{to handle the}} thick, lumpy Tar Ponds sludge, and the fluid-bed incinerator {{was hit by a}} series of technical problems. The sediments were also found to contain [...] "at least 50,000 tonnes" [...] of PCB contaminants which could only be disposed of by high-temperature incineration. The project was abandoned in 1995.|$|E
