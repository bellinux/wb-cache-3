40|$|An {{analysis}} of operational capabilities of inclined drilling equipment and technology is presented. Two options of rotary drilling are reviewed as technical and technological solutions, facilitating construction of wells <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>profiles.</b> The first option {{implies that the}} driver unit of the drill bit is represented by downhole drilling motor, the second one utilizes sophisticated rotary steerable systems. Practical results of drilling wells <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>profiles</b> are presented. A quality assessment of drilling is provided through the example of comparing designed and actual trajectories, using different driver units for the drill bit, as well as properties of surrounding rocks, rheology of the drill fluid and other characteristics of dynamically active systems. A range of rotation speed has been determined that allows rotary steerable systems to have minimal oscillation amplitude of the bottom-hole assembly.   Analysis of investigation {{results showed that the}} main source of oscillations is linked to bending and compressing stresses, caused by well deviations as well as rigidity of the drilling tool. In effect, in the bottom-hole assembly occur auto-oscillations, making it impossible to correct azimuth and zenith angles. Alteration of rigidity in the bottom part of the tool and drilling parameters, implying reduced rotation speed of the drill string and regulation of drill bit pressure, can partially solve this problem, though increase in rotation speed is limited by technical characteristics of existing top drive systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} that the positive link between task interest and performance attainment can be negatively affected by the pursuit of difficult performance-approach goals. This was tested in a sample of 60 undergraduate students at a Dutch university. In <b>line</b> <b>with</b> expectations, for <b>difficult</b> performance-approach goals there was no link between task interest and performance attainment. Furthermore, among women this relation turned out to be negative. In an easy performance-approach goal condition, a positive link between task interest and performance attainment was found for both men and women, while in the control condition the same expected positive relation was not found. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. </span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Renewable energy {{resources}} are inexhaustible, clean {{as compared with}} conventional resources. Also, {{it is used to}} supply regions with no grid, no telephone <b>lines,</b> and often <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> accessibility by common transport. Satellite earth stations which located in remote areas are the most important application of renewable energy. Neural control is a branch of the general field of intelligent control, which is based on the concept of artificial intelligence. This paper presents the mathematical modeling of satellite earth station power system which is required for simulating the system. Aswan is selected to be the site under consideration because it is a rich region with solar energy. The complete power system is simulated using MATLAB–SIMULINK. An artificial neural network (ANN) based model has been developed for the optimum operation of earth station power system. An ANN is trained using a back propagation with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The best validation performance is obtained for minimum mean square error. The regression between the network output and the corresponding target is equal to 96 % which means a high accuracy. Neural network controller architecture gives satisfactory results with small number of neurons, hence better in terms of memory and time are required for NNC implementation. The results indicate that the proposed control unit using ANN can be successfully used for controlling the satellite earth station power system...|$|R
30|$|Because {{siblings}} {{might have}} to cope <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> situations, they might experience psychosocial problems. Hence, psychosocial well-being of participants was assessed as a background characteristic. In our sample, psychosocial well-being of siblings was worse than the norm, except for conduct problems. Siblings also reported more prosocial behavior than the norm. This is in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> what is experienced in clinical practice; siblings of children with chronic conditions tend to be typically friendly and helpful. These results stress {{the vulnerability of the}} siblings in our sample. The finding that siblings had more psychosocial problems than peers in some domains but not in all is also in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> previous research [4, 32]. Effect sizes {{in the present study were}} moderate, whereas former studies show mostly small effect sizes [4]. The current study provides no information about possible positive effects of being a sibling of a child with a chronic condition. Better understanding of positive effects could provide insight into potential helpful coping strategies that others can benefit from.|$|R

We offer on-cology clinicians guidance in dealing <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> outpatients by discussing the differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary man-agement of treatment-disrupting behavior in the ambulatory on-cology setting. We review the existing literature on dealing <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> pa-tients and present clinical experience at a comprehensive cancer center where a formalized, institutional process for responding to disruptive outpatients has been developed. A structured, multidisciplinary approach to deal <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> behavior in oncology outpatients can improve care and staff morale. Staff using this approach can identify causes of treat-ment-disrupting behavior, develop and implement appropri-ate behavior plans, facilitate communication, address mental health issues, and ensure that decisions to terminate a rela-tionship with a patient are ethical, clinically justified, and sup-ported by due process. In the future, clinical recommendations and institutional guidelines for dealing <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> patients should be evalu-ated with more structured, quantitative research...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the clinical usefulness of serum thymidine kinase (TK) activity for diagnosing bovine leukosis cases for which clinical diagnosis was <b>difficult</b> (‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’). Median TK activity values in 24 ‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’ and 36 cattle for which BL was clinically confirmed by cytology findings of enlarged superficial lymph nodes (‘clinically confirmed BL’) were 36. 8 and 39. 4 U/l, respectively (no significant difference). The percentage with positive TK activity (> 5. 4 U/l) was also similar {{in both groups}} (83. 3 % for ‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’ and 97. 2 % for ‘clinically confirmed BL’). TK activity was significantly higher in cows <b>with</b> ‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’ compared to those with other tumors (N= 13) and those with inflammatory diseases (N= 14). Maximum TK activity in cows with other tumors and inflammatory diseases was not high (< 10 U/l). Median TK activities in cows with other tumors and those with inflammatory diseases were 1. 8 and 1. 4 IU/l, respectively. Positive TK activity {{was found in a}} significantly higher percentage of cows <b>with</b> ‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’ (83. 3 %) relative to the percentages of cows with other tumors (15. 3 %) and inflammatory diseases (21. 4 %). Thus, TK activity is an appropriate marker for detecting BL onset in cows <b>with</b> ‘BL <b>with</b> <b>difficult</b> diagnosis’ as well as ‘clinically confirmed BL’ group. While the specificity of TK activity required for BL diagnosis is not clear, simultaneous evaluation of serum lactate dehydrogenase activity may assist in the differential diagnoses of other tumors and inflammatory diseases from BL.
