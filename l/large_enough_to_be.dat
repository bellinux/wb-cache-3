5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), {{since they are}} {{sensitive}} to water pollution, and are <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assessed conveniently in the field. Some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies {{may be found in}} waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E
5|$|Examples of extortionate {{ransomware}} became {{prominent in}} May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E

5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rodrigues solitaires.

5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity.

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 Mickiewicz severed {{his ties}} with Towiański, {{following}} {{the rise of}} revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in {{events such as the}} Kraków Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towiański's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.|$|E

5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves {{as evidence of}} homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such {{that some people are}} able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of aquatic {{activities}} to enjoy on Malta as well as Gozo and Comino. Northern Malta {{is home to the}} country's beach resorts and holiday areas, with the beaches most popular with holiday-makers being Mellieha Bay, Ghajn Tuffieha and Golden Bay. These beaches are <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to house cafes, restaurants and kiosks, but small enough to be crowded rarely. Malta's northwest is home to the island's quietest beaches, and it is on these that the main island's neighbouring two are nearest. Gozo and Comino are also popular beach spots for holiday-makers, although these {{are much more likely to}} be quieter, rockier and more suitable for snorkelling. The Mediterranean Sea surrounding Malta is popular for diving - while shallow dips may be attractive to beginning divers, more experienced divers may be able to dive deeper to find historical artifacts from World War II or earlier.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reproductive ants. However, {{it is possible that}} nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Saturn are {{numerous}} and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer {{across to the}} enormous Titan, which {{is larger than the}} planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ellipsoidal in shape, though only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition {{is similar to that of}} comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate presence of liquid water under its south pole region and could potentially harbor a global ocean under its surface.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2008, 38 {{species are}} {{considered}} by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hunted; the principal cause {{of the decline in}} antbird species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated, in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá antwren in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.|$|E
