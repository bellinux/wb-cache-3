5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> {{transported to}} the moon, which is portrayed as a green field with a single, large tree in the centre with masked {{children}} playing underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado <b>link</b> <b>is</b> confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Link locates the eight {{underground}} labyrinths, defeats several guardian monsters, and retrieves the fragments. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> able to infiltrate Ganon's hideout, Death Mountain, eventually confronting the pig-like enemy and destroying him with a Silver Arrow. Link picks up the Triforce of Power from Ganon's ashes and returns both pieces of the Triforce to the rescued Princess Zelda, restoring peace to Hyrule.|$|E
30|$|Although some {{of these}} {{potential}} <b>links</b> <b>are</b> mutually exclusive, {{it is possible that}} different <b>links</b> <b>are</b> operating in parallel or at different stages of the evacuation process (e.g., in the pre-evacuation and the evacuation period). Future research is necessary to identify which of the potential <b>links</b> <b>are</b> the most important interrelations of RP and protective actions.|$|R
30|$|PtP <b>links</b> <b>were</b> also evaluated. These are {{expensive}} in BSU hardware {{but the main}} limitation in using these <b>links</b> <b>is</b> that a dedicated frequency and bandwidth required, restricting scalability.|$|R
50|$|<b>Be</b> <b>linked!</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} in 2005. It was later {{taken over by}} Desh package as all the <b>Be</b> <b>linked!</b> customers <b>were</b> automatically migrated to Desh.|$|R
5|$|In the present, knight-in-training Link passes {{his final}} exam despite the {{attempted}} interference {{of his class}} rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend Zelda. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> led to the island's statue of Hylia by Fi, {{the spirit of the}} Goddess Sword residing within the statue. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way to the Surface, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> also confronted by Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, giving the two time to depart through a Time Gate into the past which Impa destroys as they pass through.|$|E
5|$|Link and {{his three}} transformations receive {{different}} reactions from non-player characters. For instance, the Goron and Zora are allowed to exit Clock Town at will, whereas the Deku Scrub is not permitted to leave by reason of his childlike appearance. Animals also interact differently with the four forms of Link. For example, Link's normal form receives an indifferent response from dogs, Deku <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> attacked by them, Goron Link frightens them, and Zora Link makes them chase him happily.|$|E
5|$|Link, {{who is the}} {{apprentice}} of a blacksmith, goes to deliver a sword to a captain at Hyrule Castle, only to encounter a mysterious figure named Yuga, who transforms a descendant of a Sage, Seres, into a painting. After being knocked out during the fight, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> found by a merchant named Ravio, who gives him a bracelet in exchange for being allowed to stay in his home, and tells him to report {{what had happened to}} Princess Zelda. After going to Hyrule Castle, Zelda gives Link the Pendant of Courage and instructs him to seek out the pendants of Power and Wisdom in order to gain the power of the Master Sword. Along the way, Link encounters Yuga again and is turned into a painting himself. However, thanks to Ravio's bracelet, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> protected from Yuga's spell and gains the ability to merge with walls and move around as a painting. After finding the other pendants and obtaining the Master Sword, Link returns to Hyrule Castle where he witnesses Yuga transform Zelda into a painting. Link pursues Yuga through a dimensional crack, arriving in the twisted decaying kingdom of Lorule. There, Yuga uses Zelda and the descendants of the Seven Sages, who he had all trapped inside paintings, to revive Ganon and fuse with him, obtaining the Triforce of Power in the process. Just then, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> assisted by Princess Hilda, the ruler of Lorule, who traps Yuga in magic bonds.|$|E
5000|$|The Rajputana-Malwa Railway {{extended}} the [...] wide metre gauge Delhi-Rewari line to Bathinda in 1884. The metre gauge Hisar-Sadulpur <b>link</b> <b>was</b> laid in 1911. The Bhiwani-Rohtak <b>link</b> <b>was</b> laid in 1979.|$|R
3000|$|To {{organize}} a reliable clustered hierarchy for an IPSN, two different transmission ranges for reliable <b>links</b> <b>are</b> considered {{depending on the}} link types. The transmission range for intra-group <b>links</b> <b>is</b> r [...]...|$|R
3000|$|... is {{the total}} degree of node i. This {{coefficient}} is closer to 1 if the <b>links</b> <b>are</b> uniformly distributed among all modules and 0 if all <b>links</b> <b>are</b> within the same module.|$|R
5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.|$|E
5|$|Albany Highway commences at The Causeway, a river {{crossing}} that connects to Perth's central business district. The highway heads south-east through Perth's metropolitan region, and continues through the southern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions to Albany {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. Albany Highway is generally a two-lane single carriageway road, but with additional lanes and dual-carriageway sections in Perth and Albany. The highway is allocated State Route30, except for bypassed sections in Perth, and the southernmost portion in Albany. The part bypassed by Kenwick <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> allocated Alternate State Route30, and a short length in Arthur River is concurrently allocated State Route107. Albany Highway also carries sections of Heritage Country Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive205) and Great Southern Tourist Way (Tourist Drive356).|$|E
5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears screaming. In a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} use {{geometry}} {{to study the}} movement of a mechanism, its <b>links</b> <b>are</b> modeled as rigid bodies. This means distances between points in a <b>link</b> <b>are</b> assumed to be unchanged as the mechanism moves, that <b>is</b> the <b>link</b> does not flex. Thus, the relative movement between points in two connected <b>links</b> <b>is</b> considered to result from the kinematic pair that joins them.|$|R
50|$|How {{and when}} Traits <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>is</b> {{definitely}} open to interpretation. The Quickstart Preview only says that “Linked Traits should make sense {{in how they}} <b>are</b> <b>Linked</b> together. The Editor has the final say on whether the <b>Links</b> <b>are</b> applicable” (CC&VF Quickstart, pg. 4).|$|R
5000|$|The Bathinda-Rewari metre {{gauge line}} was {{converted}} to [...] wide broad gauge in 1994. The metre gauge Hisar-Sadulpur <b>link</b> <b>was</b> converted to broad gauge in 2009. Bhiwani-Rohtak <b>link</b> <b>was</b> also converted to broad gauge.|$|R
5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame of Despair. Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who is attempting to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> seen waving to a crowd from a sailboat off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E
5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak <b>link</b> <b>is</b> often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This <b>link</b> <b>is</b> based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
30|$|Build {{categories}} We classified {{their responses}} into attributes, consequences, and values {{based on the}} presence of the “from” link and the “to” link. Factors with a “from” link and without a “to” <b>link</b> <b>were</b> classified into the “values” category; factors with both a “from” link and a “to” <b>link</b> <b>were</b> classified into the “consequences” category; factors with only a “to” <b>link</b> <b>were</b> classified into the “attributes” category (Reynolds and Gutman 1988).|$|R
50|$|One variant is Twixt PP (Paper and Pencil). The {{rules are}} almost {{identical}} to standard TwixT, except <b>links</b> <b>are</b> never removed and your own <b>links</b> <b>are</b> allowed to cross each other. A winning path might loop across itself but crossed <b>links</b> <b>are</b> not connected to {{each other at the}} intersection. The P-P rules may reduce the number of draws (already rare) and somewhat reduce the complexity of the game.|$|R
30|$|A linkage is a {{collection}} of rigid rods called links. The endpoints of various <b>links</b> <b>are</b> connected by joints, each joint connecting two or more <b>links.</b> The <b>links</b> <b>are</b> free to rotate around the joints.|$|R
5|$|<b>Link</b> <b>is</b> rescued at Windfall Island by {{a talking}} boat, the King of Red Lions, who {{explains}} that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku Tree and the plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl with the water spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath the ocean to a castle suspended in time. Here Link finds the Hero of Time's weapon, the Master Sword.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this <b>link</b> <b>is</b> particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a young boy named Link, who is tasked with {{restoring}} peace to the kingdom of Hyrule, after a malevolent sorcerer named Yuga captures Princess Zelda and escapes through a rift to the ruined world of Lorule. Yuga seeks to kidnap the Seven Sages and use their power to resurrect the Demon King, Ganon. <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> granted with the ability to merge onto walls as a painting after obtaining a magical bracelet and encountering Yuga. This new ability allows Link to reach previously inaccessible areas and travel between Hyrule and Lorule.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} chckerboard colorability for virtual links and {{abstract}} <b>links</b> <b>is</b> introduced.

50|$|Due {{to lack of}} customers, the Cherbourg <b>link</b> <b>was</b> soon {{dropped in}} favour of a direct link with Guernsey to St Malo. The direct St Malo to Guernsey <b>link</b> <b>was</b> dropped mid-August 2008 after about two months operating.|$|R
5|$|The Adventure of <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> {{a direct}} {{sequel to the}} {{original}} The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Links emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was {{a significant departure from}} its predecessor. , the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> {{part of two}} routes, European Route E39 and County Road 542. The section from Stord to Sveio, {{including}} the Stord Bridge and the Bømlafjord Tunnel, is part of E39—the Coastal Highway—which runs along {{the west coast of}} Norway. The section from the interchange on Føyno, {{including the}} Bøla Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge, is on County Road 542. The link acts both as a mainland connection for Stord and Bømlo to the mainland at Sveio, as well as a link between the two island communities, which have a combined population of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle <b>Link</b> <b>is</b> {{partially}} financed with tolls, with {{toll collection}} {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

40|$|Motivations for the {{creation}} of hyperlinks to business sites were analyzed through a content analysis approach. Links to 280 North American IT companies (71 Canadian companies and 209 U. S. companies) were searched through Yahoo!. Then a random sample of 808 <b>links</b> <b>was</b> taken from the links retrieved. The content as well as the context of each <b>link</b> <b>was</b> manually examined to determine why the <b>link</b> <b>was</b> created. The country location and the type of the site where the <b>link</b> came from <b>were</b> also identified. The study found that most <b>links</b> <b>were</b> created for business purposes confirming findings from early quantitative studies that links contain useful business information. <b>Links</b> to competitors <b>were</b> extremely rare but competitors were often co-linked, suggesting that co-link analysis is the direction to pursue for information on competitive intelligence.
