The rates of psychological disturbance and social ineptitude are found to be relatively high among <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists. <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists tend to create their own ideologies that combine personal frustrations and aversion with broader political, social, or religious aims.

50|$|The term <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} terrorist actions carried out by individuals from those coordinated by large groups. Terrorist attacks that are carried out by small cells are not classified as <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> attacks. <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> attacks are far more rare than attacks carried out by groups. Since 1940, there have only been around 100 successful <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> attacks in the United States.

40|$|This {{literature}} review examines {{the phenomenon of}} <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism. There seem to be some important {{factors that contribute to}} an individual's deciding to become a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorist instead of joining a larger terrorist group or network. Although there seems to be consensus about terrorists being psychologically stable, it is likely that some <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists could be diagnosed with various forms of psychopathology. Also, <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism is often preceded by a personal event linked to the upcoming terrorist act - something that has made the political personal. Strong reciprocity and group identification are other factors that could contribute to a person becoming a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorist. But to what extent these factors differ in <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> and group terrorism is unclear. Another important variable is a more general pattern of acting alone, as well as being socially isolated. Research on <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> in a variety of other contexts reveals that these individuals are less likely to trust others to do their job properly. This could also be the case in <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explains}} how economic analysis {{can contribute to}} the delineation of the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf's</b> opportunities and choices in a manner that allows operationally relevant advice to be contributed to the investigative process. Using a risk-reward analytical framework we examine the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf's</b> attack method opportunities and choices and identify those attack methods that would be chosen by <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> with different levels of risk aversion. We also use prospect theory as an alternative methodology for the determination of the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf's</b> preference orderings over the available attack methods in a context where he references his actions against those of a predecessor whom he wishes to emulate. We find that <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists with different levels of risk aversion can be expected to choose different attack methods or combinations of attack methods. More risk averse <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists will choose attack methods such as assassination. Less risk averse <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists will choose attack methods such as bombing, hostage-taking and unconventional attacks. Also, we find that <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists who reference their <b>actions</b> against 'predecessor' <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists will choose differently from among the available attack methods depending on which predecessor <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> is being referenced. The analysis provides two different perspectives on terrorist choice but by no means exhausts the analytical alternatives. The analysis focuses on the fatalities and injuries inflicted whereas other perspectives might include different 'payoffs' series, including news or media coverage. The chapter contributes an analysis of the order in which <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorists with particular characteristics will choose from a set of available attack methods. During the course of our discussion we point out the consistency between the 'rise' of the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorist and the diseconomies to scale that are evident within the terrorism context. This presents the opportunity for new debates. ...|$|R
