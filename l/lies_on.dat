50|$|The Euler line of any {{triangle}} {{goes through}} the triangle's orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes), its centroid (the intersection of its three medians), and its circumcenter (the intersection of its three sides' perpendicular bisectors, which {{is the center of}} the circumcircle that passes through the three vertices). In an isosceles triangle with exactly two equal sides, the Euler line coincides with the axis of symmetry. This can be seen as follows. Since as pointed out in the previous section the axis of symmetry coincides with an altitude, the intersection of the altitudes, which must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> that altitude, must therefore <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the axis of symmetry; since the axis coincides with a median, the intersection of the medians, which must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> that median, must therefore <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the axis of symmetry; and since the axis coincides with a perpendicular bisector, the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, which must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> that perpendicular bisector, must therefore <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the axis of symmetry.|$|R
