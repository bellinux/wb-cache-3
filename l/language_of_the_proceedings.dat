The other six testifying to Cragh's execution included the hanged man himself, despite William de Briouze's stated belief that he had {{died of natural causes}} about two years earlier. The official <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> was ecclesiastical Latin, but Cragh spoke only Welsh, therefore two Franciscan friars from Hereford– John Young and Maurice of Pencoyd– were recruited as translators. Cragh is identified in the commission's records by his Welsh name, William ap Rhys, [...] "of the parish of Swansea in the diocese of Saint Davids". Of the eight other witnesses called, five testified in French and three in English. In his evidence Cragh stated that he believed himself to have been about 28 {{at the time of his}} hanging, and that his last conscious memory as he was dangling at the end of the rope was of the noise made by the crowd when Trahaern was hanged beside him. He denied his earlier story of having seen a vision of a white-clad bishop while he was hanging from the gallows, and instead claimed that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him on the morning of his execution, accompanied by [...] "a lordly figure" [...] she introduced as [...] "St Thomas", who she said would save him from the gallows. Under questioning Cragh said that he presumed the figure to be Cantilupe because he had been on pilgrimage to Cantilupe's shrine in Hereford, and because on the day of his imprisonment he had [...] "bent a penny ... to the honour of Saint Thomas so that he should liberate him". After hearing his testimony the commissioners physically examined Cragh, to confirm that he was indeed the man who had been hanged 18 years earlier. Although they found no marks around his neck they did discover some scarring on his tongue, according to Cragh caused by him having bitten it while hanging.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the translation of legal texts in criminal proceedings as a human right. Language rights have been recognized in a series of instruments, notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and more recently the Directive 2010 / 64 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. The latter has been defined by EP rapporteur Ludford as the first EU fair trial law whereby translation becomes a tool for the inclusion of those who do not speak or understand the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> After an analysis of the Directive in the first part, this paper will tackle its implementation in the member states, which have taken advantage of its vagueness, hardly changing current practices. Finally, a training format developed within the EU project QUALETRA will be presented in the third part of the paper to address the quality requirements set out in the Directive...|$|E
40|$|It {{is obvious}} that equal access to justice starts with the pre-trial phase. Police {{interviews}} (be it the questioning of a suspect, witness or victim) are therefore {{a key factor in}} information gathering. These interviews are the starting point to collect evidence, possibly leading to a trial. Semi-structured interviews reveal how police officers in Antwerp (Belgium) manage to work with interpreters when interpreter-mediated questioning is necessary, but also show that they often do not employ professional interpreters. When policemen appoint interpreters they do so in a fairly personal and arbitrary manner and the Antwerp list of sworn interpreters is not always consulted. Police officers are not aware of a specific legal interpreting training program in the same city (Antwerp) as a necessary condition for being included in the local list of sworn interpreters. During interpreter-mediated interviews the interpretation allows equal access to justice to people who do not speak the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> (Directive 2010 / 64 /EU). This raises both ethical and quality-related issues: the interpreters' self-awareness of professional norms in this socio-cultural context requires contextualized ethics. The interpreter is not alone in the triad: the police officer leads the questioning and therefore the concept of shared responsibility must be introduced. Moreover, the police officers’ lack of awareness about qualitative interpreting should be overcome by training sessions on how to look for professional interpreters and subsequently on how to efficiently work with them in an ethically correct way. The most efficient way to do so is to organize joint training sessions with interpreters and police officers in the same classroom. status: publishe...|$|E
