Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the <b>bowl</b> inside a <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|R

50|$|The Avoriaz-pistes {{are divided}} in 4 sectors: The Lindaret, Haut-Forts, Fornet and Super Morzine.

In the Lindaret-valley one finds The Stash - a conceptual snowpark developed by Burton and based on ecological principles. It {{is the only one of}} its kind in France. There are a number of restaurants and a small village at the bottom of the valley. The Fornet area is a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> basically skiing everywhere between huge rocks and crevasses. From one of the ridges around the Fornet bowl one can test the famous La Chavanette - also known as The Swiss Wall, one of the steepest pistes in Europe - it is not part of the Avoriaz-system but belongs to neighbouring Swiss resort Les Crosets. Haut-Forts is the most demanding area with a number of black runs starting at 2.400 and ending at 1.100 metres, some of which are for experts only. The world cup piste - although rated black - is pretty easy though. This area is also ideal for off-piste although caution is advised since this is an area with frequent avalanches. From the Haut-Forts top-station it is possible to ski directly back to Avoriaz by red or blue slopes.|$|E
5000|$|A bricklayer, Spasa Kostiƒá, {{came running}} {{to the office of}} Dr. Goƒëevac, saying that Voivode Gligor Sokoloviƒá and his fighters had {{returned}} from the battlefield and had been falsely imprisoned by the Belgrade Police, and that Sokoloviƒá was wounded in the head. Dr. Goƒëevac quickly contacted the borough manager, and the band was immediately released. In Palilula, at the Dva Pobratima caf√©, owned by a Nikola from Kru≈°evo, Sokoloviƒá found his brother who worked in the Belgrade water system. Dr. Goƒëevac had not yet visited the Voivode whom he had freed, so he walked the Varo≈°-kapija (an historical neighbourhood) at noon, and Vasa Jovanoviƒá (minister) told him that a group of chetniks had dinner at Razman's a≈°ƒçinica (traditional restaurant). The baker, Damƒçe, took Dr. Goƒëevac in and pointed at where Sokoloviƒá sat. At a fat-soiled table sat three chetniks in front of a steaming <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> pasulj. Upon noticing Vasa Jovanoviƒá, the three jumped up, and a puzzled Sokoloviƒá gave his hard hand, full of calluses. Sokoloviƒá was young, with bright blue eyes, timid in his moves, humble, he seemed to have nothing hajduk (brigand) about him. Only his great stature gave light of enormous power. After he had finished his meal, Vasa Jovanoviƒá escorted him to Dr. Goƒëevac. Dr. Goƒëevac, who was almost disappointed since the encounter, asked him about the head wound. Sokoloviƒá gave an embarrassed smile and replied -"It's nothing...", [...] "Who wounded you?", -"We had a fight..." [...] - he was suspicious, and avoided long conversations. Dr. Goƒëevac began healing his wounds; his head wound was a result from a gun stock blow, and though it was not severe, it had been neglected. Little by little, Sokoloviƒá began opening himself up, telling the story of his life.|$|E
