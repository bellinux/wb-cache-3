40|$|This paper explores how {{hand-held}} {{cameras are}} used in fictional narrative films and Internet video clips, setting out to describe the range of functions the resulting stylistic <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> effects may perform in audiovisual narration. To make the step from the actual use of hand-held consumer cameras (or similar devices) in production to a concept for textual analysis, it is first of all necessary to describe {{the ways in which}} this technical practice manifests itself within the aesthetic structure of the audiovisual text. This contribution will, therefore, first define the constitutive stylistic features of <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> aesthetics. It will then proceed with some theoretical remarks {{on the role of the}} ‘camera’ in audiovisual narration. On this basis, a context-sensitive narratological analysis of prototypical examples will be conducted, leading to a typology of <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> use that focuses on its functions as a device in audiovisual narration. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} robust {{extraction}} of visual odometry from {{a sequence of}} images obtained by an eye in <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> configuration is addressed. A novel approach toward solving planar template based tracking is proposed which performs a non-linear image alignment for successful retrieval of camera transformations. In order to obtain global optimum a biometaheuristic is used for optimization of similarity among the planar regions. The proposed method is validated on image sequences with real as well as synthetic transformations and found to be resilient to intensity variations. A comparative analysis of the various similarity measures as well as various state-of-art methods reveal that the algorithm succeeds in tracking the planar regions robustly and has good potential {{to be used in}} real applications...|$|R
50|$|The Canonflex was {{inspired}} to an extent by the company's rangefinder camera models. It has a thumb-operated wind-on lever on the camera's base and a removable meterless finder prism, which slides off after depressing {{a button on the}} left <b>hand</b> <b>camera</b> front. The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the shutter release to the left, before or while depressing the release button. It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it was replaced by the Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|R

30|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{environment}} and the recording setup is an important factor for designing automated visual detectors because it enables the derivation of constraints and visual clues that facilitate detection. In an uncontrolled environment like wildlife video, as investigated in this work, the identification of robust constraints and clues is difficult. The video material we investigate has been captured by different people with a <b>hand</b> <b>camera.</b> Recordings were partly made in an ad hoc fashion. This means that we cannot make assumptions {{about the environment}} and the camera operation. As a consequence, we have to rely on the very basic visual cues such as shape, texture, motion, and color for the detection of elephants. Prior to the design of our method, we have investigated the suitability of the different visual cues.|$|R

On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>camera</b> metadata related to capture conditions provides cues independent of the captured scene content {{that can be used}} to improve classification performance. We consider three problems, indoor-outdoor classification, sunset detection, and manmade-natural classification. Analysis of camera metadata statistics for images of each class revealed that metadata fields, such as exposure time, flash fired, and subject distance, are most discriminative for each problem. A Bayesian network is employed to fuse content-based and metadata cues in the probability domain and degrades gracefully even when specific metadata inputs are missing (a practical concern). Finally, we provide extensive experimental results on the three problems using content-based and metadata cues to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed integrated scene classification scheme...|$|R

Currently, many commercially available systems can interpret face images in an efficient way but are generally limited to only one specific application domain. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>cameras</b> are becoming a useful tool in human life and are the vital constituent of most of the interactive systems. In this regard, we present a technique to develop a unified set of features extracted from a 3 D face model. These features are successfully used for higher level facial image interpretation in different application domains. We extract the feature once and use the same set of features for three different applications: face recognition, facial expressions recognition and gender recognition and obtain a good accuracy level while preserving the generality and efficiency of our feature extraction technique. The proposed technique is easy to implement and real time...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} review {{research}} results of camera self-calibration achieved in photogrammetry, robotics and computer vision. Then we propose {{a method for}} selfcalibration of robotic <b>hand</b> <b>cameras</b> by means of active motion. Through tracking a set of world points of unknown coordinates during robot motion, the internal parameters of the cameras (including distortions), the mounting parameters {{as well as the}} coordinates of the world points are estimated. The approach is fully autonomous, in that no initial guesses of the unknown parameters are to be provided from the outside by humans for the solution of a set of nonlinear equations. Sufficient conditions for a unique solution are derived in terms of controlled motion sequences. Methods to improve accuracy and robustness are proposed by means of best model identification and motion planning. Experimental results in both a simulated and a real environments are reported. Key words: self-calibration, hand-cameras, hand-eye calibration [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{considering}} {{the transition from}} the text being presented by the computer to the user moving a camera across a printed page, Bliss realized that there was a critical flaw {{in the design of the}} Veteran Administration Stereotoner. Since English alphabetic characters can be adequately displayed with 12 vertical pixels, the Stereotoner designer had assumed that only 12 photocells would be needed in the camera. However, this assumes perfect alignment between the camera and the printed text, which is never the case with a <b>hand</b> held <b>camera.</b> When the alignment is random, as with a <b>hand</b> held <b>camera,</b> a well known engineering theorem states that twice as many pixels are needed. Therefore, the Optacon was designed with 24 vertical pixels instead of 12. This theorem isn’t applicable in the horizontal dimension, so the columns in a two dimensional array can be twice as far apart as the rows.|$|R
