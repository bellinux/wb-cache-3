In 1998, Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level. In 2008, Faisalabad District ranked 51.9% which placed the district 9th in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} {{a victory for the}} Japanese and it proved {{instrumental}} in helping them to regain the initiative in the northern sector of Bougainville. As a result, shortly afterwards the Australian forces on Bougainville changed the focus of their operations to the southern sector of the island where they were able to advance along the coastal plain towards the main Japanese position at Buin. Since the end of the war, there has been considerable criticism of the planning undertaken by the Australians prior to the operation, and {{it has been argued that}} the operation failed due to poor intelligence and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and was ultimately unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{available}} in international emergency medicine {{may be seen in}} the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
5|$|After the {{demotion}} of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially {{worked together}} well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible {{due to a}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{and a lack of}} a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city failed and, due to the Crusaders' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> the siege became a stalemate. However, the arrival of {{craftsman}} and supplies transported by the Genoese to Jaffa tilted the balance in their favour. Crusaders constructed two large siege engines; the one commanded by Godfrey breached the walls on 15July 1099. For two days the Crusaders massacred the inhabitants and pillaged the city. Historians now believe the accounts of the numbers killed have been exaggerated, but this narrative of massacre did much to cement the Crusaders' reputation for barbarism. Godfrey further secured the Frankish position by surprising the Egyptian relief force commanded by the vizier of the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, at Ascalon. This relief force retreated to Egypt, with the vizier fleeing by ship. At this point most of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe, leaving behind Godfrey with a mere 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend Palestine. Of the other princes, only Tancred remained with the ambition to gain his own princedom.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s the Australian Army's organisation, {{equipment}} and doctrine {{were similar to}} those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports. While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan, little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia's eastern seaboard, along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia. The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s, but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> as a result of limited defence expenditures. Nevertheless, the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war, and indeed {{during the course of the}} war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{considered}} the low-level sight's chief advantages would be demonstrated under operational conditions. The sight {{was considered}} a great advancement on any previous method of low-level bombing, either by eye or with a bombsight. The best figures from No. 59 Squadron's trials were 6yd range error with release from 800ft, and 5yd error when approaching at 100ft, but releasing from 400ft with the aircraft's nose slightly up. Some academics in the ORS stated a 20yd error range existed but maintained the Mark III was promising. Some crews did not trust the device, which was the case when asked to use equipment of which they had little experience. Instead, many continued relying on their own trusted eyesight. A continued <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> meant there was no widespread use of the sights. In later months, the aircrew changed tactics and with new weapons, they decided {{that it would take}} too long to zero-in on a target using the device. Pilots and crew often opted to use their own judgement by direct sighting with considerable success.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM {{for some of the}} volumes, who agreed to work on the history without {{financial}} compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 1937, Captain Félix Verdeja, {{commanding}} the maintenance {{company of the}} Nationalist Batallón de Carros de Combate ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately develop a new light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45millimetre (1.77in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15millimetres (0.6in), with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30millimetres (1.2in); road speed of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra, commanding officer of the Agrupación de Carros de Combate. Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza {{to continue with the}} construction of the prototype.|$|E
5|$|The British raid on Batavia had {{destroyed}} 28 vessels. In addition to Phoenix, William and the merchant ships, Pellew's squadron had burnt the 18-gun brigs Aventurier and Patriot, the 14-gun Zee-Ploeg, the 10-gun Arnistein, the 8-gun Johanna Suzanna and the 6-gun Snelheid. Just three ships were captured: two merchant vessels and Maria Wilhelmina. The {{elimination of the}} smaller vessels of the Dutch squadron was an important victory for Pellew, leaving only the larger ships of the line at large. These ships were old and in poor condition, limiting the threat they posed to British trade routes. Nevertheless, Pellew returned to the Java Sea in 1807 {{in search of the}} warships, destroying them at the Raid on Griessie in November, a year after the success at Batavia. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in the region and the threat posed by the French Indian Ocean island bases delayed larger scale British operations against the East Indies until 1810, when a series of invasions rapidly eliminated the remaining Dutch presence in the Pacific.|$|E

The resulting Kings Bay Affair, where unsafe mining had been approved to maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard, ultimately led to vote of no confidence in Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's third cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil, rather than samples. Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence, contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union. Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, {{and in particular the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements.

5|$|Macrinus was {{at first}} {{occupied}} {{by the threat of}} the Parthians, with whom Rome had been at war since the reign of Caracalla. Macrinus settled a peace deal with the Parthians, after fighting an indecisive battle at Nisibis in 217. In return for peace, Macrinus was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Parthian ruler Artabanus V. Rome was at the time also under threat from Dacia and Armenia, so any deal with Parthia would likely have been beneficial to Rome. Next, Macrinus turned his attention to Armenia. In 216, Caracalla had imprisoned Khosrov I of Armenia and his family after Khosrov had agreed to meet with Caracalla at a conference to discuss some issue between himself and his sons. Caracalla instead installed a new Roman governor to rule over Armenia. These actions angered the Armenian peoples and they soon rebelled against Rome. Macrinus settled a peace treaty with them by returning the crown and loot to Khosrov's son and successor Tiridates II and releasing his mother from prison, and by restoring Armenia to its status as a client kingdom of Rome. Macrinus made peace with the Dacians by releasing hostages, though this was likely not handled by himself but by Marcius Agrippa. In matters of foreign policy, Macrinus showed a tendency towards settling disputes through diplomacy and a reluctance to engage in military conflict, though this may have been due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and manpower than his own personal preference.|$|E
