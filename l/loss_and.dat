In addition we examine differences in tendency to avoid <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> decreases in earnings across industries.

5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E

First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} global food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste has {{recently}} received much attention {{and has been}} given high visibility. According to FAO, almost one-third of food produced for human consumption – approximately 1. 3 billion tonnes per year – is either lost or wasted globally: their reduction is now presented as essential to improve food security and to reduce the environmental footprint of food systems. In this context, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), in its Thirty-ninth Session (October 2012) requested the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) to undertake a study on “Food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste {{in the context of}} sustainable food systems” to be presented to the CFS Plenary in 2014. The very extent of food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste invites to consider them not as an accident but {{as an integral part of}} food systems. Food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste are consequences of the way food systems function, technically, culturally and economically. This report analyses food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste in a triple perspective: a systemic perspective, a sustainability perspective, including the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability, and a food security and nutrition perspective, looking at how food <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> waste relate to the various dimensions of food security and nutritio...|$|R

5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease.

It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
