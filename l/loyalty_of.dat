5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E
5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The {{marriage}} {{was important for}} Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the marriage was a guarantee for Helmichis of the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.|$|E

5|$|Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never {{attempted}} another nationalist rebellion, {{and remained}} loyal to Rome {{until the fall}} of the Western Empire in 476 AD. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing in the political unity of Rome's governing figures– partly over concerns over the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> Caesar's Gallic troops to his person rather than the state– that were soon to drive Rome into a lengthy series of civil wars.|$|E

As such, Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and his unborn child is a son.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as a testament to the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> Oyasama's followers.|$|E
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E

5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, while Belisarius remained in Carthage strengthening its walls, Gelimer established {{himself and the}} remnant of his army at Bulla Regia. By distributing money {{he had managed to}} cement the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the locals to his cause, and sent messages recalling Tzazon and his men from Sardinia, where they had been successful in re-establishing Vandal authority and killing Godas. While waiting for Tzazon's arrival, the Vandal king's army also increased by the arrival of more and more fugitives from the battle of Ad Decimum, as well as by a contingent of his Moorish allies. Most of the Moorish tribes of Numidia and Byzacena, however, sent embassies to Belisarius, pledging allegiance to the Empire. Some even offered hostages and asked for the insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by the emperor: a gilded silver staff and a silver crown, a white cloak, a white tunic, and a gilded boot. Belisarius had been furnished by Justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand, and duly dispatched them along with sums of money. Nevertheless, it was clear that, as long as the outcome of the war remained undecided, neither side could count on the firm <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the Moors. During this period, messengers from Tzazon, sent to announce his recovery of Sardinia, sailed into Carthage unaware that the city had fallen and were taken captive, followed shortly after by Gelimer's envoys to Theudis, who had reached Spain after the news of the Roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance. Belisarius was also reinforced by the Roman general Cyril with his contingent, who had sailed to Sardinia only to find it once again in possession of the Vandals.|$|E

5|$|Following the rebels' rout at Deir al-Ghusun on 14 July, Ibrahim Pasha's troops {{proceeded}} to Nablus unhindered, passing through Arraba, the loyalist stronghold of the Abd al-Hadi family, {{and then through}} Sanur, the throne village of the Jarrar clan. When they entered Nablus on 15 July, no resistance was put up, and shortly afterward, the rest of Jabal Nablus submitted to Muhammad Ali's troops. For the most part, due to the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the Abd al-Hadi's to Muhammad Ali, and the neutrality of the powerful Nimr clan, {{the inhabitants of the}} city of Nablus had not participated in the revolt. From Nablus, Ibrahim Pasha dispatched his troops north to occupy Jenin and Nazareth, before arriving in Jerusalem on 20 July with 30,000 new conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa.

Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E
5|$|Gaozong {{received}} Helu's plea {{and agreed}} to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings.

Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in a mound decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the <b>loyalty</b> <b>of</b> the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks.|$|E
