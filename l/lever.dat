5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a <b>lever</b> for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single <b>lever</b> added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the <b>lever</b> to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the <b>lever</b> is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

They include an unfinished replica of Liverpool Castle, overlooking the Lower Rivington Reservoir, and Rivington Gardens, the remains of Lever's private gardens, which include the Pigeon Tower, a large folly and former dovecote.

5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a <b>lever</b> for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the <b>lever</b> in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the <b>lever</b> back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
40|$|Portfolio Diversification with Commodity Futures: Properties of <b>Levered</b> Futures This study extends {{previous}} {{work on the}} impact of commodity futures on portfolio performance by explicitly incorporating <b>levered</b> futures into the portfolio optimization problem. Using data on nine individual commodity futures and one aggregate index from 1994 - 2003, we find that collateralized and <b>levered</b> futures strategies perform similarly in an ex-post context. Significant differences between the approaches emerge however when constraints on investment behavior exist. Further, <b>levered</b> futures do not result in a prohibitive number of margin calls. The investment performances of the collateralized and the <b>levered</b> strategies vary little across different rebalancing intervals, and frequent portfolio rebalancing does not necessarily result in superior performance.

50|$|In most cockpit setups, {{reverse thrust}} is set when the thrust <b>levers</b> are on idle by pulling them further back.

Reverse thrust is always selected manually, either using <b>levers</b> attached to the thrust <b>levers</b> or moving the thrust <b>levers</b> into a reverse thrust 'gate'.|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite many {{strategies}} {{employed to}} improve hand hygiene, compliance remains low at around 50 %. Two reasons {{have been identified}} for this. First, implementation strategies are rarely tailored according to assessed barriers and <b>levers</b> to best practice. Secondly {{there is a lack}} of explicit theoretical basis for the assessment of these barriers and <b>levers</b> to practice. Aim: This paper reports barriers and <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene and an evaluation of the use of theory in assessing barriers and <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene. Methods: Identification of barriers and <b>levers</b> occurred through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. In each case two different question schedules were used, one based on psychological theory and the other with no explicit theoretical underpinning. Results: Although there was considerable overlap in the barriers and <b>levers</b> identified using the two schedules there were also marked differences. Conclusions: Identification of further barriers and <b>levers</b> may help us address lack of compliance with hand hygiene. Using a theoretical framework may prompt the identification of barriers that people may not ordinarily report but which have an important impact on behaviour, particularly emotion...|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to {{a decrease in the}} population when farms were cleared, the valley flooded and property {{in the western part of}} the village demolished.

5|$|In 1838 Great Bolton, most of Little Bolton and the Haulgh area of Tonge with Haulgh were {{incorporated}} under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as a municipal borough, {{the second to}} be created in England. Further additions were made adding part of Rumworth in 1872 and part of Halliwell in 1877. In 1889 Bolton was granted County Borough status and became self-governing and independent from Lancashire County Council jurisdiction. In 1898, the borough was extended further by adding the civil parishes of Breightmet, Darcy <b>Lever,</b> Great <b>Lever,</b> the rest of Halliwell, Heaton, Lostock, Middle Hulton, the rest of Rumworth which had been renamed Deane in 1894, Smithills, and Tonge plus Astley Bridge Urban District, and part of Over Hulton civil parish.

5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton <b>Lever</b> in 1775. <b>Lever</b> turned the house into a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E
