25|$|One {{end of the}} Grand Union Canal (Grand Junction Canal – Main Line) is at Brentford on the River Thames in west London, {{where the}} canal follows the {{engineered}} course of the River Brent. The double Thames Lock at Brentford acts as the demarcation point between the Thames, administered by the Port of London Authority, and the River Brent/Grand Union Canal, administered by the Canal & River Trust. The locks on the canal are numbered south from Braunston, and Thames Lock is <b>lock</b> <b>number</b> 101.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>number</b> {{one on the}} Kennet and Avon Canal is Hanham Lock, {{first opened}} [...] {{as part of the}} Avon Navigation in 1727. It is the first lock east of Netham, the {{upstream}} limit of the Floating Harbour, beyond the suburbs of the city of Bristol. A colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock, but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century. The river below Hanham Lock is considered to be tidal, as high tides often pass over the weir at Netham. Some spring tides pass over the weir at Hanham, making the river tidal up to Keynsham Lock. Heading east, the river passes the Somerdale Factory, on its southern bank, which was a chocolate production factory for Cadbury – originally built by the Fry family in the 1920s and 1930s. On the northern bank is Cleeve Wood, the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of Bath asparagus (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum).|$|E

25|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>numbering</b> {{changed over}} the years. As {{mentioned}} before, Guard Lock No. 2 was <b>numbered</b> <b>Lock</b> 24 for a time, which could cause confusion with Riley's Lock, No 24, upstream. For {{a period of time}} in the early days, the locks were called by letters but that was later changed to numbers. Oddly enough, many of the <b>lock</b> <b>numbers</b> correspond to the contour elevation, e.g. Lock 26 is at the 260 foot elevation line, and lock 30 is at the 300 foot mark, although it is doubted that things were planned that way, and many locks do not correspond to the elevation, e.g. Lock 72 is at the 580 foot mark.|$|R

50|$|Locks of the Rappahannock Navigation are {{numbered}} {{from where the}} Rappahannock empties into the Chesapeake Bay and increase incrementally travelling upstream; guard <b>locks</b> are not <b>numbered.</b> Therefore, <b>lock</b> <b>numbers</b> of the Rapidan Canal range from six (the lowest lock) to nine (the most upstream lock), inclusive, with a guard lock at the upstream end of the canal. The table below contains more specific information about the particulars of each lock.|$|R

Later, in 1872, a new steam pump was put near mile 174.|$|R

50|$|There was a {{community}} of Lockville, first settled around 1805 about 3/4 mile (1.2 km) on the east {{of what used to}} be known as Miller's Basin in the vicinity of the current East Union and Vienna streets. The name of 'Lockville' came from its location near three <b>locks,</b> <b>numbered</b> 57, 58 and 59, built on the original Erie Canal route. In 1839, Lockville became incorporated as the Village of Arcadia. It merged into Newark when that community was incorporated as a village in 1853.|$|R
