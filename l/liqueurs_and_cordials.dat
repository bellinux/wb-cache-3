5000|$|Embury {{stresses}} frequently {{that the}} drink {{will never be}} any better than {{the quality of the}} cheapest ingredient in it, and hence he stresses constantly the need for the highest quality spirits, <b>liqueurs,</b> <b>cordials,</b> <b>and</b> modifiers (fresh squeezed lemons, etc.). He also repeatedly stresses that a cocktail, in the classic sense (a before-dinner drink) should have no more than the slightest touch of sweetness to it, and deplores the use of drinks like the Brandy Alexander as pre-prandial cocktails, as they dull rather than sharpen the appetite. He does not denigrate sweet drinks as such, but rather points out that they are excellent after dinner or mid-afternoon drinks accompanying cake or chocolate cookies, but they are anathema as a [...] "cocktail" [...] before a large meal.|$|R

50|$|The {{fruit of}} European Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) {{can be made}} into a {{slightly}} bitter jelly which in Britain is traditionally eaten as an accompaniment to game, and into jams and other preserves, on their own, or with other fruit.

Czechs also make a Rowan liquor called jeřabinka and the Welsh used to make one called diodgriafel.|$|E
