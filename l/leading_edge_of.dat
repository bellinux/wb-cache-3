5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} and longest arc was Fraternité; {{the faintest}} was Courage. The normal optical {{depths of the}} arcs are estimated to lie in the range 0.03–0.09 (0.034±0.005 for the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation); the radial widths are approximately {{the same as those}} of the continuous ring—about 30km. The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15km (0.77±0.13km for the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%. The arcs in the Adams ring are somewhat similar to the arc in Saturn's G ring.|$|E

This work {{is motivated by}} interest in researching the flow field properties <b>of</b> power-law shaped <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> as a possible candidate for blunting <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> waveriders. Both aerodynamic and aerothermal characteristics are calculated for a waverider forebody in hypersonic flow. Comparisons are made between power-law shaped <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and round <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> For the flow conditions considered, the power-law <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> waveriders can provide small drag, {{and at the same}} time it can bring enough bluntness for the necessity of thermal protection...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located {{on the right side}} of the aircraft near the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing.

5|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area.

40|$|Based on {{the premise}} that sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are {{beneficial}} for launch, ascent and landing phases several concepts for sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> winged re-entry vehicles have been scrutinized. On the other side blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> mitigate the heat loads during re-entry. Therefore, to comply with material temperature limits either sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> have to be cooled or the curvature shape must be changed between ascent/landing and re-entry flight phases. Sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes are enabled by transpiration cooling, heat pipe or other heat load relieving concepts. Changing the wing profile, i. e. shape morphing is a research topic in aircraft development which progresses steadily. Basic feasibility of concepts for morphing the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> hypersonic flight vehicles has been studied within a recent ESA technology contract. A shape morphing compliant mechanism <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> fully based on CMC materials indicates advantages compared to other concepts...|$|R
5|$|Warm fronts {{are at the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements.

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E

At hypersonic speeds _ the problem of fixing boundary-layer transition near the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the model components with-out distorting the turbulent-boundary-layer velocity profile has not been solved...|$|R
50|$|In-flight ice buildups {{are most}} {{frequent}} on the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the wings, tail and engines (including the propellers or fan blades). Lower speed aircraft frequently use pneumatic de-icing {{boots on the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> wings and tail for in-flight de-icing. The rubber coverings are periodically inflated, causing ice to crack and flake off. Once the system is activated by the pilot, the inflation/deflation cycle is automatically controlled. In the past, it was thought such systems can be defeated if they are inflated prematurely; if the pilot did not allow a fairly thick layer of ice to form before inflating the boots, the boots would merely create {{a gap between the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and the formed ice. Recent research shows “bridging” does not occur with modern boots.|$|R
