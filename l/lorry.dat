5|$|He married Eva Caroline Camamile at All Saints' Church, Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire, in 1921. In 1932, {{while working}} as traffic manager for a <b>lorry</b> firm, Crumley {{suffered}} head injuries when the <b>lorry</b> he was travelling in struck a stationary vehicle; his two colleagues were killed. At the time, {{he was living in}} the Kensington district of London. His death at the age of 90 was registered {{in the second quarter of}} 1981 in the Merton registration district, which covers the London Borough of Merton.|$|E
5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK <b>lorry</b> and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The <b>lorry</b> was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
50|$|Also {{included}} was a transport echelon of 300 donkeys, seventeen tractors, thirty-four trucks, five ammunition <b>lorries</b> {{and fourteen}} supply <b>lorries.</b> The Desert Mounted Corps and the infantry XX and XXI Corps, by comparison had thirty and 120 ammunition and supply <b>lorries</b> for the mounted corps to sixty and 180 ammunition and supply <b>lorries</b> for the infantry corps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lorries</b> {{are also}} used as bush taxis (French bâché): they are normal <b>lorries</b> (trucks) with benches {{along the sides of}} the bed for passengers. There is often a cover for the bed as well. <b>Lorries</b> are more robustly made (and give a rougher ride) than {{purpose-built}} passenger vehicles; routes over worse roads and to more remote areas are often serviced by <b>lorries.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the <b>lorry,</b> and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the <b>lorry,</b> while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the <b>lorry</b> drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the <b>lorry</b> and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E

40|$|This study mainly investigates whether {{retroreflective}} {{markings on}} the rear of <b>lorries</b> have caused {{a reduction in the}} number of accidents with parked <b>lorries</b> in the Netherlands. It appears that there has been a considerable decrease in the number of accidents with parked <b>lorries</b> and trailers. It is concluded that the current retroreflective markings {{on the rear}} of <b>lorries</b> probably have a small effect. This might be explained by either the pollution of or damage to these markings. However, there are still accidents in which the visibility of <b>lorries</b> in darkness can play a role. Therefore, other, improved application forms of retroreflective material on the rear of <b>lorries</b> should be looked for...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2004, due to both {{excessive}} {{checks on}} <b>lorries</b> carrying excess load and the forced unloading of excess <b>lorries,</b> the expressway virtually {{broke down and}} created a massive traffic jam that would last for over a month. A massive, 56 hour+ traffic jam erupted. After October 8, 2004, the checkpoint at Kangzhuang, Beijing, forced large <b>lorries</b> to undergo a unified weight inspection. Given that winter was coming, and many <b>lorries</b> were overloaded with coal, {{a great number of}} <b>lorries</b> failed the test. The result: the authorities enforced a rule of [...] "unload or we won't let you through".|$|R

5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives {{concluded}} that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the <b>lorry,</b> driving and sleeping in it {{for at least some}} of that time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another <b>lorry</b> driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan is an English <b>lorry</b> {{driver and}} former heating {{engineer}} from Poole. One {{of five children}} of John and Julianne Morgan, {{he was raised in}} Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother– a refugee from the former East Germany– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a <b>lorry</b> driver in 1991.|$|E

Both of the couples are nearing the same clock tower where they died in their past lives. A worried Chaitanya is offered a lift by a young biker who follow them. On 10:20 AM when all the four are safe near the clock tower, a <b>lorry</b> driven by a drunk driver is shown rushing towards them. The biker and Chaitanya jump from the bike, which goes on to hit the <b>lorry</b> tyre, distracting the lorry's path. The four thank Chaitanya who urges them to thank the biker, Akhil.|$|E

5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} a small company, {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation. The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 <b>lorry</b> and 66 bus chassis models; for 116 <b>lorry</b> models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00am on 1 August, a Georgian police <b>lorry</b> {{was blown}} {{up by an}} improvised {{explosive}} device on the road near Tskhinvali, injuring five Georgian policemen.

50|$|On 1 January 2014, {{a soldier}} from the Turkish {{gendarmerie}} reported that several <b>lorries</b> were transporting weapons to Syria. In response, the Adana Prosecutor Aziz Takçı requested {{the police to}} conduct a search on the <b>lorries.</b> With the alleged influence of Adana Governor Hüseyin Avni Coş, the police officially recorded the cargo of the <b>lorries</b> as 'humanitarian aid', with soldiers not being permitted {{to attend to the}} scene.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January, <b>lorries</b> {{allegedly}} carrying {{weapons and}} bound for Syria were stopped in Adana, while a similar convoy of <b>lorries</b> were stopped on 19 June in Hatay. The prosecutor Aziz Takçı, who ordered the <b>lorries</b> {{to be stopped}} and searched for weapons after receiving a tip-off, was later removed from his position and branded {{as a member of}} Gulen's 'parallel structure'. The government attempted to cover up the lorries' cargo and to stop the searching of their contents on both occasions, with it becoming apparent that they belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MİT). The accusation that MİT <b>lorries</b> were carrying weapons into Syria created yet another scandal, especially {{at a time when the}} government in the centre of international controversy for their policy of inaction against Islamic State militants. Erdoğan stated that the contents of the <b>lorries</b> were a national secret, but later claimed that they had been carrying humanitarian aid to the Turkmen population in Syria. He branded the prosecutor and gendarmerie troops involved in the search of the <b>lorries</b> as parallel structure sympathisers and many were subsequently arrested.|$|R

5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French <b>lorry</b> driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes <b>lorry.</b> Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, VAT {{delivered}} the first Vanaja VAKS lorries, which were intended for general use in garrisons, to the Defence Forces. The later versions were called AS-33. 155 units were produced. Vanaja NS-47 {{was the first}} Finnish 4×4 off-road <b>lorry</b> designed primarily for military use. A few dozen vehicles were ordered between 1962 and 1964, and were used for hauling 35 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons and heavy artillery.|$|E
50|$|The scandal {{broke out}} on 1 January 2014, when an {{anonymous}} call {{was made to}} the Adana Attorney General, claiming {{that a number of}} <b>lorries</b> {{were on their way to}} Syria carrying weapons on both days. Despite the Turkish Gendarmerie conducting a search on 19 January, their search was cut short by the Governor of Adana Hüseyin Avni Coş, who claimed that the <b>lorries</b> belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MİT). The prosecutor who ordered the search, as well many of the Gendarmerie soldiers who conducted it, were all removed from their posts and some faced legal investigation. The government, then led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, first claimed that the cargo of the <b>lorries</b> were a 'national secret', but later claimed that the <b>lorries</b> were carrying food and medical supplies to the Turkmen population in Syria. Many critics of the government alleged that the <b>lorries</b> were in fact supplying arms to rebel groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War.|$|R
