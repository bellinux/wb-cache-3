[...] The main undercarriage was very simple, with two wheels mounted on a bent chrome-nickel alloy tube which passed through the fuselage bottom. [...] This placed the wheels well clear of the fuselage horizontally - the track was 3ft 9 in (1.14 m) - but left the Wee Bee sitting close to the ground.

40|$|Due to the {{relative}} infancy of Parkour there is currently a lack of empirical evidence {{on which to base}} specific technique instruc-tion upon. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the ground reaction forces and loading rates involved in two Parkour land-ing techniques encouraged by local Parkour instructors and a traditional landing technique recommended in the literature. Ten male participants performed three different drop landing tech-niques (Parkour precision, Parkour roll, and traditional) onto a force plate. Compared to the traditional technique the Parkour precision technique demonstrated significantly less maximal vertical landing force (38 %, p < 0. 01, ES = 1. 76) and <b>landing</b> <b>loading</b> rate (54 %, p < 0. 01, ES = 1. 22). Similarly, less maximal vertical landing force (43 %, p < 0. 01, ES = 2. 04) and <b>landing</b> <b>loading</b> rate (63 %, p < 0. 01, ES = 1. 54) were observed in the Parkour roll technique compared to the traditional technique. It is unclear whether or not the Parkour precision technique pro-duced lower <b>landing</b> forces and <b>loading</b> rates than the Parkour roll technique as no significant differences were found. The landing techniques encouraged by local Parkour instructors such as the precision and roll appear to be more appropriate for Park-our practitioners to perform than a traditional landing technique due to the lower <b>landing</b> forces and <b>loading</b> rates experienced...|$|R

2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Bernard 60 was conventional with {{a rounded}} fin and rudder and a tailplane with a swept leading edge mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. It had a split axle undercarriage with single mainwheels mounted on V-form struts from the lower fuselage longerons and <b>landing</b> <b>loads</b> taken by vertical struts to the wing just inboard of the engines, combined with a tailskid. The trimotor Bernard 60 was unusual in having different engines in the nose and on the wings. [...] The central engine was a nine-cylinder, [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ady Jupiter, with five cylinder, [...] Gnome-Rhône 5Bc Titan engines on the wings. [...] The designers would have preferred about 225kW (300hp) from each of three identical engines but early in 1929 there were no available homologated types of this power.|$|E
2500|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. [...] They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse fuselage struts, but the rear socket was made oversize and the spar attached with a bolt and split pin to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward skid mounting point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of <b>landing</b> <b>loads</b> to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. [...] A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|E
2500|$|The Orao, {{originally}} {{without a}} type number, first flew in 1948. [...] After the national championships it underwent some small modifications, chiefly {{the removal of}} dihedral from the tailplane, to become the Orao II. [...] After the tailboom failed catastrophically during a demonstration flight in 1950, killing the pilot, the Orao was seriously redesigned into the Orao IIC. [...] The wing plan was unaffected but the airfoil section of the outer panels was thinned from Göttingen 549 to 682. [...] Longer span, shorter chord plain flaps replaced the Fowler flaps and the ailerons were simplified, retaining only the outer pair. There were two suspected causes of the tail failure; the effect of repeated landing shocks and possible tail flutter. [...] The fuselage underside was reshaped to distribute <b>landing</b> <b>loads</b> better and the fin was increased in area with a shallow dorsal fillet. [...] The horizontal tail was made narrower, with straight taper and all ply covered, placed far enough forward so no rudder cut out in the now horn balanced elevators was required. [...] The canopy was lengthened and made as {{a single piece of}} better aerodynamic form. [...] Twin shoulder release hooks, placed just behind the wing leading edge, were added for Y-end towlines. The modifications added about 50kg (110lb) to the empty Orao IIC; the improved aerodynamics raised the glide ratio from about 32:1 to 36:1.|$|E
