50|$|In China, every listed {{company is}} {{required}} to have a board secretary. According to article 124 of 2005 Company Law, every listed company {{is required to}} have a secretary {{to the board of}} directors. The responsibilities of board secretary include preparing meetings of shareholders and boards of directors, maintaining company records and shareholders information, dealing with information disclosure etc. Relevant <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> in China further clarify that the secretary of the Board is a managerial position. Such <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> discuss duties of board secretary in details. According to “Special Provisions of the State Council Concerning the Floatation and Listing Abroad of Stocks by Limited Stock Companies”, “Guidance for the Articles of Listed Company”, “Stock <b>Listing</b> <b>Rules</b> of the Shanghai Stock Exchange” and “Stock <b>Listing</b> <b>Rules</b> of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange”, the secretary of the Board is classified as the senior management team. From those <b>listing</b> <b>rules,</b> the board secretary, or the secretary of the board of directors, in China is comparable as the company secretary in many other countries.|$|R
40|$|In a joint {{submission}} to the Australian Stock Exchange Limited ("ASX") dated December 1989 (the "Joint Submission") the Law Institute of Victoria and the Law Council of Australia expressed the view that: "The ASX should be contained to its role {{of ensuring that}} the market is informed, efficient and fair, and not be allowed to effectively legislate on substantive issues of law outside this role. " 1 It was suggested in the Joint Submission that the ASX, through its <b>listing</b> <b>rules,</b> had over-extended its role so as to encroach on substantive company law matters which were more properly within the province of Parliament. 2 These criticisms have resulted in a considerable degree of public debate on the proper role of the ASX and the scope of its <b>listing</b> <b>rules.</b> 3 In response to the Joint Submission and the public debate, a discussion paper was released by the ASX in October 1990 (the "Discussion Paper") 4 in which the ASX expressed its views on these issues and invited submissions from interested members of the public. In its Discussion Paper, the ASX largely defended its perception of its current role in the business community and argued that the <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> did not exceed their proper scope (although this view has since been refined). It was conceded by the ASX, however, that some of the concerns expressed in the Joint Submission relating to the drafting and adoption of <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> had some validity". 5 It was also conceded that some <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> would be better contained in legislation. Both the Joint Submission and the Discussion Paper of the ASX will be examined in detail in this paper. Central to the argument concerning the proper scope of the ASX <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> are sections 777 and 1114 of the Corporations Law (formerly sections 42 and 14 respectively of the Securities Industry Act 1980) which grant "statutory recognition" to the <b>listing</b> <b>rules.</b> On the view put forward in the Joint Submission, the <b>listing</b> <b>rules</b> do not have the clarity expected of legislation, which gives rise to uncertainty of their application in practice. 6 Such uncertainty is increased, so it is said, 7 by {{the fact that in the}} foreword to the <b>listing</b> <b>rules,</b> the ASX states that it looks to listed companies to comply with the "spirit' as well as the letter" of the <b>listing</b> <b>rules.</b> According to the Joint Submission, this gives rise to the undesirable possibility of action under the Corporations Law (formerly under Securities Industry Act 1980) to enforce the spirit of the <b>listing</b> <b>rules.</b> 8 Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{the present}} day {{scenario}} online social networks (OSN) are very popular {{and one of the}} most interactive medium to share, communicate and exchange numerous types of information like text, image, audio, video etc. All these publicly shared information are explicitly viewed by connected people in the blog or networks and having an enormous social impact in human mind. Posting or commenting on particular public/private areas called wall, may include superfluous messages or sensitive data. Information filtering can therefore have a solid influence in online social networks and it can be used to give users the facility to organize the messages written on public areas by filtering out unwanted wordings. In this paper, we have proposed a system which may allow OSN users to have a direct control on posting or commenting on their walls with the help of information filtering. Whenever user posts a message it will be intercepted by the filtered wall, and applies Filtering and Black <b>List</b> <b>Rules</b> to the message. If it is not violated by filtering and black <b>list</b> <b>rules,</b> then the message will be displayed on user walls...|$|E
40|$|Some {{problems}} in configurations of network devices {{are difficult to}} identify. Access control lists present {{an important part of}} many configurations. Conflicts among rules of an access control list can cause holes in security policy or quality of service. In this paper we focus on identifying and classifying conflicts among rules of an access control list. Discovering all possible types of conflicts is not a trivial task. We present optimized algorithm for complete access control list analysis using tries, based on existing research by Baboescu and Varghese. The tool for detecting conflicts among access control <b>list</b> <b>rules</b> of one given Cisco, HP or Juniper device using tries based algorithm has been implemented. Bit vectors in tries use WAH compression method to reduce memory consumption. Implemented tool was tested for correctness and performance. The hypothesis that this solution would make the analysis of access lists significantly faster has been proven...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cognitive radio {{offers the}} promise of {{intelligent}} radios that can learn from and adapt to their environment. To date, most cognitive radio {{research has focused on}} policybased radios that are hard-coded with a <b>list</b> <b>rules</b> of how the radio should behave in certain scenarios. Some work has been done on radios with learning engines tailored for very specific applications. This paper describes a concrete model for a generic cognitive radio to utilize a learning engine. The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful. We describe how our generic cognitive engine can tackle problems such as capacity maximization and dynamic spectrum access. I...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{firewalls}} employ <b>listed</b> <b>rules</b> in both configuration {{and process}} phases to regulate network traffic. However, configuring a firewall with <b>listed</b> <b>rules</b> may create rule conflicts, and slows down the firewall. To overcome this problem, we {{have proposed a}} Tree-rule firewall in our previous study. Although the Tree-rule firewall guarantees no conflicts within its rule set and operates faster than traditional firewalls, {{keeping track of the}} state of network connections using hashing functions incurs extra computational overhead. In order to reduce this overhead, we propose a hybrid Tree-rule firewall in this paper. This hybrid scheme takes advantages of both Tree-rule firewalls and traditional listed-rule firewalls. The GUIs of our Tree-rule firewalls are utilized to provide a means for users to create conflict-free firewall rules, which are organized in a tree structure and called 'tree rules'. These tree rules are later converted into <b>listed</b> <b>rules</b> that share the merit of being conflict-free. Finally, in decision making, the <b>listed</b> <b>rules</b> are used to verify against packet header information. The rules which have matched with most packets are moved up to the top positions by the core firewall. The mechanism applied in this hybrid scheme can significantly improve the functional speed of a firewall...|$|R
