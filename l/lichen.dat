5|$|Pilophorus acicularis, {{commonly}} known as the nail <b>lichen</b> or the devil's matchstick, is a species of <b>lichen</b> in the Cladoniaceae family.|$|E
5|$|A <b>lichen</b> is a {{symbiosis}} of a macroscopic fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or cyanobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose <b>lichen,</b> {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the <b>lichen</b> is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the <b>lichen</b> surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.|$|E
50|$|One {{classification}} of Sierra Nevada <b>lichens</b> is according to functional groups, by the National Park Service. These functional groups overlap with each other. These include forage <b>lichens</b> (eaten by animals), nitrogen fixers (can take nitrogen {{molecules from the}} air and attach them to other molecules), acidophiles (acid loving <b>lichens),</b> wolf <b>lichens,</b> crustose <b>lichens</b> on rock, crustose <b>lichens</b> on bark and wood, biotic soil crusts, aquatic <b>lichens,</b> other green algal macrolichens, and pin <b>lichens</b> (calicoids)”. These functional groups overlap. In this article, we include wolf <b>lichens</b> as a subsection of crustose <b>lichens</b> growing on wood.|$|R
50|$|Candelariella is a genus {{of bright}} yellow, ocher, or greenish yellow crustose or squamulose <b>lichens</b> in the Lecanoraceae family. Members {{of the genus}} are {{commonly}} called eggyolk <b>lichens,</b> goldspeck <b>lichens,</b> or yolk <b>lichens.</b>|$|R
50|$|LichensLichens {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by growth form {{and by their}} photosymbiont. Crust <b>lichens</b> include crustose and aerolate <b>lichens</b> that are appressed to the soil substrate, squamulose <b>lichens</b> with scale- or plate-like bodies that are raised above the soils, and foliose <b>lichens</b> with more “leafy” structures that can {{be attached to the}} soil at only one portion. <b>Lichens</b> with algal symbionts can fix atmospheric carbon, while <b>lichens</b> with cyanobacterial symbionts can fix nitrogen as well. <b>Lichens</b> produce many pigments that help protect them from radiation.|$|R
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of <b>lichen</b> in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the <b>lichen</b> forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland <b>lichen</b> {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath <b>lichen.</b> The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the <b>lichen</b> produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair <b>lichen,</b> a striking bright orange <b>lichen</b> that is very sensitive to air pollution. The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|Lichenoid eruptions are dermatoses {{related to}} the unique, common {{inflammatory}} disorder <b>lichen</b> planus, which affects the skin, mucous membranes, nails, and hair.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lichens</b> in {{the genus}} are {{commonly}} called disc <b>lichens,</b> or button <b>lichens.</b> The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 450 species.|$|R
5000|$|Pin <b>lichens,</b> or calicoid <b>lichens,</b> are <b>lichens</b> with a crustose thallus {{and tiny}} fruiting bodies with stalks that {{resemble}} {{the head of}} a pin, whereby the name [...] "pin lichen".|$|R
5|$|The yeast Fellomyces mexicanus, an {{anamorphic}} {{member of}} the Cuniculitremaceae family, was discovered growing epiphytically on the <b>lichen</b> in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The <b>lichen</b> also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the <b>lichen</b> grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 <b>lichen</b> species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The Itcha Range area {{is home to}} a {{grassland}} ecosystem that has not been found elsewhere in southern or central British Columbia. It is dominated by communities of Altai fescue and <b>lichen.</b> Extensive and diverse alpine and subalpine vegetation is also present in the area, some species of which are at the northernmost or southernmost of their range.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lichen</b> has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the <b>lichen</b> state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The <b>lichen</b> is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lichen</b> {{typically}} {{grows on}} silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It is usually in partial shade in openings in low to mid-elevation moist forests, {{and is also}} frequently found in rocky roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|The lichen's cortex and medulla react {{positively}} with potassium hydroxide (K), turning yellow. Cortex and medulla react {{positively with}} para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning yellow. They produce no reaction with calcium or sodium hypochlorite (bleach – C), nor with KC (potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach). Among the substances {{produced by the}} <b>lichen</b> are atranorin and zeorin.|$|E
5|$|The nunatak {{areas have}} a {{scarcity}} of flora, limited to <b>lichen,</b> bryophyte and algae. Flowering plants are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.|$|E
5|$|Adults are in {{reproductive}} diapause and overwinter in {{protected sites}} such as under tree barks, particularly of old, standing trees, hedgerows, <b>lichen,</b> and in forests or leaf litter. At early spring, they can be observed feeding on pollen and nectar of nearby flowers and particularly on Fabacae and Vicia spp.. Some B. rufimanus can survive during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside the seeds and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and emerge from the seeds after sowing.|$|E
50|$|These growth form {{groups are}} not {{precisely}} defined. Foliose <b>lichens</b> may sometimes branch {{and appear to}} be fruticose. Fruticose <b>lichens</b> may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy. Squamulose <b>lichens</b> may appear where the edges lift up. Gelatinous <b>lichens</b> may appear leafy when dry. Means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below.|$|R

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Hokkaido, Clark {{examined}} the local flora and introduced {{new species of}} plants and trees from Japan to the United States. He sent to Massachusetts a large assortment of seeds, many of which proved of special value to his own state, {{on account of the}} high latitude from which they were selected. In Teine-ku, Sapporo, he discovered a new <b>lichen</b> on the side of Mt. Teine, at an elevation of , which was named Cetraria clarkii, in his honor, by Edward Tuckerman.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and <b>lichen</b> accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|Soft olive {{greens are}} also {{achieved}} when textiles dyed yellow {{are treated with}} an iron mordant. The dull green cloth common to the Iron Age Halstatt culture shows traces of iron, and was possibly colored by boiling yellow-dyed cloth in an iron pot. Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau in North America used <b>lichen</b> to dye corn husk bags a sea green.|$|E
