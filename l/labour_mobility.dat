He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes <b>labour</b> <b>mobility,</b> tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{increase in}} part-time working in most OECD countries over {{recent years has}} been accompanied by concerns about the quality of part-time jobs. Most existing research on differences in pay and benefits between full- and part-time work tends to focus on the characteristics of part-time workers and the nature of part-time jobs. However, part-time jobs are more open than full-time employment to the unemployed and other labour market 'outsiders', and such <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility</b> can also influence wages. This paper analyses the effects of workings-time, gender, labour, market segmentation and mobility, on wages and occupational pension benefits in Ireland in 1994. We show that both labour market segmentation and mobility directly influence wages and that controlling for both sets of factors in a wage model eliminates the negative effect of part-time working.

30|$|Summary {{mobility}} {{measures for}} the periods 1998 – 2004 and 2004 – 2008 show {{a decrease in}} <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility</b> over time in the Central Eastern European and Mediterranean countries {{and an increase in}} Continental and Nordic countries. This decline of <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility</b> in the Central Eastern European and Mediterranean countries may stem from a less efficient matching of individuals with jobs than in other countries, as evidenced by an increase in the probability to remain in unemployment. In contrast, in Continental and Mediterranean countries, mobility increased over this period, essentially {{as the result of a}} fall in the probability of remaining in unemployment. All in all, the highest degree of <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility</b> among the countries covered in this paper is consistently observed in Spain, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, with these results mainly reflecting higher mobility of people below the age of 29, highly educated and female workers. We also find that mobility of all worker groups has generally increased over time in Continental Europe and the Nordics.|$|R

The dynamic structural {{of the model}} is assumed to follow a first order Markov process. The data is taken from longitudinal levels of Statistics Canada's Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) and is restricted to males aged 25 to 55 between 1993 and 2004. I examine and discuss the importance of structural and spurious state dependence in three different aspects of <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility.</b> Relevant policy implications are discussed. The first essay compares immigrants and natives in self-employment transitions among four mutually exclusive and exhaustive states of paid-employment, self-employment, unemployment, and being out of the labour force. The second essay explores the factors explaining immigrant-native differences in stability, downward, and upward wage mobility rates. The final essay provides a comprehensive research on earnings dynamics of immigrants and natives within and between Canada and Denmark. This essay also employs Danish administrative registered dataset for the period 1994 - 2003.

30|$|The {{first point}} to {{consider}} is how people move between different labour market states. People can be {{in one of three}} different states {{in the context of the}} labour market – employed, unemployed or inactive. The employed are those who have jobs; the unemployed are looking for jobs; and the inactive are not looking for jobs and are not employed 7. Since people are constantly moving from unemployment to employment, becoming unemployed or leaving the labour market, or becoming inactive, there are constant flows in the labour market, and this is called the <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility</b> 8. Great changes in the economy, such as major reforms or crises, cause an increase in <b>labour</b> market <b>mobility,</b> while there is less movement between various labour market states during stable periods. Flows are indicated by the combination of letters so that EU 9 means movement from employment to unemployment, and IE from inactivity to employment. In total, there are nine possible flows.|$|R
