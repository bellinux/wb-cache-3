5000|$|On 22 November 1976 Catholic {{civilian}} John Toland (35) {{was shot}} and killed by the UDA in the Happy <b>Landing</b> <b>Bar</b> in Derry where he worked as manager. In a statement the loyalists claimed that Toland was killed in retaliation for Corporal William Kidd, an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier killed by republicans in the city four days earlier. The attack came soon after the UDA shot James Loughrey (25) in his Greysteel home. Loughrey died in Altnagelvin Area Hospital on 25 November. Loughrey's shooting was also claimed as a revenge attack, this time for the killing of UDR soldier Ronald Bond on 7 November. The killings would subsequently become central to the [...] "supergrass" [...] trials, as well as subsequent investigations into collusion between paramilitaries and state actors.|$|E

Pye (1966), Schnitzler (1967, 1968), Ajrapetjanz & Konstantinov (1967), and Konstantinov & Sokolov (1969) show that Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum Schreber, 1774 (RF) {{produces}} long pulses of constant frequency {{with a slight}} upward sweep at the start and a downward sweep at the end.

Therefore it is interesting to compare the sound emission of both species in a similar orientation situation, while flying from a starting place across a room to a <b>landing</b> <b>bar.</b> The flight distance was 6. 5 m in RF and 2. 4 m in CR.

The immigrants would then come into the United States through the Canada-United States border. During the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the Canadian immigration route was preferred for Scandinavians, Russians, and other northern Europeans immigrating to Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, or other states on the Upper Great Plains.
