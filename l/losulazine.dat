40|$|Groups of 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were treated}} orally with <b>losulazine</b> at 0 (vehicle control), 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg/day for 1 year. Daily {{clinical}} signs, weekly food consumption and body weight changes, and terminal hematologic and blood chemistry values were evaluated. Terminal urinalysis in 10 randomly selected rats from all groups {{and levels of}} serum luetinizing hormone, prolactin, and testosterone from control, low-, and high-dose groups were also evaluated. Fertility was determined in eight randomly selected rats from each group at 35 - 49 weeks. Reversibility of breeding performance was evaluated in 10 rats treated for 30 weeks and allowed to recover for 17 weeks. Selected organs were weighed and the testes and epididymides were microscopically evaluated in all rats that survived through the 1 year treatment period. Rats treated with <b>losulazine</b> showed dosage-dependent ptosis, somnolence, fecal softening, and decreased food consumption with a corresponding retarded body weight gain. There were no biologically significant changes in hematologic, blood chemistry, or urinalysis values between treated and control rats. Relative spleen, heart, adrenal, an...|$|E
