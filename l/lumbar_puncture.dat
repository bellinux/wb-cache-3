5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> <b>Lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> {{can also}} be {{performed}} to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{diagnostic}} procedures, such as <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> (see post-dural-puncture headache), venipuncture, paracentesis, and thoracentesis can be painful.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{meningococcal}} meningitis {{is described in}} a patient who had not received antibiotics before admission. Three <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> were performed over a seven-day period, but only the cerebrospinal fluid from the third yielded a positive culture. The importance of repeated <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> in patients with undiagnosed meningitis is emphasized...|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} can {{be repeated}} if necessary, {{but this is}} generally taken as a clue that additional treatments {{may be required to}} control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> {{may also}} be done to inject {{medications}} into the cerebrospinal fluid ("intrathecally"), particularly for spinal anesthesia or chemotherapy.|$|R
5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|Repeating the <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> {{during the}} disease course is not recommended. The protein levels may rise after {{treatment}} has been administered.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors include}} being {{overweight}} or a recent increase in weight. Tetracycline may also trigger the condition. The diagnosis {{is based on}} symptoms and a high intracranial pressure founding during a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> with no specific cause found on a brain scan.|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} survey {{of children with}} haemophilus and pneumococcal meningitis was carried out to assess the significance of persistent CSF pleocytosis {{and the need for}} repeat <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> after adequate treatment. Persistent pleocytosis was noted in 9 of 27 patients with haemophilus meningitis; this tended to be present in those with higher initial CSF white blood counts and lower initial CSF glucose contents. No sequelae were noted in those with persistent pleocytosis. Repeat <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> were not of clinical benefit and tended to result in longer treatment which was not warranted...|$|R
50|$|Follow-up {{blood tests}} are {{generally}} performed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months {{to make sure}} the infection is gone. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> for CSF fluid analysis are generally performed every 6 months.|$|R
2500|$|Management of ALL is {{directed}} towards control of bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease. Additionally, treatment must prevent leukemic cells from spreading to other sites, particularly {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) e.g. monthly <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures.</b> In general, ALL treatment is divided into several phases: ...|$|R
5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} {{a person with}} a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot, however, be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in symptom control is {{drainage}} of cerebrospinal fluid by <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> If necessary, this may be performed {{at the same time}} as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> (LPs) are {{frequently}} {{performed in the}} paediatric medical emergency unit (MEU) department to diagnose or exclude meningitis. Unsuccessful <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> (LPs) cause diagnostic uncertainty which may prolong hospital stay and result in unnecessary antibiotic treatment and increased costs {{to the hospital and}} patients. It is important to determine factors that may be effective in reducing unsuccessful LPs. There is a paucity of studies on this topic from sub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies have shown inconsistent results and the use of sedation has not previously been studied. Aims: To determine the prevalence of unsuccessful lumbar punctures(LPs) and the factors influencing this in the medical emergency unit (MEU) and short stay ward (SSW) at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town...|$|R
50|$|Fungal meningitis, such as cryptococcal meningitis, {{is treated}} with long courses of high dose antifungals, such as {{amphotericin}} B and flucytosine. Raised intracranial pressure {{is common in}} fungal meningitis, and frequent (ideally daily) <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> to relieve the pressure are recommended, or alternatively a lumbar drain.|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure with normal CSF composi-tion and {{no evidence of}} hydrocephalus or mass lesion. We describe the anesthetic management of a parturient with IIH who required multiple <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> during pregnancy and delivery secondary to worsening neurological symp-toms...|$|R
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E
5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} {{tubercular meningitis}} by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatments}} include repeated <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> {{to remove}} excess spinal fluid in the cranium. The removal of potentially causative medicines including tetracyclines and vitamin A analogues may help decrease ICP; however, {{this is only}} necessary if the medication is truly felt {{to contribute to the}} ICP increase.|$|R
2500|$|Ordered {{investigations}} [...] "without {{the requisite}} paediatric qualifications" [...] including colonoscopies, colon biopsies and <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> ("spinal taps") on his research subjects without {{the approval of}} his department's ethics board and contrary to the children's clinical interests, when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history.|$|R
50|$|Direct trauma {{can also}} cause cauda equina syndrome. Most common causes include {{iatrogenic}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures,</b> burst fractures resulting in posterior migration of fragments of the vertebral body, severe disc herniations, spinal anaesthesia involving trauma from catheters and high local anaesthetic concentrations around the cauda equina, penetrating trauma such as knife wounds or ballistic trauma.|$|R
5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{description}} of development of optic drusen in related children with pseudopapilloedema. 4, 5 We found that reassuring symptomatology, the absence of optic nerve-sheath swelling on B-scans and a positive family history of pseudopapilloedema to be very helpful in excluding serious intracranial pathology, as well as reducing the need for <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> and CT scans...|$|R
40|$|The lumbar {{tap test}} as a {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic procedure in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is used widely. Complications from <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> are rare. We report {{a man who}} underwent a tap-test for secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus, and after clinical improvement, suffered a fatal intraparenchymal brain haemorrhage three days later. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|The fluid then flows {{around the}} {{superior}} sagittal sinus to be reabsorbed via the arachnoid granulations [...] (or arachnoid villi) into the venous sinuses, after which {{it passes through}} the jugular vein and major venous system. CSF within the spinal cord can flow {{all the way down}} to the lumbar cistern at the end of the cord around the cauda equina where <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> are performed.|$|R
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{sample is}} also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid. This {{can be determined}} by spectrophotometry (measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light) or visual examination. It is unclear which method is superior. Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between {{the onset of the}} headache and <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.|$|E
50|$|Culturing for {{microorganisms}} from {{a sample}} of CSF, blood or urine, is the gold standard test for definitive diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. This can give false negatives due to the low sensitivity of culture methods and because of concomitant antibiotic therapy. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> should be done when possible as 10-15% presenting with sepsis also have meningitis, which warrants an antibiotic with a high CSF penetration.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{impact of}} serial <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> on {{association}} between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of opening pressure with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD 4 cell count. DESIGN: Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa. METHODS: Study protocols required four <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> with measurements of opening pressure {{over the first}} 2 weeks of treatment and additional <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> if opening pressure raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD 4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by opening pressure at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline opening pressure. High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high pressure. Baseline opening pressure {{was not associated with}} CD 4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status. Day 14 opening pressure was associated with day 14 fungal burden. Overall mortality was 12 % (20 / 162) at 2 weeks and 26 % (42 / 160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between opening pressure groups. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised opening pressure. Aggressive management of raised opening pressure through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised opening pressure on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. The results support increasing access to manometers in resource-poor settings and routine management of opening pressure in patients with cryptococcal meningitis...|$|R
