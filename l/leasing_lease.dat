40|$|The article {{studies the}} {{valuation}} and optimal management of Time Charters with Purchase Options (T/C-POPs), {{which is a}} specific type of asset lease with embedded options that is common in shipping markets. T/C-POPs are economically significant and sometimes account {{for more than half of}} the stock market value of listed shipping companies. The main source of risk in markets for maritime transportation is the freight rate, and we therefore specify a single-factor continuous time model for the dynamic evolution of freight rates that allows us to price a wide variety of freight rate-related derivatives including various forms of T/C-POPs using contingent claims valuation techniques. Our model allows for the derivation of closed valuation formulas for some simple freight rate derivatives, whereas the more complex ones are analysed using numerical (finite difference) procedures. We accompany our theoretical results with illustrative numerical examples as we proceed. Ship valuation, options on ships, <b>leasing,</b> <b>lease</b> contracts with options, optimal stopping,...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that <b>leasing</b> is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit. The key aspect is the proper use of capital resources: the investment of money in what generates „business” and brings profit, like publicity, the superior qualification of the staff, stocks, exploring new markets, research, development, instead of blocking them by purchasing fixed assets. This article aims to approach the <b>leasing</b> as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a <b>lease</b> - the lessee or the user of the <b>lease,</b> the lessee or the <b>leasing</b> company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject <b>lease.</b> There are also the main modern forms of <b>leasing</b> which are more common in business finance. <b>leasing,</b> investment, lessor, financial <b>leasing,</b> operating <b>leasing,</b> full pay out <b>leasing,</b> cross-border <b>leasing,</b> buy and <b>lease,</b> sale and <b>lease</b> back, cession-bail, <b>leasing</b> adosse, experimental <b>leasing,</b> time-sharing <b>leasing,</b> renting, credit-bail d’actions, master <b>leasing,</b> wet-lease, leveraged <b>lease.</b> ...|$|R

Using a game-theoretic variant of real options analysis, the underlying real estate asset market is modeled as a continuous-time Nash equilibrium in which developers make construction decisions under demand uncertainty. Then, using the economic notion that <b>leasing</b> simply represents the purchase of the use of the asset over a specified time frame, I use a contingent-claims approach to value many of the most common real estate <b>leasing</b> arrangements. In particular, the model provides closed-form solutions for the equilibrium valuation of <b>leases</b> with options to purchase, pre-leasing, gross and net <b>leases,</b> <b>leases</b> with cancellation options, ground <b>leases,</b> escalation clauses, <b>lease</b> concessions and sale-leasebacks. ...|$|R
