40|$|Annotations are {{a broadly}} useful {{mechanism}} that can support {{a number of}} useful document management applications (third-party commentary, design rationale, information filtering, and semantic <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> document <b>content</b> to name a few).

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} examine the ﬂuoride {{concentration}} of commercially available bottled water products in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and to assess the accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> ﬂuoride concentration on the tested brands. Methods: Fifteen randomly selected commercial brands of bottled water were obtained from supermarkets in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Three bottles of each brand were purchased, and ﬂuoride contentwas measured using a combination ﬂuoride-ion-selective electrode. The average reading for each brand was estimated and also compared with the ﬂuoride content printed on the label. Results: The mean (±SD) ﬂuoride <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the 12 local bottled water samples was 0. 79 (± 0. 09) mg/L with a range from 0. 5 to 0. 83 mg/L.

40|$|The {{taxation}} of unhealthy {{food products}} and the mandatory <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> key nutrients {{may help to}} curve the growth of obesity and related metabolic risk factors. This paper {{is the first to}} propose ex ante evaluations of these policy options. To this end, we study the French market for fromages blanc and dessert yogurts, which is characterized by an exogenous variation in legal labeling requirements across products. This is used to identify separately the consumer preferences for fat-content labels and for fat in a structural demand model that is estimated from household scanner panel data. The estimated demand functions are then combined with a structural supply model to evaluate the impact of fat policies on several market outcomes. An ad-valorem tax of 10 % on the producer price of full-fat products is shown to result in a 9 % fall in fat purchases, whereas the mandatory <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> fat <b>content</b> produces a 1. 5 % decrease only. This is explained by the producer price responses, which neutralize up to 96 % of the impact <b>of</b> mandatory <b>labeling</b> on consumer demand...|$|R

Thus, no <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> or the rotation angle of the object is needed when adding new images to the database. This is particularly important when using query by sketch due to the skew which occurs naturally in human handwriting and in drawings.
