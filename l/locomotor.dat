5|$|<b>Locomotor</b> {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. <b>Locomotor</b> postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these <b>locomotor</b> types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of <b>locomotor</b> behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow {{climbing}} like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with <b>locomotor</b> superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|In this research, we varied the {{composition}} of 4 -member groups. One third of the groups consisted exclusively of "locomotors," individuals predominantly oriented toward action. Another third of the groups consisted exclusively of "assessors," individuals predominantly oriented toward evaluation. The final third of the groups consisted of a mix of <b>locomotors</b> and assessors. We found that the groups containing only <b>locomotors</b> were faster than the groups containing only assessors, and the groups containing only assessors were more accurate than the groups containing only <b>locomotors.</b> The groups containing a mix of assessors and <b>locomotors</b> were {{as fast as the}} groups containing only <b>locomotors</b> and as accurate as the groups containing only assessors. These results echo findings at the individual level of analysis, and suggest that the testing and action components of operating systems independently contribute to performance both intra- and interpersonally...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} self-produced {{locomotion}} on {{physical and social}} environments, affect, discipline, and compliance was examined. Forty, 6 -month-old, prelocomotor infants and their mothers were initially contacted. At age 8 -months, <b>locomotors</b> (13 males, 7 females) could move forward 3 feet in under 30 seconds unassisted. Prelocomotors (13 males, 7 females) were matched by age and sex with the <b>locomotors.</b> At both occasions, parents were interviewed about their children 2 ̆ 7 s physical abilities, social interactions, and emergent discipline and filled out the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ). An observation of the parent-child dyad in an office also occurred during the second contact. Compared to prelocomotors, interview reports revealed environmental changes over time in that <b>locomotors</b> spent more time playing on the floor, had a wider interest in toys, and were subject to increased child-proofing in their homes. Moreover, <b>locomotors</b> displayed greater affection toward mothers than prelocomotors at both contacts. Separation distress peaked for all children as they neared the transition to locomotion but <b>locomotors</b> {{were more likely to}} maintain physical contact with their caregivers. Observed affect revealed no differences among groups but interviews indicated all children displayed more emotions, especially negative ones, over time. Boys reportedly showed more emotions than girls, most noticeably other-oriented emotions. IBQ scales revealed that distress to limitations increased over time for all children while soothability decreased for <b>locomotors</b> and increased for prelocomotors. Positive correlations between time one and time two interview questions revealed consistency in individuals 2 ̆ 7 affect over time as did IBQ scales. Within the observation, reactive discipline was more often used with <b>locomotors,</b> especially the use of “no,” but no group differences existed for proactive discipline measures. Furthermore, maternal reports indicated increased use of prohibition with their <b>locomotors</b> including verbal prohibitions, facial expressions, physical restraint, removal of objects, and distractions with alternate objects. Observations of compliance were inconclusive. Changes in the examined variables coincided with the onset of locomotion but it appears that not all changes resulted from this transition. ...|$|R

5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic <b>locomotor</b> research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy, which could have improved <b>locomotor</b> efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of CPG, control by brain as it happens in {{complete}} spinal cord injury, sensory feedback {{is very important in}} generating rhythmic locomotion. Firstly, <b>locomotor</b> movements can be initiated or blocked by some proprioceptive afferent inputs. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for <b>locomotor</b> rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it. Secondly, proprioceptive afferents may participate in adapting walking speed, in determining overall cycle duration, and in regulating the structure of the step cycle’s subphases (i.e., swing, stance), which is required for speed adaptation and interlimb coupling. Thirdly, proprioceptive afferents are involved in setting the level of muscle activity through various reflex pathways.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} {{converts}} androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively. According {{to the role}} of testosterone and zinc in reducing anxiety and the relation between androgenic system function and zinc supplementations, in this research, the effect of zinc chloride injection was analysed in rats which aromatase enzyme was inhibited by aromatase inhibitor (letrozole). Materials and Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (weighing 225 ± 25 g) were used. Animals were divided into 12 groups and based on their weight, aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) was injected (subcutaneously), and 30 minutes later, ZnCl 2 or its solvent (saline) was injected intra-peritoneal. Control group was received both solvents (DMSO and saline) respectively. Anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze 30 minutes after the last injection, and thereafter, open field was used for measurement of the <b>locomotors</b> activity of animals. Results: The results showed a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in open arms in letrozole (1. 25 mg/kg) treated group as compared to that of solvent group. The <b>locomotors</b> activity significantly decreased between letrozole (1. 25 mg/kg) with the control group. The combined groups received letrozole (2. 5 mg/kg) and different amounts of zinc chloride (2. 5, 5, 10 mg/kg), significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) the percentage of time spent in the open arm, comparing to the control group. Groups that received the combination of zinc chloride (2. 5 mg/kg) and different amounts of letrozole (1. 25, 5, 10 mg/kg), showed {{no significant difference in the}} percentage of entry and time spent in the open arms. Conclusion: Totally, the present study suggests that letrozole alone increased anxiety and decreased <b>locomotors</b> activity and could interfere with anxiolytic effect of ZnCl 2 as well. ...|$|R

25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in <b>locomotor</b> pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for <b>locomotor</b> rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E

Bioinspired strategies for synchronizing the movement of the parapodia with the body undulations, emulating organisms like the centipedes and the polychaete worms, are presented, giving rise to distinct pedundulatory modes. These modes are investigated and comparatively assessed, both in simulation and via experiments with the Nereisbot prototype locomoting on sand and on several other unstructured substrates. Our studies demonstrate the rich gait repertoire and enhanced performance of pedundulatory systems, compared to purely undulatory ones...|$|R
