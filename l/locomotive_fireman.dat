He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken <b>locomotive</b> <b>fireman</b> failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the main dam at Scar House finally severed the line to Angram in 1933. By 1936, with construction completed, the railway was lifted, and a sale was held at Pateley Bridge on 1 March 1937, where everything was sold as a single lot. The staff of the Nidd Valley Light Railway were laid off, and although their jobs did not qualify for a pension, pensions were paid to G Pearson, {{who had worked for}} the company as a locomotive driver for 30 years, and to J Brown, who had been a platelayer for 20 years. Pensions were also to be paid to another platelayer and the <b>locomotive</b> <b>fireman</b> on reaching the age of 65. At its peak, the Scar House reservoir project had employed about 780 men, and the population of Scar Village had been 1,135. By 1936, there were just eight houses occupied, and seven pupils at the school, which closed on 31 January 1938.|$|E
50|$|A <b>locomotive's</b> <b>fireman</b> {{worked in}} a tandem with the train's engineer, serving in a {{subordinate}} role as his assistant. Firemen were in practice often engineers-in-training, learning the skills of train operation and assisting the engineer with the observation of signals and other routine aspects of his job performance, waiting for a job opportunity for promotion.|$|R
500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} all Coronation Class tenders {{was that they}} were fitted with a steam-operated coal pusher to bring the coal down to the firing plate. When this was in {{operation}} a plume of steam could be seen rising from the rear face of the coal bunker backwall. This equipment greatly helped the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>fireman</b> to meet the high demands for power during the non-stop run of [...] between London Euston and Glasgow Central, when operating the Coronation Scot train.|$|R
50|$|The Railway {{is fully}} {{operated}} by volunteers. These volunteers {{come from all}} walks of life and have diverse and varied interests within the railway. Trackwork enthusiasts can lead a hand on a Wednesday work train, however the majority of work occurs on Saturdays where activities range from shunting movements to engineering. Complimentary training is offered in both correspondence form, and through one-on-one and group lecturing. No fees occur (except for the issue of steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>firemans</b> and drivers certificate, assessed by an external examiner) for these services.|$|R
2500|$|Clark {{was born}} in the town of Fowler in Otero County, Colorado, in 1906. [...] He was the son of Harry J. Clark (1874–1924), a Michigan native, and Mary Etta (Lackey) Clark (1876–1969), a North Carolina native. Clark had an older sister, Mabel May (1899–1990), two older brothers, Carl (1901–1927) and Fred (1903–1942), and a younger sister, Pearl (1919–2003). As of 1910, the family lived in La Junta, Otero County, where the father was a farmer. In 1917, when Dutch was 10 years old, the family moved {{approximately}} 60 miles to the west to Pueblo, Colorado, where the father was employed as a <b>locomotive</b> <b>fireman</b> on a steam railroad.|$|E
2500|$|VR's three-cylinder S class 4-6-2 steam {{locomotives}} {{were assigned}} to haul the train, which typically had an eleven-car trailing load of , over the 1 in 50 gradients between Melbourne and Albury. Although the locomotives had been in service since 1928, their appearance was dramatically altered {{with the addition of}} streamlining, along with royal blue and gold livery designed to seamlessly match the carriages of the train. The locomotives were also equipped with long range tenders, with enough water and coal capacity to enable the train to travel the entire [...] journey between Albury and Melbourne non-stop, at an average speed of , a schedule that was the longest non-stop train journey in Australia, and held the record as the fastest for the next twenty years. Until the conversion of the S class locomotives to oil firing (which commenced from February 1951), the <b>locomotive</b> <b>fireman</b> was charged with the formidable task of shovelling six to seven tons of coal into the firebox during the course of each journey, in order to generate enough power to maintain the schedule.|$|E

Dick never learned much more about his past than this, but their acquaintance ripened and Kemp proved a useful friend.|$|E
5000|$|The FT was {{discontinued}} in late 1945, {{replaced in}} production by the F2, which retained the [...] {{rating of the}} FT, but with upgraded electrical and control equipment. Additionally, the mechanically-driven cooling fans, which required constant tending by the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>fireman,</b> were replaced with electrically-driven fans which were automatically controlled, a system which is still in use to this day. The F2 was produced only in 1946, and afterward was replaced by updated models in the EMD F-unit series, such as the F3, F7, and F9.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Locomotive</b> Assistant (<b>fireman)s</b> duty is {{to assist}} the driver with the safe and {{efficient}} operation of the locomotive.

5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The <b>locomotive's</b> <b>fireman</b> managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|R

5000|$|Control {{cars have}} been in use in the United Kingdom for many decades, with the Great Western Railway often using [...] "autocoaches" [...] on branch line services. These allowed a train driver to {{remotely}} control the regulator and reverser of a suitably equipped <b>locomotive.</b> The <b>fireman</b> remained on the locomotive to operate the boiler and locomotive whistle. Locomotives were commonly sandwiched between a pair of autocoaches, allowing a maximum of four to be used.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the <b>locomotive,</b> and the <b>fireman</b> on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the steam brake valve at one end.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the barrels}} broke {{up in the}} collision, and their {{contents}} caught fire. The engine, tender, guard’s van and the first three passenger carriages were instantly enveloped in dense smoke and flames, which soon spread to the fourth carriage and {{the front of the}} leading post office van. This prevented any immediate attempt to rescue the occupants of the first four carriages, who all died, together with the guard in the front guard’s van and the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>fireman.</b> [...] "We were startled by a collision and a shock. ... I immediately jumped out of the carriage, when a fearful sight met my view. Already the three passenger carriages in front of ours, the vans and the engine were enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully 20 feet. ... It was the work of an instant. No words can convey the instantaneous nature of the explosion and conflagration. I had actually got out almost before the shock of the collision was over, and this was the spectacle which already presented itself. Not a sound, not a scream, not a struggle to escape, or a movement of any sort was apparent in the doomed carriages. It was as though an electric flash had at once paralysed and stricken every one of their occupants. So complete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling life in them that ... it was imagined that the burning carriages were destitute of passengers." ...|$|R

50|$|Fireman or stoker is the {{job title}} for someone {{whose job is to}} tend the fire for the running of a steam engine. On steam <b>locomotives</b> the term <b>fireman</b> is usually used, while on steamships and {{stationary}} steam engines, such as those driving saw mills, the term is usually stoker (although the British Merchant Navy did use fireman). The German word Heizer is equivalent and in Dutch the word stoker is mostly used too. The United States Navy referred to them as watertenders. Much of the job is hard physical labor, such as shoveling fuel, typically coal, into the engine's firebox.|$|R
50|$|Each {{train is}} manned by {{a total of}} four associates; an Engineer, Fireman, Front Conductor, and Back Conductor (position of back {{conductor}} may be eliminated with the operation of a scaled down train of three passenger cars, rather than the regular six). The Engineer {{is in charge of the}} operation of the <b>locomotive,</b> while the <b>Fireman</b> watches over the boiler pressure levels, and maintains the fire and water levels in the boiler. The Front Conductor is in the charge of the movement of the train, as well as the entertainment and wellbeing of the passengers aboard. Additionally, each station must be manned by a Station Master who is responsible for the safety of passengers in the station, helping passengers load and unload, as well as keeping capacity.|$|R
50|$|Fireless {{locomotives}} {{are also}} safer to operate than conventional steam locomotives, {{aside from the}} elimination of ignition hazards. The primary cause of a locomotive boiler explosion is the depletion of boiler water, through inattention or excessive use, exposing the crown sheet directly to the flames of the firebox, weakening it {{to the point of}} failure. A fireless locomotive eliminates this danger—if it runs out of sufficient water, it simply ceases to move—although precautions must be taken as with any other pressure vessel. Furthermore, they did not require careful monitoring of water levels and boiler pressure, nor careful distribution of coal in the firebox for efficient combustion, and thus could be operated by less-skilled staff, not requiring a fully qualified <b>locomotive</b> engineer and <b>fireman.</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of February 6, 1871, at the {{drawbridge}} in New Hamburg that crosses Wappinger Creek - where northbound trains pass from Wappinger into the town of Poughkeepsie - the Hudson River Pacific Express crashed into a passing freight train, which had broken an axle. There were 22 confirmed deaths, but while some bodies were taken to Poughkeepsie for identification, others were never recovered. On September 1, 1892, at the same location, a mail train on the Hudson River Railroad derailed. The draw had been opened to let the small steamer Young America pass through, and was being closed when the train came northward. A gap of several feet remained when the engine reached the draw. The engine jumped the gap, but the rear end of the tender dropped enough to stop {{the progress of the}} train; then, the mail car, crashing into the tender, pushed it against the <b>locomotive.</b> The engineer, <b>fireman,</b> and mail clerk were all killed.|$|R
5000|$|Steam Incorporated has {{operated}} or participated in excursions to almost {{all parts of}} the national railway network that has been open since the late 1970s. As one of the first organisations to operate a private carriage fleet, excursions have been run since 1978. During {{the early years of the}} society's existence, NZR would not permit heritage operators to use their own locomotives on the national network, thus limiting the society's locomotive activities to the area of The Engine Shed. Since 1985 however, this policy has been abandoned and Steam Incorporated have run the majority of their excursions using society owned Steam and Diesel locomotives. Popular excursions have been through the central North Island, annual [...] "Art Deco" [...] expresses to Napier, to the centennial celebrations at Dunedin Railway Station in 2006, and to the centennial celebrations at Feilding in 2008.
