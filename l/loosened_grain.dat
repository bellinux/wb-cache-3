40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of industrial round-wood (IRW) losses associated with most applicable motor-manual (MM) and fully mechanized (FM) harvesting systems in Russia. Observations were made for five harvesting systems, namely cut-to-length (MM CTL and FM CTL), full-tree (MM FT and FM FT), and tree length (MM TL), during the felling, skidding/forwarding, processing, sorting, and loading operations. Damage to IRW was examined in 15 logging companies in Karelia. There were about 23 400 measured logs in 17 harvesting sites during summer and winter seasons. The damages detected were broken down into four groups: mechanical damage, processing defects, contamination with dirt, and deviations from the desired log dimensions. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements in a given logging company, and the IRW volume loss was determined {{in terms of the}} reject rate and value loss per unit volume {{in the context of a}} harvesting system. Mechanical damage (torn and <b>loosened</b> <b>grain,</b> cuts in stemwood, and gouges made by grapples), processing defects (branches, log end splits and cracks) and contamination with dirt were the most frequent types of damage. The MMCTL and FM CTL systems provided the minimum losses (the reject rate was 2 % of observed logs and 0. 5 – 0. 6 € per m 3 of total industrial wood). The FT systems resulted in somewhat lower but still acceptable quality (MM: 4 % and € 1. 1; FM: 3 % and € 0. 9). The quality of wood harvested with the MMTL system turned out to be the lowest (5 %and € 1. 4), especially in the summer season. The total annual losses in IRW value at the companies studied were estimated as 1. 0 € per IRW m 3 or € 1. 8 million...|$|E
30|$|Wood {{is widely}} used in {{industrial}} products such as furniture and structural members. The constant use of wood in industry, however, has been sometimes disturbed by the fluctuation of physical properties in wood because this fluctuation may cause defects in the wood products.

Weak zones in fins were either dissolved by naturally occurring acids in rainwater or wedged apart by freezing and thawing water, and openings developed into the various arches seen presently.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{situations}} specific for the Netherlands are explained. First: In the Netherlands {{there is an}} increasing attention {{for the use of}} claddings made of planed softwood without or with a semi transparent coating. Because of our way of building and our climatical circumstances, frequently <b>loosening</b> <b>grain</b> and raising grain appear. The paper summarises the causes of both phenomenons as distinguished by a national research group. Second: Large quantities of single timber species for the use in water building constructions and joinery are no longer available and alternatives have to be found. In the Netherlands the number of timber species used did and will increase. The Dutch experience dealing with the introduction of relatively unknown species like tropical hardwoods is discussed. Third: The Netherlands is famous because of all the buildings standing on wooden foundation piles and during the last decade new knowledge was gathered on the processes of decay specific for this type of constructions. The paper will summarise these new achievements which enable us to predict more specific the degradation velocities in relation to location.

50|$|Byader Park is {{used for}} {{religious}} activities and athletic events. This land used to be owned by several farmers’ families. At this location the farmers used to beat {{the head of the}} wheat stalk with a club like tool to <b>loosen</b> the <b>grain,</b> then throw it into the air. The lighter chaff material blew away further on the ground than the grain which was heavier. The grain was then collected and sold at the local mill. Over the years, they donated their ownership in this land to the interest of the town.|$|R
25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) <b>loosen.</b> The <b>grain</b> hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|R
40|$|Discrete {{underground}} drainage conduits in quartz sandstones {{are far less}} common than in limestones. This paper provides field evidence from the quartzose Precipice Sandstone in the Carnarvon Range of south-central Queensland, Australia, for tubular {{underground drainage}} networks similar inmanyways to limestone conduits. Diameters range from less than 1 or 2 cm to over 1. 5 m, most display a near-circular to oval cross-section that seems to suggest phreatic or epiphreatic development, and the internal surfaces of many are case-hardened by secondary silica deposits. A number of the region 2 ̆ 7 s perennial springs appear to be fed by such tubes. The dominant vertical jointing of the quartz sandstone and relatively high permeability of the sandstone are important controls on tube formation. Solutionalweathering of the sandstone is widespread, and {{is followed by the}} removal of <b>loosened</b> sand <b>grains</b> by flowing underground water, the process of ‘arenisation’. Tube developmentwould appear to have been happening for a very long time, and maystill be occurring. A model for tube network formation is proposed. These findings highlight our potentially poor understanding of groundwater flow within some quartz sandstones, and may have important groundwater management implications...|$|R
5000|$|Native Americans {{had been}} using ground corn (maize) for food {{thousands}} of years before European explorers arrived in the New World.European settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread {{has been called a}} [...] "cornerstone" [...] of the Cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A coarser meal (compare flour) made from corn is grits. Grits are produced by soaking raw corn grains in hot water containing calcium hydroxide (an alkaline salt), which <b>loosens</b> the <b>grain</b> hulls (bran) and increases the nutritional value of the product (by increasing available niacin and available amino acids). These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy. Hominy, posole in Spanish, also is ground into masa harina for tamales and tortillas. This ancient Native American technology has been named nixtamalization. Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean chicha). Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different forms—high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried (as unleavened pone, corn fritters, hoecakes, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{failure mechanisms}} around boreholes {{and the formation}} of borehole breakouts in high-porosity sandstone, with particular interest to grain-scale micromechanics of failure leading to the hitherto unrecognized fracture-like borehole breakouts and apparent compaction band formation in poorly consolidated granular materials. We also looked at a variety of drilling-related factors that contribute to the type, size and shape of borehole breakouts. The objective was to assess their effect on the ability to establish correlations between breakout geometry and in situ stress magnitudes, as well as on borehole stability prediction, and hydrocarbon/water extraction in general. We identified two classes of medium to high porosity (12 - 30 %) sandstones, arkosic, consisting of 50 - 70 % quartz and 15 to 50 % feldspar, and quartz-rich sandstones, in which quartz grain contents varied from 90 to 100 %. In arkose sandstones critical far-field stress magnitudes induced compressive failure around boreholes in the form of V-shaped (dog-eared) breakouts, the result of dilatant intra-and trans-granular microcracking subparallel to both the maximum horizontal far-field stress and to the borehole wall. On the other hand, boreholes in quartz-rich sandstones failed by developing fracture-like breakouts. These are long and very narrow (several grain diameters) tabular failure zones perpendicular to the maximum stress. Evidence provided mainly by SEM observations suggests a failure process initiated by localized grain-bond loosening along the least horizontal far-field stress springline, the packing of these grains into a lower porosity compaction band resembling those discovered in Navajo and Aztec sandstones, and the emptying of the <b>loosened</b> <b>grains</b> by the circulating drilling fluid starting from the borehole wall. Although the immediate several grain layers at the breakout tip often contain some cracked or even crushed grains, the failure mechanism enabled by the formation of the compaction band is largely non-dilatant, a major departure from the dilatant mechanism observed in Tablerock sandstone. The experimental results suggest that unlike our previous assertion, the strength of grain bonding and the mineral composition, rather than the porosity, are major factors in the formation of compaction bands and the ensuing fracture-like breakouts. Some breakout dimensions in all rocks were correlatable to the far-field principal stresses, and could potentially be used (in conjunction with other information) as indicators of their magnitudes. However, we found that several factors can significantly influence breakout geometry. Larger boreholes and increased drilling-fluid flow rates produce longer fracture-like breakouts, suggesting that breakouts in field-scale wellbores could reach considerable lengths. On the other hand, increased drilling-fluid weight and increased drill-bit penetration rate resulted in a decrease in breakout length. These results indicate that breakout growth can be controlled to some degree by manipulating drilling variables. Realizing how drilling variables impact borehole breakout formation is important in understanding the process by which breakouts form and their potential use as indicators of the far-field in situ stress magnitudes and as sources of sand production. As our research indicates, the final breakout size and mechanism of formation can be a function of several variables and conditions, meaning there is still much to be understood about this phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|It {{is usually}} made from {{two or more}} large sticks {{attached}} by a short chain; one stick is held and swung, causing the other (the swipple) to strike a pile of <b>grain,</b> <b>loosening</b> the husks. The precise dimensions and shape of flails were determined by generations of farmers to suit the particular grain they were harvesting. For example, flails used by farmers in Quebec to process wheat were generally made from two pieces of wood, the handle being about 1.5 m long by 3 cm in diameter, and the second stick being about 1 m long by about 3 cm in diameter, with a slight taper towards the end. Flails for other grains, such as rice or spelt, would have had different dimensions.Flails have generally fallen into disuse in many nations because {{of the availability of}} technologies such as combine harvesters that require much less manual labour.

40|$|The Petra monumental site {{is located}} on the left rim of the Rift Valley in central-southern Jordan. The entire valley, which is tectonic in origin, rests on Late Cambrian quartzarenite rock {{formations}} of continental origin. Past research conducted by our team has allowed us to identify the following main causes of the weathering processes: thermal expansion and shrinkage of rocks caused by the great differences in day and night temperatures contribute to the <b>loosening</b> of quartz <b>grains</b> that lead to the disintegration of the rock. Heavy rainfall and above all surface runoff contribute significantly to the removal of weathered materials from the surface. Other forms of decay are caused by the presence of salts along the fractures. Both fieldwork and laboratory analyses performed in the past in a climate chamber have demonstrated that the products usually used in conventional restoration work are not very effective, due to the “extreme” climate and the chemical and physical characteristics of the rocks. The project proposes the realization of a GIS aimed at acquiring complete knowledge of the man-made structures and hydraulic system underlying the routes of the canalisations and identifying the cisterns. This work is meant to contribute a valid support aimed at the restoration, which will involve several different disciplines, including the geological and chemical analysis of the rocks, the topography and the 3 D photogrammetry...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{underground}} facilities for purposes such as transportation tunnels, power station caverns, radioactive waste repositories, {{and water and}} gas storage is increasing. Fracturing is a failure mechanism of brittle rocks that is of great importance to their performance for underground facilities. A major challenge in rock fracture mechanics research at its current stage of development is the extrapolation of parameter values measured at laboratory-scale on small, intact rock specimens to large-scale jointed rock masses. Understanding crack growth is therefore very important for assessing the stability of rock masses/materials and for the safe design of structures within rock masses. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the tensile strength parameters of rocks, such as the indirect tensile strength and fracture toughness value, under monotonic static and cyclic loading conditions. The indirect tensile strength of rocks was initially investigated using the standard Brazilian test. However, this was found to crush the brittle rocks tested, and steel loading arcs of different angles were assessed to obtain more reliable diametral tensile splitting cracks in disc specimens, as expected theoretically. The maximum recorded ultimate load and most appropriate tensile splitting crack was obtained with a loading arc angle 2 α = 30. However, the highest standard deviation of the ultimate load {{was obtained from the}} standard Brazilian test results. The most fundamental parameter in fracture mechanics is the fracture toughness, which describes the resistance of a material to crack propagation. Fracture toughness is an important material parameter that corresponds to the critical state of the stress intensity factor required for crack initiation and subsequent propagation. Both the static and cyclic loading tests were carried out on Cracked Chevron Notched Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) rock specimens for fracture toughness investigations. In order to yield consistent fracture toughness values, two test methods were performed: CCNBD and short rod (SR) tests. After a series of experiments, the fracture toughness value obtained by the SR method was found to be higher than the value obtained by the CCNBD method. It was realised that the critical stress intensity factor (SIF) used in the formula for calculating the fracture toughness of the CCNBD specimens is a crucial factor in the method proposed by the ISRM (ISRM, 1995). In the cyclic loading tests, the reduction in fracture toughness under increasing cyclic loading was found to be up to 48 % of the static fracture toughness. The experimental results showed continuous irreversible damage accumulation {{at the tip of the}} chevron notched crack in the dynamic cyclic loading tests, strongly influenced by the loading amplitude. Contrary to the static tests, the cyclic tests produced much more crushed material in front of the tip of the chevron notched crack. On the other hand, the reduction in the indirect tensile strength (ITS) was found to be 30 % of the static ITS with sinusoidal cyclic loading tests, whereas increasing cyclic loading with the same valley values cause a reduction of the ITS by up to 35 % of the static ITS. In order to examine the major characteristics of the fatigue damage process at the microscopic level, scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was used. SEM investigations show that particle boundaries play an important role in rock fatigue. When compared with static rupture, the main differences are two-fold: (a) the number of fragments produced is much greater under cyclic loading than under static loading, and (b) intergranular cracks are formed due to <b>grain</b> <b>loosening</b> under cyclic loading. The main characteristic is particle breakage under cyclic loading, which probably starts at contacts between particles and is accompanied by the production of very small fragments, probably due to frictional sliding within the weak matrix. It is believed that point contacts at particle boundaries are regions of stress concentration (i. e. indenters). Transgranular cracks may emanate from these regions, and intergranular cracks sometimes pass through the contact points. This stage can be correlated with a steady progression of damage and produces a general “loosening” of the rock, which is a precursor to the formation of intergranular cracks...|$|R
