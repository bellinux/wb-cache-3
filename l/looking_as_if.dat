25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the targets related to {{fostering}} a popular science culture have been partly reached. For instance, in 2010, over 19 million students {{took part in}} the Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad for Public Schools, up from 14 million in 2006. However, since then, the number of participants has tended to stagnate. Up until 2011, it was <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the targets for distance learning and vocational education might be reached but, as of 2015, there had been little progress.|$|E

500|$|Ethan Sack from New York Daily News {{said that}} [...] "it's a tossup over who looks better in tights and high-heels, the 53-year-old Material Girl or the bevy of shirtless male dancers who gyrate around her." [...] Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video {{saying that it}} [...] "shows Madonna looking the best she has since at least 2005's video for 'Hung Up'. Of course there is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video. Caryn Ganz from Spin noticed that along with her old videos, Madonna also referenced her contemporary releases, like the videos for [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008) and [...] "Celebration", with the scenes showing her [...] "incredible" [...] dancing alone.|$|E

2500|$|The Lewis gun, used on many early Allied aircraft, proved next to {{impossible}} to successfully synchronise due to its open bolt firing cycle. In an open bolt firing cycle, {{it is impossible to}} predict the exact time any given round will fire, a problematic characteristic in a weapon one is attempting to fire between the spinning blades of a propeller. Photographs of fuselage-mounted Lewis guns aimed directly ahead on RNAS aircraft, and <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they [...] "should" [...] be synchronised — as with some of their Bristol Scouts — were probably in fact free firing, hardly a satisfactory solution.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943 Šakić married Nada, Maks Luburić's {{half-sister}} {{who began}} working at Jasenovac at age 16. Šakić became {{the commander of}} the Jasenovac concentration camp at the age of twenty-two in April 1944, his rapid rise through the ranks of the Ustaše coming {{partly as a result of}} his fanatic support for Pavelić's regime and partly due to his marriage to Nada. Jasenovac survivor Šimo Klaić recalled: [...] "Šakić was very young for such an important position. He was arrogant and always impeccably dressed in polished black leather boots and a tailored black Ustaše uniform. We were emaciated, in rags and sick. He would stride past us <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had stepped out of a fashion magazine".|$|E
2500|$|While not {{actually}} weapons, Missy also possessed {{a pair of}} vortex manipulators -- [...] "cheap and nasty time travel"—which are linked to one another, which she used to transport herself and Clara Oswald to the Doctor's 'farewell party' in medieval Essex ("The Magician's Apprentice"). They are destroyed when, in [...] "The Witch's Familiar", to avoid being killed by Daleks, they channel energy from the Daleks' weapons to teleport them away, <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were exterminated. In the same episode, Missy says her brooch contains a Gallifreyan Dark Star alloy pin, given to her by The Doctor [...] "when my daughter...", which she uses to pierce a Dalek's armoured shell. In [...] "The Doctor Falls", Missy uses a small blade concealed in her sleeve to stab her own past self, triggering his off-screen regeneration.|$|E

2500|$|The Cardinals retired {{his number}} 40, and Arizona State {{did the same}} for the number 42 he wore with the Sun Devils. The Cardinals have named the plaza {{surrounding}} their University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza. Later, on November 12, 2006, during a Cardinals game versus the Cowboys, a bronze statue was revealed in his honor. ASU also named the football locker room entryway to Sun Devil Stadium the [...] "Pat Tillman Memorial Tunnel" [...] and made a [...] "PT-42" [...] patch that they place on the neck of their uniforms as a permanent feature. In 2011, Pat Tillman Veteran's Center in the lower level of the Memorial Union opened on the Tempe campus. Before the 2013 season, the Tillman Tunnel was renovated with graphics, signage, double doors separate the locker room from the tunnel, and television replaying Tillman's career highlights, sound system and a gate opens up to the field featuring an image of him <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he's leading the team out.|$|E
2500|$|Zia's {{international}} standing greatly rose {{after his}} declaration {{to fight the}} Soviet invaders. Pakistan–United States relations took a much more positive turn. US President Jimmy Carter and his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, cut off US aid to Pakistan {{on the grounds that}} Pakistan had not made sufficient progress on the nuclear issue. Then, on 25 December 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and Carter offered Pakistan $325million in aid over three years. Zia rejected this as [...] "peanuts." [...] Carter also signed the finding in 1980 that allowed less than $50million a year to go to the Mujahideen. After Ronald Reagan came to office, defeating Carter for the US Presidency in 1980, all this changed, due to President Reagan's new priorities and the unlikely and remarkably effective effort by Congressman Charles Wilson aided by Joanne Herring, and CIA Afghan Desk Chief Gust Avrakotos to increase the funding for Operation Cyclone. Aid to the Afghan resistance, and to Pakistan, increased substantially, finally reaching $1billion. The United States, faced with a rival superpower <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were to create another Communist bloc, now engaged Zia to fight a US-aided war by proxy in Afghanistan against the Soviets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of the film for the New York Post, critic Lou Lumenick rated Knight and Day with one and a half out of four stars. Lumenick wrote, [...] "this is a big, dumb summer movie with no {{apparent}} ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio’s schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks." [...] American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film's writing, calling it a [...] "mindless flick"; he noted, [...] "The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling." [...] Levy gave the film a grade of [...] "C", and commented, [...] "Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, 'Knight and Day' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn't have mattered had the movie been witty or fun to watch." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film's director and writer, [...] "Clearly O'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as 'something for everybody,' but there's no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced." [...] In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie [...] "disposable", and singled out the film's script as its [...] "biggest problem", commenting that it [...] "feels lazy right from its lame-pun title". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was [...] "no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz", and commented regarding Cruise's acting, [...] "Tom Cruise spends much of 'Knight and Day' <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he's waiting for someone to pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure." ...|$|E
