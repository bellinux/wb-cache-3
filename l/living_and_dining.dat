5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E
25|$|The house's {{interior}} {{was carried out}} by architects James S. Kuhne and Percival H. Goodman from Chicago and New York respectively. The interior, painted in shades of yellow, coral, and blue, was designed in the Modernist style—as was the rest of the house. The central part of the interior features a <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> room connected via an aluminum staircase to an overhanging balcony with access to the terrace. The house's two bedrooms and the only bathroom, were located on the ground floor.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} eight large rooms, {{each with a}} fireplace framed by a wooden geometric trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The four large rooms {{on the first floor}} open from either side of the center hallway. They contain simple wide wood trim, including skirting boards and door frame moldings with [...] "subtly demarcated corners". The house's <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms have wide, wooden dado rails. Most of the wooden decorative trim is painted white, and the walls are plaster. The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den, which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls (exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s). All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors. The second floor has four bedrooms, with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood skirting boards and door frames.|$|E

500|$|The Art Deco-style interior, {{meant to}} evoke a 1920s Hollywood style, {{featured}} mahogany woodwork, tile floors and chandeliers. The inside also contained Spanish-style white stucco, spiral staircases and wrought iron features including stair rails, built-in cabinetry door and window hardware and lighting fixtures. The house included a basement pool (which eventually closed due to water leaks), a stone fireplace [...] in width, and small square windows. Also {{in the basement}} were the furnace, a storage room, and spaces for laundry and billiards. The main floor housed the garage, a kitchen and breakfast bay, the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms and a music room. The master bedroom was adjacent to a deck above the dining and music rooms at {{the southwest corner of}} the property. Fireplaces and hallway floors featured brown ceramic tile; black glazed ceramic tile was used in the master bathroom, while black, red and yellow tiles were used in the breakfast bay. One of the castle's bathrooms was said to be modeled on Charlie Chaplin's. The interior was arranged around a central stair tower capped with a conical roof clad in copper. Chimneys vented the centrally located furnace and rose from fireplaces in the house's west hall.|$|E
2500|$|The Icarians {{lived in}} {{communal}} dwellings of dormitories that shared central <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> areas. All families lived in two equal rooms {{in an apartment}} building and had {{the same kind of}} furniture. [...] Children were raised in a communal creche, not just by their own parents. [...] Tasks were divided among the group; one might be a seamstress and never need to cook.|$|E
2500|$|Construction on the Barton House began {{first in}} 1903 {{and not only}} was it the first {{building}} of the complex to be completed but also the first of Wright's in Buffalo. The principal living spaces are concentrated in the center two story portion of the house where the reception, <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> areas open into each other. The two main bedrooms are on the second story, at either end of a narrow hall. On the ground floor the kitchen is at the north end, while a scaled veranda extends from the reception hall to the south.|$|E

2500|$|The Buff, Straub, and Hensman firm's masterwork was Case Study House #20, the Saul Bass House (Altadena, 1958). It {{was built}} of factory-produced {{stressed}} skin panels and plywood vaults. [...] Despite thorough engineering calculations, the architects were not awarded a building permit until a sample plywood vault had been temporarily erected and loaded with weights. Its open plan introduced {{the concept of}} zoning: the owner's zone with studio office, garden, master bedroom & bath; a formal zone with <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms and entry atrium; a family zone with kitchen, family room, dining terrace, two additional bedrooms and swimming pool.|$|E
2500|$|Other Wright houses {{considered}} to be masterpieces of the late Prairie Period (1907–1910) are the Frederick Robie House in Chicago and the Avery and Queene Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois. The Robie House, with its soaring, cantilevered roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34 m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in {{the publication of the}} Wasmuth Portfolio (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the [...] "cornerstone of modernism".|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally the Parisian {{apartment}} had {{a kitchen}} {{at the back}} overlooking a service yard, with food carried through a corridor to {{the room where the}} family ate. Experiment in the inter-war period led to new post-war designs in which the kitchen was moved near to the apartment's entrance, close to the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> room. The back stairs disappeared. Water, electricity, gas and sewage were now integrated into the design of buildings. The kitchen was relatively small, with a layout designed to let the housewife perform different tasks without moving. The SAM {{played an important role in}} introducing these innovations. In Marcel Gascoin's 8-piece [...] "Logis 1949" [...] display the kitchen played a central role and followed the ergonomic principles spelled out by Paulette Bernège in the inter-war period.|$|E

2500|$|ABS-CBN held auditions {{stretching}} from May to June 2006 in various {{cities in the}} Philippines, as well as overseas auditions in Sydney, Milan, Tokyo, Dubai, and San Francisco, for the show's second season, which began on February 25, 2007 (it was originally scheduled for March), and ended on June 30 of the same year. These same auditions were also held for another reality show, Pinoy Dream Academy, another Endemol franchise. This season of Pinoy Big Brother promised a bigger house, more housemates (fourteen to be exact), and a stricter Big Brother. The [...] "bigger house" [...] concept {{stems from the fact}} that the house area was expanded and used in Pinoy Dream Academy. The house had been expanded with larger <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> areas, larger bedrooms, separate restrooms, and others. The number of cameras had been increased from 27 to 42 and the front doors of the house were now at the garden, leading to the eviction hall built next door which was the auditorium previously used in the first season of Pinoy Dream Academy. Previously the original front doors of the house area lead to the facade of the house. Pinoy Ako had also been rehashed, this time sung by the band CeBaLo (Yvan Lambatan, Panky Trinidad, Eman Abatayo, and Davey Langit of Pinoy Dream Academy).|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} Prairie houses, Wright {{designed}} the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces {{can be found}} in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms, spherical globes within wooden squares are integrated into the ceiling trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms, as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> rooms, are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.|$|E
