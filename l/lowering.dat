5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting.

Additionally, the Court upheld the provision <b>lowering</b> the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by <b>lowering</b> the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18.
