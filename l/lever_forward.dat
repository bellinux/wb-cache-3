When {{the key is}} struck, the motion on the wippen throws the spoon forward, pushing {{the lower end of}} damper <b>lever</b> <b>forward,</b> and {{releasing}} the damper from its contact with the string. The damper is held against the string by the wire spring which is seen running from the damper flange {{to the top of the}} damper lever.|$|E
50|$|It {{used to be}} {{operated}} mainly with a combined power controller, brake lever and dead man's handle at the driver's right hand. When the train is stopped {{the top of the}} handle is turned away from the position in which the driver holds it. To depart the driver turned the top of the handle and pushed the red <b>lever</b> <b>forward.</b> However, London Underground introduced TBTC on the Northern line in sections since June 2013. The entire line became TBTC driven in June 2014.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} popular gaffes noticed amongst Thunderbirds fans is the pilot's ability to control almost all of the many {{functions}} of the rocket by simply moving one of the two control <b>levers</b> <b>forward</b> or back. This is explained by other Thunderbirds fans as a precursor to the current system of electronic joystick controls that are backed up by sophisticated avionics computers.|$|R
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust <b>levers</b> <b>forward</b> to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|R
50|$|The crew's {{attention}} {{might have}} been distracted by the controller's direction. The controller was sending the crew a 20-second long message, which was too long. While the plane was descending, one of the crew members suddenly moved the thrust lever way back, into its idle position, and then moved the thrust <b>lever</b> <b>forward,</b> causing the autothrottle to disengage. The crew then desperately tried to lift the plane up, but the plane impacted water at a speed of 285 knots km/h, killing all on board instantly.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Galand revolver was a double-action, {{open frame}} (no strap {{across the top}} of the cylinder) revolver patented in 1868. Military versions were produced in 9 mm while civilian versions were made in 12 mm. The gun is easily recognizable due to its long extraction lever, which stretches under the gun to form the trigger guard. Pulling the <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> separates the barrel and cylinder from the rest of the gun. At the same time the extractor plate is blocked which catches any cartridges in the cylinder, thereby extracting them.|$|E
5000|$|Unusual design {{features}} included {{the safety and}} the magazine. The safety was a lever inset {{into the back of}} the grip and, with the gun cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the [...] "safe" [...] position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing pin spring. To disengage the safety, a shooter simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> and locking it flush with the back of the frame.|$|E

No effect on time consumption per burden was observed, but muscle constriction in the trapezius muscle measured using EMG was lower when the mini-lever option was used. Control errors were measured by counting the contacts between the remaining trees and the ma-chine elements. These were interpreted to result in damage to the trees. The frequency {{of this kind of}} damages was significantly smaller when using the mini-lever option.

5000|$|The repeating {{crossbow}} (...) , {{also known}} as the Zhuge crossbow ( [...] , previously romanized Chu-ko-nu) due to the design upgrade contributed by Three Kingdoms-era strategist Zhuge Liang (181â€”234 AD), is an ancient Chinese crossbow where the separate actions of stringing the bow, placing the bolt and shooting it can be accomplished with a simple one-handed movement while keeping the crossbow stationary. This allows a higher rate of fire than a normal crossbow: there is a top-mounted magazine containing a reservoir of bolts that are fed by gravity, and the mechanism is worked by simply moving a rectangular <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> and backward.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual or 5-speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT) was also available starting in 2002. SMT is standard feature in Australian market; however, air conditioning was optional. After 2003, a 6-speed SMT was an option. The SMT had no conventional H-pattern shift lever or clutch pedal. The driver could shift gears by tapping the shift <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> or backward or by pressing steering-wheel mounted buttons. Clutch engagement is automatic, and the car will automatically shift to second and then first gear when stopping. Cruise control was never offered with the manual transmission, but was standard for SMT cars.|$|E
5000|$|For most zero-turn mowers today, {{steering}} {{is simply}} changing the speeds {{of the drive}} tires. The tire speed is controlled by two levers that protrude {{on either side of}} the driver and typically extend over the lap. It is not that different from steering a shopping cart. [...] When both levers are pushed forward simultaneously with the same force, the mower moves forward; when both levers are pulled back simultaneously with the same force, the mower moves backward. Push one lever more than the other and the mower makes a gentle turn. Push one <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> and pull the other back and the mower pivots from the drive wheels, creating a zero-radius turn.|$|E
50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the <b>levers</b> <b>forward</b> automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R

50|$|The system {{consists}} of a small lever mounted under the right armrest and a flat switch underneath. The lever is slightly tilted, so that it matches the natural curve of the driver's hand when it's on the armrest. The lever has two buttons on either side. When at a standstill, the driver must push the right button, then (while holding it), push the <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> and release it select fourth fast. The current gear is shown as a large number on the main display. After doing this, the driver steps on the clutch pedal and waits for approximately two seconds. After the gearshift has completed, a double click is sounded through the speakers, and the driver proceeds with pulling off as normal.|$|E
50|$|The repeating {{crossbow}} automated {{the separate}} actions of stringing the bow, placing the projectile and shooting. This way the task {{can be accomplished}} with a simple one-handed movement, while keeping the weapon stationary. As a result, {{it is possible to}} shoot at a faster rate compared to an unmodified version. The Greek Polybolos was an ancient repeating ballista reputedly invented by Dionysius of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. The Chinese repeating crossbow, Chu Ko Nu, is a handheld crossbow that accomplishes the task with a magazine containing a number of bolts on top. The mechanism is worked by moving a rectangular <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> and backward. The weapon was mainly used as a weapon against lightly armored soldiers, since it shot small bolts that were often dipped in poison.|$|E
5000|$|Criticisms of the Lancer are {{not limited}} to its {{single-engine}} performance or lack thereof. The engine nacelle placement hampers visibility, particularly for the rear-seat pilot, and for both pilots during banked turns. Schiff compares the engine nacelles to [...] "...horse blinders that result in disorienting tunnel vision". The close proximity of the engines and propellers to the front-seat pilot's head create elevated noise levels described as [...] "remarkable" [...] or even [...] "paralyzing". The sidewall-mounted elevator trim lever looks very similar to the throttle lever of the single-engine Aeronca Champion, but pushing the <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> results in nose-down trim rather than increased engine power as in most Champion types; this creates a risk that an experienced Champion pilot may confuse the two controls when piloting the Lancer, with potentially catastrophic consequences if he/she instinctively pushes the lever fully forward to arrest an unwanted rate of descent. The 1 in wide vertical center bar in the windshield impairs the pilot's view of the runway on landing.|$|E
60|$|The {{incidents}} of our flight in Lord Roberts B do not arrange themselves in any consecutive order. To {{think of that}} adventure is like dipping haphazard into an album of views. One is reminded first of this and then of that. We were both lying down on a horizontal plate of basketwork; for Lord Roberts B had none of the elegant accommodation of a balloon. I lay forward, and my uncle behind me in such a position {{that he could see}} hardly anything of our flight. We were protected from rolling over simply by netting between the steel stays. It was impossible for us to stand up at all; we had either to lie or crawl on all fours over the basket work. Amidships were lockers made of Watson's Aulite material,--and between these it was that I had put my uncle, wrapped in rugs. I wore sealskin motoring boots and gloves, and a motoring fur coat over my tweeds, and I controlled the engine by Bowden wires and <b>levers</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{weapon was}} {{designed}} by a Swedish engineer, Helge Palmcrantz. He created a mechanism to load and fire a multiple barreled gun by simply moving a single <b>lever</b> backwards and <b>forwards.</b> It was patented in 1873.|$|R
5000|$|To {{launch the}} rocket the firer removes the large {{protective}} end caps and extends {{the rear of}} the launch tube, opens the sight, and moves the arming lever to [...] "armed". The weapon is then in spotting rifle mode. To fire the rocket, the firer moves a charge <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> with his firing hand thumb. The rocket motor burns out before it leaves the launch tube, the resulting blast being directed rearwards from the launch tube. The rocket then coasts to the target, arming itself after it has passed a certain arming distance. The warhead is a HEAT shaped charge and could penetrate 700mm of Rolled Homogeneous Armour at 90 degrees, as was taught to soldiers trained on the weapon system in the British Army, Royal Navy (Royal Marines) and RAF Regiment. It was also taught that sloped, composite and ERA, would reduce the penetration and would be an important factor when selecting the aiming point.|$|E
5000|$|About 1,000 of the [...] "Rocketeer" [...] model pistols were produced; a few saw {{service in}} the Vietnam War, and were {{featured}} in the James Bond book, and movie, You Only Live Twice, the Matt Helm film Murderers' Row {{as well as one}} of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. novels The Monster Wheel Affair. At about the same general size as the Colt M1911, the Gyrojet was considerably lighter at only 22 ounces (625 g) as the structure was mostly made of Zamac, a zinc alloy. The weapon was cocked by sliding forward a lever above the trigger to pull a round into the gun; the lever sprang back when the trigger was pulled. The lever hit the bullet on the nose, driving it into the firing pin. As the round left the chamber, it pulled the <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> again to recock it. The pistol lacked a removable magazine; rounds had to be pushed down from the open [...] "bolt" [...] and then held in place by quickly sliding a cover over them {{on the top of the}} gun. Reloading quickly was impossible.|$|E
50|$|The bolt {{closes the}} breech {{end of the}} barrel and {{contains}} the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever slot. A spring {{at the bottom of}} the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the bolt <b>lever</b> <b>forward</b> chambers this round and pushing the lever into the notch locks the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle, the British Lee-Enfield, and the Norwegian Krag-JÃ¸rgensen are examples of alternate bolt-action designs.|$|E
50|$|Manual {{dispensers}} of foam soap often {{consist of}} a large button which squeezes the foam out of a tube. Many liquid soap dispensers operate in this way as well. A few dispensers operate with a <b>lever</b> that pulls <b>forward</b> and squeezes the soap out.|$|R
50|$|The Amphicar's {{engine was}} mounted {{at the rear}} of the craft, driving the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual transmission. For use in the water, the same engine drove a pair of {{reversible}} propellers at the rear, with a second gear <b>lever</b> engaging <b>forward</b> or reverse drive. Once in the water, the main gear lever would normally be left in neutral. By engaging first gear as well as drive to the propellers when approaching a boat ramp, the Amphicar could drive itself out of the water.|$|R
50|$|A Takeoff/Go-around switch (TO/GA) is {{a switch}} on the {{autothrottle}} of modern large aircraft, with two modes: takeoff (TO) and go-around (GA). The mode {{is dependent on the}} phase of flight; usually, on approach to land, the autopilot will be set to approach mode, therefore if the TO/GA switch is pressed it will activate the go-around mode of the autothrottle; conversely, when take-off is set on the autopilot, the switch activates take off mode of the autothrottle. On Boeing aircraft TO/GA modes are selected by a separate switch near the throttle levers, but on Airbus aircraft it is activated by pushing the thrust <b>levers</b> fully <b>forward</b> to the TO/GA detent.|$|R

"The {{finger and}} thumb control lever {{works in a}} small {{quadrant}} which is marked at the top [...] "Traffic" [...] then [...] "High" [...] and at the bottom [...] "Low" [...] and finally [...] "Cold" [...] with spaces in between. Variations of this lever govern engine speeds. The forward, neutral and reverse positions for the central hand lever are stepped. To start the car from rest a driver presses out his clutch, moves his hand <b>lever</b> <b>forward,</b> and lets in the clutch in the ordinary way with slight acceleration. Thereafter {{the whole of the}} drive is done with the accelerator pedal, the accelerator allowing the engine to run up and keep constant maximum speed governed by the control lever {{on the top of the}} steering wheel by which engine braking power can also be regulated. When the accelerator is pressed after being released the effect is rather similar to that with a free wheel in use, in that the engine picks up to the speed that is suitable to the drive.

50|$|To {{drive the}} monorail, train captains need to {{slide into the}} driverâ€™s seat {{and wait for the}} signal. The Vehicle Management System informs the driver of the speed, the amount of {{electricity}} being sent to each car, what the brakes are doing, the air pressure in every tyre, and the status of the doors, all in real time. Once all safety checks are completed, the driver can accelerate the train by moving a <b>lever</b> <b>forward.</b> The lever works like a throttle on an aircraft, and has two functions, forward for drive and back for brake. Trains can accelerate to 60 km/h in 23.35 seconds and 80 km/h in 41.51 seconds. Trains have disc brakes for optimum stopping power. When the lever is pulled back initially, regenerative braking is applied as the train's electric motor spins the other way and collects power rather than pushing it out. Pulling back harder on the lever, engages the disc brakes which can be used to reduce speed and bring the train to a halt. Another set of emergency disc brakes engages, in case the regular brake fails. At tight corners, the monorail banks at a six-degree angle and passes the corner without slowing down. Like all trains, the monorail also has a Dead Manâ€™s Switch, where the trainâ€™s emergency brakes are applied if pressure is not maintained on the controller.|$|E
