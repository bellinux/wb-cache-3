25|$|The fall of Barcelona on 11 September 1714 to the Bourbon king Philip V militarily {{ended the}} Habsburg {{claim to the}} Spanish Crown, which became <b>legal</b> <b>fact</b> in the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip {{felt that he had}} been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had {{initially}} sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the Nueva Planta decrees that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain. During the second half of 18th century Catalonia started a successful process of proto-industrialization.|$|E

Article 3 stipulates that the disposition of property and claims of Japan and its nationals in Taiwan and Penghu shall be the subject of special arrangements between the governments of the ROC and Japan. And Article 10 stipulates that “nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).” From legal point of view, this provision confirmed that all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) are not nationals of ROC, but merely [...] "deemed as" [...] and to be treated as nationals of ROC for the purpose of the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Moreover, Note No. 1 in the Exchange of Notes accompanying the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stipulates that “the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government.” Consequently, at that time Japan agreed that Taiwan is a territory under the control of the ROC. However, although Japan recognized ROC's administration over Taiwan, she refrained from recognizing Taiwan as sovereign territory of ROC due to the <b>legal</b> <b>fact</b> that Japan had renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan in San Francisco Peach Treaty and could not make further disposition of Taiwan sovereignty.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I deploy an {{argument}} that I have developed {{in a number of}} recent papers to show that the most influential version of legal positivism - that associated with H. L. A. Hart - fails. The argument's engine is a requirement that a constitutive account of <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> must meet. According to this rational-relation requirement, it is not enough for a constitutive account of <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> to specify non-legal facts that modally determine the <b>legal</b> <b>facts.</b> The constitutive determinants of <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> must provide reasons for the obtaining of the <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> (in a sense of "reason" that I develop). I show that the Hartian account is unable to meet this requirement. That officials accept a rule of recognition does not by itself constitute a reason why the standards specified in that rule are part of the law of the community. I argue that it is false that understanding the explanatory significance of officials' acceptance of a rule is part of our reflective {{understanding of the nature of}} law. A second project of the paper is to respond to a family of objections that challenge me to explain why normative facts and descriptive facts together are better placed to provide reasons for <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> than descriptive facts alone. A unifying theme of the objections is that explanations have to stop somewhere; descriptive facts, it is suggested, are no worse a stopping place than normative facts. The paper also spells out a consequence of the rational-relation requirement: if an account of what, at the most basic level, determines <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> is true in any possible legal system, it is true in all possible legal systems. For example, if a Hartian account of <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> is true in any possible legal system, it is true in all possible legal systems. I use this all-or-nothing result in my critique of a Hartian account, but the result is of interest in its own right...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper, I discuss the {{different}} kinds of objectivity; general and legal objectivity more specifically. In the second part, I endeavour to explain the two main views that have been advanced to answer four core questions on legal objectivity. The first is whether moral and legal values are objective. Second, what is the nature of the relationship between legal and moral values? The third is whether, due to the specific nature of law, we should consider a domainspecific conception of objectivity for legal values. The fourth concerns whether there is a correspondence between legal values and <b>legal</b> <b>facts.</b> What is the explanation of the platitudes about the nature of law such as that law is reasongiving, normative or authoritative in character? In other words, do <b>legal</b> <b>facts</b> have a place in our ‘disenchanted’ or naturalistic (in the scientific sense) understanding of the world.

40|$|Legal {{argument}} {{is a debate}} or argument in explaining the issues between two or more people performed in court. Legal {{argument is}} one way to perform law finding with the purpose to avoid legal vacuum when the judge makes a legal reasoning in a verdict. In making a legal argument, it is at least performed by <b>legal</b> reasoning, logic, <b>facts.</b> However, some judges, in making a decision, did not use the legal arguments by <b>legal</b> reasoning and <b>facts</b> so that it resulted in debates and arguments.

50|$|The {{apparent}} dissent {{between the}} D66 cabinet ministers opinion (that Verdonk {{did not have}} to go) and the D66 parliamentary group opinion (that Verdonk had to go) resulted in some tense hours where it appeared that the two D66 cabinet ministers Laurens Jan Brinkhorst and Alexander Pechtold had broken away from their party, supporting the cabinet but not their party member Lousewies van der Laan. However, in a reconvened parliamentary session later that evening, Brinkhorst announced that he and Pechtold had resigned and supported their parliamentary group in this issue. The apparent difference was merely based on legality: Since the CDA and VVD ministers did not want to dismiss Verdonk, the D66 ministers could do nothing but state the obvious <b>legal</b> <b>fact</b> that an unsupported motion has no legal consequence. The political decision to leave the coalition was subsequently made by the parliamentary group.|$|E
5000|$|Another <b>legal</b> <b>fact</b> {{supporting}} this {{theory is that}} Adolf's father died either in 1198 or 1199 and he became the new Count of Altena-Mark and Krickenbeck. If he was not old enough to rule by that time his mother or a close relative would have become regent for him. But {{there is no sign}} of this in any charters of the time. Instead Adolf is signing further charters; in 1202 he names himself in another charter Adolfus puer comes de Marke. The puer comes was often translated as [...] "young Count" [...] but in medieval times the Latin word puer is also used for the social status known as knave or squire, or by simpler means as Knight in apprenticeship. In 1205 he signs again a charter but this time only using his legal name and title as Adolphus com. de Marka without the puer prefixed to the title. His time as squire was seemingly over. So any assumed date of birth after 1182 becomes more unlikely. Noble boys started their career at age 12, but more normally at 14 years, the same age they gained their majority. The apprenticeship lasted usually until the age of 20 or 21, before the squire was finally knighted. This fits perfectly with Adolf being puer comes... in 1202 and com. de Marka in 1205, even by means of the age, if he was born in 1182 he would have been 20 by 1202 and about 23 by 1205.|$|E

40|$|This book {{explores the}} nature of the Crown in its legal and {{political}} context. Here the term The Crown is being used, not as a direct reference to the Queen but, as a reference to the central power of the State which exercises legal and political authority.

The nature of the Crown has been taken for granted, in part because it is so fundamental and in part because many academics have no idea what the term The Crown amounts to. This book aims to redress this state of affairs by drawing together in one book a collection of essays that explores what the Crown is, or might be, and the critical issues relating to it. The Crown refers to the authority of Government and the very entity of Government. All the people going about the Governments business, Ministers of the Crown and civil servants do so under the cloak of the Crown with its powers and immunities.
