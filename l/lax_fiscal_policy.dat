5000|$|In the {{monetary}} model, hyperinflation {{is a positive}} feedback cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiralling costs, often from <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot [...] "win" [...] and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the Washington consensus of the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Two {{separate}} narratives {{have emerged}} {{in the wake of}} the Global Financial Crisis. One speaks of private financial excess and the key role of the banking system in leveraging and deleveraging the economy.

This paper studies the co-evolution of public and private sector debt in advanced countries since 1870. We find that in advanced economies financial stability risks have come from private sector credit booms and not from the expansion of public debt. However, we find evidence that high levels of public debt have tended to exacerbate the effects of private sector deleveraging after crises, leading to more prolonged periods of economic depression.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{conventional}} wisdom has held that fixed rates provide more fiscal discipline than do flexible rates. In this paper we show that this wisdom need not hold in a standard model in which <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is endogenously determined by a maximizing fiscal authority. The claim that fixed rates induce more discipline stresses that sustained adoption of <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> must eventually lead to an exhaustion of reserves and thus to a politically costly collapse of the peg. Hence, under fixed rates bad behavior today leads to punishment tomorrow. Under flexible rates bad behavior has costs as well. The difference is in the intertemporal distribution of these costs: flexible rates allow the effects of unsound <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> to manifest themselves immediately through movements in the exchange rate. Hence, bad behavior today leads to punishment today. If fiscal authorities are impatient, flexible rates - by forcing the costs to be paid up-front - provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative private agent. The recent experience of Sub- Saharan countries supplies some preliminary evidence that matches the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

40|$|How do {{exchange}} rate regimes influence fiscal discipline? This important question has typically been addressed using models assuming perfect capital mobility, even though capital controls are pervasive in emerging and developing countries. This paper analyzes {{the effects of}} capital controls on fiscal performance by focusing on dual {{exchange rate}} regimes. In a model in which <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is endogenously determined by a non-benevolent fiscal authority, the paper shows that capital controls induce impatient politicians to have looser <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> than under fixed and flexible regimes operating under perfect capital mobility. While capital controls enable politicians to enjoy the same temporarily low inflation as fixed regimes (since the commercial exchange rate {{is assumed to be}} fixed) <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> also result in a temporary consumption boom which is regarded as desirable by impatient politicians.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, many {{countries}} have passed a legislation giving more independence to their central banks. This institutional evolution has concerned several developed countries but also developing countries and, {{is consistent with the}} Barro and Gordon’s theory of time-inconsistent monetary policy, which emphasizes the importance of independence in terms of acquiring anti-inflationary credibility. But, central bank independence (CBI) could also affect the design of fiscal policy. Indeed, theoretical literature shows that a greater degree of independence influences government to fiscal discipline; conversely, a weak degree of independence may influence the government to pursue <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> However, the few empirical studies that attempted to assess the relation between CBI and budget deficits principally focused on industrial countries and provided disappointing econometric results. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by providing empirical analysis of the influence of CBI on budget deficits in a large set of developing countries over the 1995 - 2004 period. Using a panel data analysis and two indicators of CBI, the results show a negative relationship between CBI and budget deficits. JEL Classification: E 58, H 6...|$|E

40|$|This Policy Brief {{offers an}} {{in-depth}} {{review of the}} Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and looks at whether the margins of flexibility within existing rules are sufficient in the current climate of low growth, or {{whether there is a}} need to broaden them. The issue is especially relevant as the changing economic environment is raising fresh questions about whether the EU’s current common economic policies are able to manage dismal growth and low inflation. The fragile state of confidence in financial markets and the unresolved but inevitable questions of moral hazard linked to <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> mean that no large-scale fiscal expansion to support the recovery of economic activity is feasible. The discussion may therefore only concern the scope within the SGP to accommodate an unexpected drop in economic activity and to provide room for the implementation of structural reforms. Here, we analyse the flexibility clauses of the Stability and Growth Pact under three headings; namely “exceptional circumstances”, “structural reforms and other relevant factors”, and the “investment clause”. Recommendation: Our main conclusion is that the SGP contains sufficient flexibility to accommodate an unexpected drop in economic activity and has the margins needed to finance structural reforms during the transition to the new regime. We therefore see no need to change the existing rules of the SGP. We believe that the ongoing debate about a fresh growth strategy for the eurozone and the European Union would greatly benefit from removing from the Council table ill-formulated and unnecessary demands for greater flexibility in the SGP...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issues of capital controls and informal economy. Both subjects have evoked considerable interest in both academic environments and policy circles, especially given their importance for developing countries. The dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 1 analyzes how exchange rate regimes influence fiscal discipline. This important question has typically been addressed using models assuming perfect capital mobility, even though capital controls are pervasive in developing countries. This chapter analyzes the effects of capital controls on fiscal performance by focusing on dual exchange rate regimes. In a model in which <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is endogenously determined by a non-benevolent fiscal authority, the paper shows that capital controls induce impatient politicians to have looser <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> than under fixed and flexible regimes operating under perfect capital mobility. While capital controls enable politicians to enjoy the same temporarily low inflation as fixed regimes (since the commercial exchange rate {{is assumed to be}} fixed) <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> also result in a temporary consumption boom which is regarded as desirable by impatient politicians. The consumption boom occurs because, as households attempt to get rid of unwanted real money balances, the real domestic interest rate falls.

Chapter 2 estimates the size of the informal economy for the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries and 26 mainly Latin American countries in the early 2000 s, being the first study to address this issue for the ECCU economies and many other Central American and Caribbean countries. Using a structural equation modeling approach we find that a stringent tax system and regulatory environment, higher inflation and dominance of the agriculture sector are key factors in determining the size of the informal economy. The results also confirm that a higher degree of informality reduces labor unionization, the number of contributors to social security schemes and enrollment rates in education...|$|R

The decision-makers have not taken into account the risk factors, triggering legislativeincoherence and instability due to the challenging and approval as non-constitutional of many such normativeacts by the Romanian Constitutional Court.

The <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> of the expenditures brings about an involuntary fiscal contraction inthe event of an economic downturn (Rosen and Gayer, 2010), as it was the case in Romania.

40|$|Monetary, tax, and {{innovation}} policy key to raising Canadian living standards, says C. D. Howe study Canadians are underemployed, overtaxed, and underproductive, says Pierre Fortin, one of Canada’s foremost economists, in the C. D. Howe Institute’s annual Benefactors Lecture, delivered in Montreal today. Fortin urges a three-pronged strategy {{to close the}} gap between Canadian and US living standards and ensure Canadian prosperity in the future. Fortin — who is Professor of Economics, Université du Québec à Montréal, and Webster Research Associate, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research — notes that the gap between Canadian and US living standards, which narrowed until the 1970 s, ceased closing in the 1980 s and began widening in the 1990 s. He documents trends in four factors that determined changes in private disposable income per person, a common measure of living standards: the effects of changing terms of trade; changes in the amount of income generated that stays in the hands of households and businesses after net payments to foreigners and governments; changes in output per employed person (labor productivity); and changes in the share of the population that is employed. Through the three decades, the United States experienced relatively little variance in its growth experience. Canada, by contrast, suffered from a decline in relative productivity growth in the 1980 s, a relatively poor employment record in the 1990 s, and declining prices for key exports. Looking for causes behind these developments, Fortin emphasizes poor macroeconomic management in Canada in the 1980 s and 1990 s, when overly <b>lax</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and overly tight monetary policy combined to produce an explosion of public debt and interest costs, followed by a rise in taxes. To undo the damage, he argues, reforms in both monetary and budgetary policy are needed. On the monetary side, Fortin urges the Bank of Canada to increase its target range for inflation from its current 1 – 3 percent to 2 – 4 percent. He also suggests more aggressive probing of the economy’s ability to run at a higher level of capacity use without triggering accelerating inflation — in fact, Fortin argues, structural changes in the economy may now make an unemploymen...|$|E

Such a comparison is justified by a crucial similarity of the economies of both countries; they are small, open economies highly integrated within the European Union.

Hungary has taken advantage of the adjustment mechanism of a flexible exchange rate but its economic policy lacked credibility and there were no strong incentives – even cyclical – for fast growth.

To account for the challenges posed by China's vast geography, we use data at the provincial level. We find that (i) <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> generally has 'Keynesian' effects, and (ii) <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is mostly conducted pro-cyclically. This means that <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is more an element of destabilization than a tool for stabilizationGriffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} recent <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> of nonrenewable resource {{exporting countries}} in Latin America and the Caribbean {{in the context}} of sharp swings in resource prices. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> were predominantly procyclical during the boom period 2003 - 08 but to significantly differing degrees within the sample. Countries that pursued more conservative <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> during the boom were then able to implement countercyclical <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> during the downturn; moreover, they reduced or maintained their fiscal vulnerability to resource shocks, while their long-term fiscal sustainability positions improved or were broadly unchanged. However, these dimensions of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{did not seem to be}} linked to fiscal rules or resource funds, as countries with such institutions displayed a broad range of fiscal responses to the recent cycle.
