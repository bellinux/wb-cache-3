Patients and Methods: In a prospective study 560 HIV-positive individuals evaluated for total and CD 4 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count.</b> For correlation between CD 4 <b>count</b> and total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count,</b> haemoglobin and haematocrit we defined cut-off values as 200 cell/μl, 1200 cell/μl, 12 gr/dl and 30 %, respectively, and compared CD 4 count with each parameter separately. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of varying total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> cutoffs were computed for CD 4 count ≤ 200 cell/μl and ≤ 350 cell/μl. Results: Strong degree of correlation was noted between CD 4 and total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> (r: 0. 610, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} the percentage of CD 4 + T-cells to indicate when antiretroviral therapy should be started in children with HIV in resource-poor settings. We aimed to assess thresholds of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> at which antiretroviral therapy should be considered, and compared monitoring of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> with monitoring of CD 4 -cell percentage. METHODS: Longitudinal data on 3917 children with HIV infection were pooled from observational and randomised studies in Europe and the USA. The 12 -month risks of death and AIDS by most recent total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> and age were estimated by parametric survival models, based on measurements before antiretroviral therapy or during zidovudine monotherapy. Risks were derived and compared at thresholds of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> and CD 4 -cell percentage for starting antiretroviral therapy recommended in WHO 2003 guidelines. FINDINGS: Total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> was a powerful predictor of the risk of disease progression despite a weak correlation with CD 4 -cell percentage (r= 0. 08 - 0. 19 dependent on age). For children older than 2 years, the 12 -month risk of death and AIDS increased sharply at values less than 1500 - 2000 cells per muL, with little trend at higher values. Younger children had higher risks and total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> was less prognostic. Mortality risk was substantially higher at thresholds of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> recommended by WHO than at corresponding thresholds of CD 4 -cell percentage. When the markers were compared at the threshold values at which mortality risks were about equal, total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> was as effective as CD 4 -cell percentage for identifying children before death, but resulted in an earlier start of antiretroviral therapy. INTERPRETATION: In this population, total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> was a strong predictor of short-term disease progression, being only marginally less predictive than CD 4 -cell percentage. Confirmatory studies in resource-poor settings are needed to identify the most cost-effective markers to guide initiation of antiretroviral therapy...|$|R
