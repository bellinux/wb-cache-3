5|$|The film Rififi was {{originally}} {{to be directed}} by Jean-Pierre Melville, a later luminary of the heist film genre. Melville gave his blessing to American director Jules Dassin when the latter asked for his permission to take the helm. It was Dassin's first film in five years; he had been blacklisted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities after fellow director Edward Dmytryk named him a communist in April 1951. Subsequently, Dassin attempted to rebuild his career in Europe. Several such film projects were stopped through long-distance efforts by the US government. Dassin attempted a film L'Ennemi public numero un, which was halted after stars Fernandel and Zsa Zsa Gabor withdrew under American pressure. An attempt to film an adaptation of Giovanni Verga's Mastro don Gesualdo in Rome was halted by the US Embassy. Dassin received an offer from an agent in Paris, France where he met producer Henri Bérard who had acquired the rights to Auguste Le Breton's popular crime novel Du Rififi chez <b>les</b> <b>hommes.</b> Bérard chose Dassin due to the major success in France of Dassin's previous film The Naked City.|$|E

During the same period Renoir produced Clifford Odets' play The Big Knife in Paris. He also wrote his own play, Orvet, and produced it in Paris featuring Leslie Caron.|$|E

5000|$|In Normandy, it {{may have}} {{sometimes}} mixed up with Old Norse hólmr, meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as [...] "holm".

25|$|Across Europe, {{the late}} 11th and 12th centuries saw an {{unprecedented}} {{growth in the}} number of churches. A great number of these buildings, both large and small, remain, some almost intact and in others altered almost beyond recognition in later centuries. They include many very well known churches such as Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, the Baptistery in Florence and San Zeno Maggiore in Verona. In France, the famous abbeys of Aux Dames and <b>Les</b> <b>Hommes</b> at Caen and Mont Saint-Michel date from this period, as well as the abbeys of the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. Many cathedrals owe their foundation to this date, with others beginning as abbey churches, and later becoming cathedrals. In England, of the cathedrals of ancient foundation, all were begun in this period with the exception of Salisbury, where the monks relocated from the Norman church at Old Sarum, and several, such as Canterbury, which were rebuilt on the site of Saxon churches. In Spain, the most famous church of the period is Santiago de Compostela. In Germany, the Rhine and its tributaries were the location of many Romanesque abbeys, notably Mainz, Worms, Speyer and Bamberg. In Cologne, then the largest city north of the Alps, a very important group of large city churches survives largely intact. As monasticism spread across Europe, Romanesque churches sprang up in Scotland, Scandinavia, Poland, Hungary, Sicily, Serbia and Tunisia. Several important Romanesque churches were built in the Crusader kingdoms.|$|E

2500|$|Henri Guilbeaux, {{reviewing}} the 1911 Indépendants for <b>Les</b> <b>Hommes</b> du jour described {{the paintings of}} Metzinger, Léger and others as 'grotesque, ridiculous, intended to bewilder—it would appear—the bourgeoisie', paintings 'whose cubes, cones and pyramids pile up, collapse and ... make you laugh.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Metzinger's (then) audacious {{prediction}} that artists would take abstraction to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely {{and returning to}} what Metzinger calls the [...] "primordial white unity", a [...] "completely white canvas" [...] would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto entitled Manifeste de l'école amorphiste, published in <b>Les</b> <b>Hommes</b> du Jour (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.

2500|$|In August, France passed what a New York Times {{editorial}} {{described as}} the most comprehensive law on gender equality in that country to date, Loi pour l'égalité réelle entre les femmes et <b>les</b> <b>hommes.</b> The law allows for abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women previously had to be [...] "in distress" [...] to obtain an abortion. Provisions were changed to encourage more men to take paternal leave and requiring workplaces to improve gender equality or face fines. There are also several provisions to strengthen the fight against domestic abuse. Beauty pageants were forbidden for girls under 13 years of age, and the media was forbidden from portraying women in a sexist or demeaning way. The law also mandated gender quotas for the boards of sports organizations and public companies.|$|E
2500|$|Although Raison was {{somewhat}} {{interested in politics}} (at least twice he produced pieces inspired by political events: an offertory from Premier livre d'orgue is dedicated to Louis XIV's entrance into the city hall on January 30, 1687, and several pieces in Second livre d'orgue commemorate the [...] "long desired peace" [...] that followed the Treaty of Utrecht), {{as far as the}} circumstances of his life are known, he seems to have been an exceptionally private and pious person. No record of Raison travelling or acting as organ consultant survives. His Premier livre d'orgue contains extensive instructions for inexperienced church musicians. He apparently never played at court and was not known by the associations there. His contacts with other organists were probably limited, and he was not mentioned in Évrard Titon du Tillet's famous Le Parnasse François, a 1732 book of biographies of famous French musicians. The Lettres sur <b>les</b> <b>hommes</b> célèbres du siècle de Louis XV, a similar book by the son of organist and composer Louis-Claude Daquin, also does not contain any mention of Raison, even though Raison's pupil Clérambault is given due praise.|$|E
