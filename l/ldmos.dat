40|$|The use {{of contact}} etching stop layer (CESL) {{stressors}} {{is a popular}} technique for introducing stress into a transistor channel.

40|$|In many {{automotive}} applications, repetitive selfheating is {{the most}} critical operation condition for <b>LDMOS</b> transistors in smart power ICs. This is attributed to thermomechanical stress in the on-chip metallization, which results from the different thermal expansion coefficients of the metal and the intermetal dielectric. After many cycles, the accumulated strain in the metallization can lead to short circuits, thus limiting the lifetime. Increasing the <b>LDMOS</b> size can help to lower peak temperatures and therefore to reduce the stress. The downside {{of this is a}} higher cost. Hence, it has been suggested to use resilient systems that monitor the <b>LDMOS</b> metallization and lower the stress once a certain level of degradation is reached. Then, lifetime requirements can be fulfilled without oversizing <b>LDMOS</b> transistors, even though a certain performance loss has to be accepted. For such systems, suitable sensors for metal degradation are required. This work proposes a floating metal line embedded in the <b>LDMOS</b> metallization.

The use as a high-frequency device has become more important lately since the <b>LDMOS</b> offers an low cost solution for telecommunication applications. An important property of the <b>LDMOS</b> concept {{is that it can}} be manufactured in virtually the same process used in standard CMOS production. It only requires one extra process step, which is easily implemented. The other important aspect that gives the <b>LDMOS</b> the good high-frequency performance is that the channel length is a process parameter and not a lithography parameter. This thesis investigates the <b>LDMOS</b> transistor primarily from two aspects. The first is the high-voltage performance. For a high-voltage device the most important parameter is the breakdown voltage. The second most important parameter is the on-resistance that has the property of being in contradiction of the breakdown voltage and usually trade-offs are made to achieve acceptable performance.
