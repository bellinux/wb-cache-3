40|$|Aluminium-silicon alloys {{have been}} wide {{accepted}} in the automotive, electric and aerospace industries. Preferred orientation is a very common condition for metals and alloys. Particularly, aluminium induces texture during the forming process. The preparation of an aggregate with completely random crystal orientation is a difficult task. The present work was undertaken to analyse the texture by X-ray diffraction techniques, of three spray formed hypereutectic Al-Si alloys. Samples were taken from a billet of an experimental alloy (alloy 1) and were subsequently hot-rolled and cold-rolled (height reduction), 72 % and 70 %, respectively. The other used samples, alloys 2 and 3, were taken from cylinders liners. The results from the <b>Laue</b> <b>camera</b> showed texture just in the axial direction of alloy 3. The pole figures also indicated {{the presence of a}} typical low intensity deformation texture, especially for alloy 3. The spray formed microstructure, which is very fine, hinders the Al-Si texture formation during mechanical work...|$|E
40|$|Large grain niobium {{is being}} {{examined}} for fabricating superconducting radiofrequency cavities {{as an alternative}} to using rolled sheet with fine grains. It is desirable to know the grain orientations of a niobium ingot slice before fabrication, as this allows heterogeneous strain and surface roughness effects arising from etching to be anticipated. Characterization of grain orientations has been done using orientation imaging microscopy (OIM), which requires destructive extraction of pieces from an ingot slice. Use of a <b>Laue</b> <b>camera</b> allows nondestructive characterization of grain orientations, a process useful for evaluating slices and deformation during the manufacturing process. Five ingot slices from CBMM, Ningxia, and Heraeus are compared. One set of slices was deformed into a half cell and the deformation processes that cause crystal rotations have been investigated and compared with analytical predictions. The five ingot slices are compared in terms of their grain orientations and grain boundary misorientations, indicating no obvious commonalities, which suggests that grain orientations develop randomly during solidification...|$|E
40|$|A {{design for}} an x-ray {{diffraction}} teaching device has been presented. From the design a diffraction device has been con-structed. Based {{on the principles}} of the original work by Max von <b>Laue,</b> a diffraction <b>camera</b> has been constructed using a diagnostic x-ray machine. The diffraction camera provides a fast, safe, easy to operate means of obtaining useable Laue diffraction patterns. The analysis of the diffraction pattern is carried out using the gnomonic projection. The diffraction spots are identifiable in the gnomonic projection. Though the patterns lack perfection, they pro-vide visible proof to the student that x-ray diffraction has taken place. The safety of the diffraction device is assured through proper shielding. The leakage rates do not exceed the limits set by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement. Design and Construction of an X-ra...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Fast Acquisition <b>Laue</b> <b>Camera</b> for Neutrons (FALCON) is {{a thermal}} neutron Laue {{diffractometer}} at HZB in Berlin. The instrument comprises two scintillator plate detectors coupled to four iCCD cameras each. One detector {{is placed in}} the backscattering position, enabling neutrons to pass through the centre of the detector box. The second detector is free to be placed either in the direct transmission position, or rotated to positions around the sample. The image-intensified CCDs, supplied by Photonic Science Ltd as components of the detector units, are capable of obtaining 20 -bit digitization Laue images in under ten seconds. Whilst our instrument will be used as a diffractometer primarily for crystal structure determination, the configuration of the detectors is similar to ICON at PSI in Switzerland, especially in their ‘double detector set-up’. In 2015 FALCON enters the commissioning phase whereby one of our activities will be to calibrate the detector units using CONRAD, the cold neutron imaging instrument of HZB. CONRAD will be used to characterise those factors which affect the total efficiency of the detectors i. e. cameras, lenses, CCD chips and the scintillators themselves e. g. homogeneity of the scintillator plate thickness...|$|E
40|$|Single-crystal x-ray {{diffraction}} {{data can be}} measured very quickly in Laue geometry compared with monochromatic methods. Alternatively, this gain factor can be used instead to reduce the sample volume for a fixed exposure time. In the latter case especially, there is a critical need to control parasitic scatter in the <b>Laue</b> <b>camera.</b> The use of Laue geometry {{as a means of}} quantitative data acquisition required the solution of some fundamental problems. The so-called "overlapping orders problem" has been found not to be limiting. It can be shown that the bulk of the Laue spots are single order, provided dhkl< 2 dmin where dhkl is the interplanar spacing and dmin is the resolution limit of the data. In addition, empirical wavelength normalization is required. This can be achieved by using the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The fact that different equivalents occur at different wavelengths means that the differences in these intensities can be used to establish the "Î» curve. " Successful wavelength normalization to date has used a relatively broad-band pass. The multiplicity distribution is the histogram of the number of spots of a given order. This distribution is determined by the ratio Î»max/ Î»min (Î»max =maximum wavelength, Î»min =minimum wavelength in the beam). Î»max is determined by the use of any filters in the beamline. Î»min is determined either by the spectral curve or a critical cutoff if a mirror is used. A mirror can be usefully introduced to enhance the multiplicity distribution in favor of single wavelength spots or to focus the white beam; so far only vertical focussing has been used. The detector options used to date have been photographic film, Fuji image plate (at Photon Factory) /Kodak storage phosphor (at Cornell) and charge coupled device (CCD) (at Daresbury). It is useful to consider the joint theoretical spatial and energy distribution of spots in defining the detector specification and geometry. To date, we have processed Laue film data successfully. The attraction of using the CCD, even to look at {{a small portion of the}} Laue pattern, is to view the diffraction in real time. This will allow tight control of parasitic scatter for microcrystal Laue diffraction and real-time monitoring for time-resolved work. We performed initial experiments using a direct detection CCD imager, and have obtained satisfactory diffraction data on a 40 ms time scale. Results of this work will be presented. In order to assess the efficacy of the Laue method for quantitative crystallography, we have used Laue data from the protein pea lectin and compared it in detail with monochromatic pea lectin data. To assess the use of a vertically focussing mirror, we have successfully used a mercury derivative protein crystal to yield isomorphous and anomalous differences suitable for phase determination. In both the pea lectin and mercury derivative cases, doublet Laue spots were deconvoluted. In the latter case, the data were used in a difference Fourier calculation which showed the mercury peak. Future developments and projections based on multipole sources are given...|$|E
