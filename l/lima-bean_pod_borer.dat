40|$|Lentil {{is one of}} the worldâ€™s most {{important}} food plants and is particularly so in North Africa and South Asia and parts of North America, Europe and Australia. Consequently the crop is exposed to a broad spectrum of insect species {{in a wide variety of}} locations. The management of insect pests of the crop is crucial to optimizing production. The major insect pests of lentil in the field are aphids (Aphis craccivora & Acyrthosiphonpisum), leaf weevils (Sitona spp.), Lygus bugs, (Lygusspp.), and the Cutworm, (Agrotis ipsilon). Several other insect species are considered as minor field pests which are also noteworthy and include Thrips (Thrips, Kakothrips, & Frankiniella), Bud weevils (Apionarrogans), the pea moth, (Cydia nigricana), pod borers, (Helicoverpa armigera & Heliothis spp.), <b>Lima-bean</b> <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> (Etiella zinckenella), root aphids (Smynthurodes betae) and leaf miners (Liriomyza spp. and Phytomyza spp.). The most serious and frequently encountered insect pests of the stored grain are Bruchus ervi and B. lentis with Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus also widespread. This chapter describes the morphology, lifecycle and crop damage caused by each of the insects pest species on lentil and provides detailed descriptions of management options for each species with references for each recommended action. For most insect species the use of pesticides is the primary management option. However, for some species, there are known sources of host plant resistance, as well as other integrated pest management options including biological control (e. g., beneficial insect predators and biological pesticides) and cultural practices, that can be used to help manage the pests and where known these are also described...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} half-diallel crosses {{involving}} early, medium and late maturity desi and kabuli type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes with stable resistance to Helicoverpa <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> {{along with the}} parents, were evaluated at two locations in India to understand the inheritance of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield. Inheritance of resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and grain yield was different in desi and kabuli types. In desi type chickpea, the additive component of genetic variance was important in early maturity and dominance component was predominant in medium maturity group, while in the late maturity group, additive as well as dominance components were equally important in the inheritance of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance. Both dominant and recessive genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance seemed equally frequent in the desi type parental lines of medium maturity group. However, dominant genes were in overall excess in the parents of early and late maturity groups. In the kabuli medium maturity group, parents appeared to be genetically similar, possibly due to dispersion of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility, while their F 1 s were significantly different for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage. The association of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility in the parents {{could be attributed to}} the similarity of parents as well as their F 1 s for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage in kabuli early and late maturity groups. Grain yield was predominantly under the control of dominant gene action irrespective of the maturity groups in desi chickpea. In all the maturity groups, dominant and recessive genes were in equal frequency among the desi parental lines. Dominant genes, which tend to increase or decrease grain yield are more or less present in equal frequency in parents of the early maturity group, while in medium and late maturity groups, they were comparatively in unequal frequency in desi type. Unlike in desi chickpea, differential patterns of genetic components were observed in kabuli chickpea. While the dominant genetic component was important in early and late maturity group, additive gene action was involved in the inheritance of grain yield in medium duration group in kabuli chickpea. The dominant and recessive genes controlling grain yield are asymmetrically distributed in early and medium maturity groups in kabuli chickpea. The implications of the inheritance pattern of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield are discussed in the context of strategies to enhance <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield in desi and kabuli chickpea cultivars...|$|R

Such birds can reduce damage by pests, such as <b>pod</b> <b>borers,</b> very effectively. These are the {{conclusions}} from recent trials in Bangalore, India. Researchers from the University of Agricultural Sciences have been studying birds that fed on <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> of field beans. Five species of birds were found to be important: the house crow, the house sparrow, the golden oriole, the black drongo and the mynah. At one time of year these birds were seen to eat as many as five to eight larvae per minute. Over the whole season the house crows, which were present at a population of about 200 per sq km, each accounted for four larvae per minute. <b>Pod</b> <b>borers</b> were not the only insects eaten. Analyses of the birds' crops showed that their diet consisted of about one-third <b>pod</b> <b>borers,</b> and about twice that for other insects, but whether some of these are beneficial has still to be verified. Some plant material was eaten by one species, the house sparrow, but it was far less than would have been damaged by the <b>pod</b> <b>borers.</b> At the site, with the highest bird population, crop losses resulting from <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> were 22 %, compared to 61 % where bird numbers only 50 per sq km. The researchers conclude that encouraging insectivorous birds is a far more effective method of controlling nests for subsistence farmers than using expensive chemicals. Birds can be encouraged by providing niches for feeding, shelter and nesting in tree and shrub borders around the herds. Bamboo poles can be used to provide extra perching sites.

40|$|Coriander and egrets {{are helping}} {{chickpea}} farmers in India to control pests {{that have developed}} resistance to pesticides. Chickpea leaves and pods naturally exude an acid that usually keeps pests away. Recently. though, the <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> (Helicoverpa armigera) has developed tolerance to this natural defensive system, and the borer has also become resistant to most pesticides. Unfortunately, the same defensive system makes chickpeas inhospitable plants for beneficial insects' posing problems for an effective biological control strategy. However, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have devised an effective integrated pest management (IPM) programme. First they suggested growing chickpeas in wider rows than usual so that egrets can walk down the rows and pick off the <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> caterpillars. The {{next step was to}} get the <b>pod</b> <b>borer's</b> natural enemies to move into the crop. The flowers of umbelliferous plants, like coriander, form platforms that grow up above the plants which are preferred sites for insects. who use them to bask in the sun and drink the nectar. By intercropping with coriander, parasitic insects are provided with a platform from which they can attack the <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> without coming into contact with the acid exudates. Another pan of the IPM strategy is to plant different types of chickpeas. ICRISAT researchers have some chickpea varieties that exude more potent acid but are lower yielding.

Trichomes of the wild parents (high density of the non-glandular trichomes C and D, and glandular trichome B and low density of glandular trichome A) were dominant over the trichome features of C. cajan. A single dominant gene as indicated by the segregation patterns individually will govern each trait in the F 2 and backcross generation.

40|$|Context: Lamda {{cyhalothrin}} and neem seed extract {{can protect}} chickpea by controlling <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Objective: To {{find out the}} effect of neem seed extract and lambda-cyhalothrin application schedule for the effective and economic management of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> attacking chickpea. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted in High Barind Tract of northern Bangladesh with the application of neem seed extract @ 50 g-l (two and three spraying) and lambda-cyhalothrin. (Karate 2. 5 EC) @ 2 ml-l (two and three spraying) and untreated control. The seeds of BARI-Chola 5 chickpea were sown in rows with the spacing of 40 cm. At maturity, all the pods were collected from 10 randomly selected plants from middle rows of each plot. The damaged (bored) and total numbers of pod were counted. The grain yield loss (kg-ha) and percent pod damage were determined. The seed yield of each treatment was converted to kg-ha. Results: The lowest pod damage (2. 55 %) as well as grain yield loss (34. 90 kg-ha) were observed in the treatment where lamda cyhalothrin applied three times at 7 days interval from flowering stage. Chickpea seed yield was maximum (1338 kg-ha) with lamda cyhalothrin sprayed thrice which was identical to sprayed twice (1280 kg-ha). Neem seed extract showed a marginal performance to control chickpea <b>pod</b> <b>borer.</b> The highest marginal benefit cost ratio (3. 19) was recorded from lamda cyhalothrin sprayed twice. Conclusion: Lamda cyhalothrin double sprayed with 7 days interval from pod formation stage is the best package in managing <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> in chickpea considering efficacy and profitability...|$|R

40|$|Nearly 60 insect {{species are}} known to feed on chickpea, of which cutworm, Agrotis spp., beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua leaf miner, Liriomyza cicerina), aphid, Aphis craccivora, <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Helicoverpa armigera, and bruchid, Callosobruchus chinensis are the major pests worldwide. Low to {{moderate}} levels of resistance {{have been identified in}} the cultivated germplasm. Wild relatives of chickpea have high levels of resistance to H. armigera. Efforts are also underway to utilize molecular techniques to increase the levels of resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer.</b> Transgenic chickpea plants with cryIIa gene have also been developed. Synthetic insecticides, agronomic practices, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), and natural plant products have been evaluated as components of pest management in chickpea...|$|R
40|$|Pigeon pea is {{cultivated}} in Madhya Pradesh to meet domestic requirement. Fourteen insecticides of different chemical groups were tested against <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> complex I. e Cypermethrin (0. 015 %), Lambda Cyhalothrin (0. 05 %), Deltamethrin (0. 04 %) and Quinolphos (0. 03 %) were highly effective in controlling <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> complex giving good knock down effect. Farmers use insecticides of different groups injudiciously which pose serious problems like killing of natural enemies and beneficial-insects, health hazards, environmental pollution. Neem contains Alkaloids, ie. Azadirachtin which act as repellent, antifedent {{can be a}} part of insect pest management. Four different concentrations of neem is use to control insect pest and protect crop as well to avoid environmental pollution...|$|R
