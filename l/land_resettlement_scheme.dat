40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{commonly}} used in the developing countries to leverage poor peoples access to land for shelter, food production, or boosting rural development. Unfortunately, not many <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes</b> have effectively solved the problems {{they were designed to}} tackle. For researchers and policymakers in particular, part of the problem has been the lack of enabling analytical tools for holistic and an in-depth analysis of the trajectories of the few successful models of <b>land</b> <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes.</b> The current study examines the features {{of one of the most}} successful <b>land</b> <b>resettlement</b> initiatives, namely the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) scheme in Malaysia. Established in 1956, the scheme comprises over 400 settler communities that cover about 16 of Malaysias total land area. The FELDA scheme has tremendously transformed the lives of the landless population through provision of shelter, jobs, income from agribusiness shareholding, and ownership of highly valorised land titles. This study combined the path dependency approach and Earth system governance analytic tools to examine the trajectories and multidimensional features that make the FELDA scheme a good example to reckon with. Thus, broadening researchers and policymakers appreciation of the role of analytical dimensions is a major contribution of this study to the current debates on the pro-poor land governance strategies in the Global South. Finally, the study shines some light at the role of land governance in streamlining land development and goals of sustainable national planning...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of agrarian change {{presented in this}} thesis integrates state practices and wider politics {{to the study of}} rural differentiation, using a case study of Zimbabwe. Most studies of agrarian change in the 21 st century have tried {{to come to grips with}} rural differentiation in Africa, its causes and effects, by using particular models such as those of neo-classical economics, livelihood approaches, Marxist {{analysis of}} accumulation and social and cultural networks, or a combination of variables from the four approaches. However, these theoretical approaches fail to comprehensively integrate the role of the state and politics into the analysis of rural differentiation. My study explains differentiation by exploring beneficiary selection, production and accumulation processes on Zimbabwe’s Fast Track <b>land</b> reform <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes.</b> Fast Track involved a series of partisan and violent invasions of largely white owned commercial farms from 2000, which constituted the largest land redistribution in post-colonial Africa. Scholars exploring politics and the Zimbabwean state have not applied their insights to an analysis of field based data on production and accumulation on Zimbabwe’s resettlement farms. I argue that the restructuring of the state and politics as an instrument of violence and as a site of accumulation dominated by patronage-both justified through ideology-was central to agrarian change after 2000. I find the three concepts of violence, patronage and ideology more useful in capturing the nuances and modalities of empirical realities on <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes</b> than neo-patrimonial theories that provide generalised accounts of the African state. Though still acknowledging the role of other differentiating factors such as social networks, hard work by resettled farmers and economic factors, it is through the integration of political processes into the analysis of agrarian change that, I argue, one can understand better the dynamics shaping rural differentiation in post- 2000 Zimbabwe.

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the social construction}} and reconstruction of gender roles in relation to agricultural knowledge claims in a <b>land</b> <b>resettlement</b> area. Many women were politically active {{in the war of}} liberation where the land question dominated the agenda. However, at independence this question was framed in terms of race, and gender issues were sidelined. Despite the fact that women were not resettled in their own right, they are not simply victims of the system but manoeuvre within the system to gain advantages. This paper discusses strategies that women use to challenge the males in their families and the resultant conflicts and contradictions. It also discusses decision-making, investments and poverty as concepts and practices that can illuminate the gendering and gendered nature of knowledge in <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes.</b> Claims of knowledge by both men and women are in the final analysis claims to the ownership of household and family resources. ...|$|R

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} rural {{resettlement}} and contract farming in Zimbabwe. Until {{the introduction of}} the structural adjustment programme, post independent smallholder agriculture in Zimbabwe’s <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes</b> was dominated by the state (Bratton, 1994). Inspired by the experiences of the socialist countries which had {{played a key role in}} the predominantly land based liberation struggle, the state played, for most <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes,</b> the role of manager, deciding how, when and what was to be grown (Mumbengegwi, 1987). The state could afford to do this because it was the source for all inputs, from seeds fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. This high-handed managerial role was complemented by another sophisticated one: control of marketing. Eager to get as much as possible from the peasants and doubting the ability of peasants to conduct marketing, the state cast itself as the only purchaser of resettlement produce. To capture grain from peasants as well as reduce wastages, the state installed, as everywhere in Africa, marketing depots, filling up these with state functionaries (Bates, 1981; Berry, 1984; Scott, 1998). For various reasons including those relating to the collapse of socialism, the state’s dominant role in resettlement agriculture has, now, been dismantled and from its ruins has emerged a new regime based on partnership with private business. With inputs in hand and assured markets for every crop sown under contract, private business promises a lighter yoke to the smallholder. While these partnerships now mark the landscape and continue to multiply with each new <b>resettlement</b> <b>scheme,</b> there is very little research problematising them. Even though there is a rich corpus of knowledge about contract farming elsewhere (Watts and Little, 1994; Barnett, 1984), we still do not know how these contracts are framed. There remains an agenda to unravel how these contracts are formed as well as to illuminate their nature. Could it be that these contracts are ambiguous on obligations of buyers and clear on obligations of growers? And what has been the impact of these contracts on the growers? These are pertinent questions as those touching on the significance of these contracts on the Zimbabwe’s unfolding <b>resettlement</b> and <b>land</b> reform programme. This paper represents an attempt to understand these new relationships in the context of <b>land</b> <b>resettlement</b> in Zimbabwe. In particular, I seek to understand how these agrarian contracts are framed, and what this framing means for smallholders. But I also seek to understand whether contract farming can complement and enrich the ongoing <b>land</b> reform and <b>resettlement</b> programme, which has tended to be mechanistic and state driven...|$|R

40|$|Student Number : 0318769 R - PhD thesis - School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies - Faculty of ScienceThis {{thesis is}} about the {{relationship}} between planned resettlement, livelihoods and environmental resources in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwean resettlement areas, assets such as human and physical capital, social networks and financial resources are often clearly insufficient to adequately provide inputs for the sustainable productive and extractive systems that are required to drive the rural economy. Due to uncertainties related to agricultural production doubts have been expressed about the benefits of state sponsored resettlement. Currently, debate is raging on whether <b>land</b> <b>resettlement</b> in Zimbabwe has yielded the intended benefits among land reform beneficiaries, with some scholars even questioning whether state sponsored resettlement is not merely an expensive way of reproducing the livelihoods of communal lands. This thesis contributes to the ongoing debate about the link between rural livelihoods and <b>land</b> <b>resettlement,</b> using the case of Mufurudzi <b>resettlement</b> <b>scheme</b> in Zimbabwe. Based on a livelihood framework, the thesis argues that in order to fully understand the relationship between land reform and livelihoods, livelihood trajectories have to be examined. In line with this thinking the thesis presents a number of arguments. First, the thesis argues that there are many theoretical frameworks for analyzing the relationship between people, resettlement and environmental resources such as forests and woodlands and the sustainable livelihood framework is just one of them. Second, resettlement does not necessarily always lead to environmental destruction. Instead resettlement provides the mechanism for unlocking the natural capital that local communities require for survival. Forest and woodland resources are one such form of natural capital. Under these circumstances access to natural capital, particularly in the form of forest and woodland resources, becomes the cornerstone of survival, notwithstanding the role that these resources play in supplying daily livelihood requirements such as food, shelter, fuel, medicines and other needs, in a harsh macro-economic environment. Apart from providing important products, forest and woodland resources also provide a mechanism through which land reform beneficiary communities can diversify their livelihoods. The key finding of this research is that despite their continual use during the past 25 years no wholesale degradation has occurred to the forest and woodland resources in Mufurudzi. Informal CBNRM is responsible for this situation...|$|R

The study adopted a mixed approach in its data collection and analyses. Of the eight communities affected by Bui hydropower project, and thus require resettlement, four were purposively selected for primary data collection. Primary data was gathered through questionnaire administration to 157 heads of resettled households, focus group discussions with men and women and in-depth interviews with key informants. The findings indicated that the affected people had been sufficiently contacted at all levels of their resettlement. In particular, the Ghana Dams Dialogue, which served as a liaison entity {{between the government and the}} resettlement communities came up for praise for its usefulness. Many tangible policies were put in place to address the socio-cultural differences of traditional authorities.

However, loss of jobs or conversion to less preferable or beneficial occupations caused by the project has affected their satisfaction level. In addition, inequality of access to options of the <b>resettlement</b> <b>scheme</b> has caused differences in socio-economic status among the resettlers. Furthermore, in the long term, the option has also failed to indemnify resettlers from lost livelihoods due to environmental and socio-economic constraints.

Questions are been asked whether those schemes were actually achieved expected objectives, giving a foundation to start {{new life in the}} place of resettlement. Option found that this was not the case. Scheme itself has become a burden not only for the occupants but also it rarely fits into broad environment of the place of resettlement leading to serious of new problems. This is to understand the post-resettlement scenario of a resettlement project - Displaced <b>Resettlement</b> <b>scheme</b> of Oluvil Harbour. A large number of fisher folk and others living along the beach had to be forcibly displaced for the purpose of a harbour project recently initiated in Oluvil of Southeast coast of Sri Lanka. The study is about suitability and sustainability of the project from beneficiary perspectives. The study based on interviews and focused group discussion of different types residences of this resettlement project and village. The study finds the following: this resettlement of this village was started in 2007 - 2008 with the purpose of facilitating and accommodating the development of port harbour in Oluvil. People who displaced were to leave their ancestral land, properties and own houses to response to the requirements for port development. Before leaving the port development area they were doing fishing for their daily livelihood and family management and make contribution to their social well being. Educationally they had limited benefits and economically they were very poor. But living happily as that environment was comfortable to their daily activities. At present, they are facing many difficulties and shortcomings in this new village of resettlement. They are unable to go the sea to do fishing for their daily income as that area is reserved for port development. Investigation also revealed that the residences of the resettlement were not happy about place of relocation, design of the houses, the way the houses were allocated, facilities provided within and outside of the scheme, and infrastructure facilities etc. Findings from the study raise many questions concerning many on-going <b>resettlement</b> <b>schemes.</b> Are these for the purpose of the recovery of the displaced? If these schemes have failed achieved the said objectives on the study, where it will lead to?
