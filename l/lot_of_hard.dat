25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads.

In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome.

Cronenberg stated {{that he wanted to}} cast Sissy Spacek in the film lead, but the studio vetoed his choice because of her accent. Spacek's film Carrie was released during this film's production and proved to be a massive hit (and a movie poster for the film appears when the main character walks by a movie theater at 59:15). The director says that the idea of casting Chambers came from producer Ivan Reitman, who had heard that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role. Reitman felt that {{it would be easier to}} market the film in different territories if the well-known porn star portrayed the main character. Cronenberg stated that Chambers put in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work on the film and that he was impressed with her.

However, his extreme temperament led Kakuzu to dislike having a partner and eventually killing whomever he is partnered with {{in a fit of}} rage, being paired up with the immortal Hidan as a result. When Kakuzu was still living in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage, but the mission has failed. Defeated and humiliated, Kakuzu returned to his village, where he received a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> punishments. Feeling a great hatred for their fellow village, Kakuzu escape from prison and stole the forbidden techniques of his village, becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed {{of a large number of}} black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, being his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use and integrates their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart. Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi. After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu's Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.|$|E
