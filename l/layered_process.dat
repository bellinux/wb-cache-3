40|$|Baroclinic eddy {{equilibration}} and {{the roles}} of different boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> in limiting the baroclinic adjustment are studied using an atmosphere–ocean thermally coupled model. Boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> not only affect the dynamical constraint of the midlatitude baroclinic eddy equilibration but also are important components in the underlying surface energy budget. The authors' study shows that baroclinic eddies, with the strong mixing of the surface air temperature, compete against the fast boundary layer thermal damping and enhance the meridional variation of surface sensible heat flux, acting to reduce the meridional gradient of the surface temperature. Nevertheless, the requirement of the surface energy balance indicates that strong surface baroclinicity is always maintained {{in response to the}} meridionally varying solar radiation. With the strong surface baroclinicity and the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes,</b> the homogenized potential vorticity (PV) suggested in the baroclinic adjustment are never observed near the surface or in the boundary layer. Although different boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> affect baroclinic eddy equilibration differently with more dynamical feedbacks and time scales included in the coupled system, their influence in limiting the PV homogenization is more uniform compared with the previous uncoupled runs. The boundary layer PV structure is more determined by the strength of the boundary layer damping than the surface baroclinicity. Stronger boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> always prevent the lower-level PV homogenization more efficiently. Above the boundary layer, a relatively robust PV structure with homogenized PV around 600 – 800 hPa is obtained in all of the simulations. The detailed mechanisms through which different boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> affect the equilibration of the coupled system are discussed in this study. United States.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{influence}} of boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> and seasonal forcing on baroclinic eddy equilibration is studied {{to understand how the}} baroclinic adjustment is modified when taking into account these two factors. A modified [beta] plane multilevel quasi-geostrophic (QG) model with an interactive stratification and a simplified parameterization of atmospheric boundary layer physics is used as the atmospheric model in this study. Comparisons between experiments with the modified QG model and the traditional QG model with fixed stratification show {{that it is necessary to}} include the interaction between vertical eddy heat flux and stratification to obtain a realistic equilibrated state, i. e. robust isentropic slope. A slab surface model is also coupled with the atmospheric model to provide an interactive surface temperature distribution in some experiments in this study. The effect of boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> is first studied under the situation with fixed underlying surface temperature. The boundary layer vertical thermal diffusion, along with the surface heat exchange, is found primarily responsible for the limitation of the PV homogenization in the boundary layer. The boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> can influence the eddy activity in at least two competing ways. First, in the eddy energy budget, all the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> act to damp the eddy energy directly. On the other hand, the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> also influence the mean flow, which can further influence the eddy behavior. For the boundary layer thermal damping, the indirect effect on the eddy activity becomes dominant. (cont.) Stronger boundary layer thermal forcing results in stronger meridional temperature gradients and eddy heat fluxes. For the frictional dissipation, the resulting changes in the zonal wind and in the location of the critical latitude lead to a meridional variation of the eddy forcing, which can further result in a non-monotonic response of the mean flow. The role of the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> in the baroclinic eddy equilibration is further studied using a simple air-sea thermally coupled model. Although in the coupled system, each boundary <b>layer</b> <b>process</b> has more and different ways to influence the equilibrium state, their effect on the lower level PV homogenization is very robust. Surface friction and surface 3 heat flux all act to damp the lower level PV mixing and stronger surface damping prevents the PV homogenization more strongly, but the way in which each boundary <b>layer</b> <b>process</b> affects the PV homogenization is very different. Baroclinic eddy equilibration under seasonal forcing is studied in both the atmospheric model and the coupled model. In the situation with specified seasonal variation of the underlying surface temperature, a Northern-Hemisphere like seasonal variation of the surface temperature is used to act on the atmospheric flow through the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>processes</b> and the radiative-convective heating. (cont.) Under slowly varying seasonal forcing, the eddy and the mean flow behavior is characterized by four clearly divided time intervals: an eddy inactive time interval in the summer, a mainly dynamically determined eddy spinup time interval starting from mid-fall and lasting less than one month, a quasi-equilibrium time interval for the zonal mean flow available potential energy from late fall to late spring and a mainly external forcing determined eddy spindown time interval from late winter to late spring. In spite of the strong seasonality of the eddy activity, a robust PV structure is still observed through all the seasons. It is found that besides baroclinic eddies, the boundary layer thermal forcing as well as the moist convection all can help maintain the lower level PV structure. The sensitivity study of the eddy equilibration to the time scale of the external forcing also indicates that the time scale separation between the baroclinic adjustment and the external forcing in midlatitudes is only visible for external forcing cycle one year and longer. The seasonality study with the coupled model confirms the conclusions obtained in the uncoupled model. by Yang Zhang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|We applied Markov Stability {{across a}} broad span of Markov times (t∈ [0.01, 100] in steps of 0.01) to the MST-kNN {{similarity}} graph of N= 3229 incident records. At each Markov time, we ran 500 independent optimisations of the Louvain algorithm and selected the optimal partition at each time. Repeating the optimisation from 500 different initial starting points enhances the robustness of the outcome and allows us to quantify the robustness of the partition to the optimisation procedure. To quantify this robustness, we computed the average variation of information VI(t) (a measure of dissimilarity) between the top 50 partitions for each t. Once the full scan across Markov time was finalised, a final comparison of all the optimal partitions obtained was carried out, so as to assess {{if any of the}} optimised partitions was optimal at any other Markov time, in which case it was selected. We then obtained the VI(t,t′) across all optimal partitions found across Markov times to ascertain when partitions are robust across levels of resolution. This <b>layered</b> <b>process</b> of optimisation enhances the robustness of the outcome given the NP-hard nature of MS optimisation, which prevents guaranteed global optimality.|$|E

As this ideology of market logic consolidates its hegemony in universities of excellence and US culture at large, academic socialization and disciplinary activities increasingly aim to create scholarly dispositions and subjectivities that align with it.
