40|$|ObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{validity}} of measuring changes of sub bandage pressure and <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> in different body positions for an in vivo characterization of the elastic properties of bandage systems. DesignExperimental study. Materials and methodsDifferent compression bandages were applied on the leg. The variations of interface pressure and <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> above the inner ankle (that depends on the elastic property of the bandage) were measured simultaneously by a pressure transducer and by strain-gauge plethysmography in 50 patients. Stiffness {{is defined as the}} increase of pressure per increase of circumference. ResultsThe most consistent parameter to differentiate elastic from inelastic bandages was the pressure-difference between the standing and the lying position corrected for the actual increase of <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> (modified static stiffness index, mSSI; sensitivity and specificity 100 %). Neglecting the individual changes of the circumference and considering the pressure difference alone allows a differentiation which is slightly less accurate (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 88 %) but much simpler to use. ConclusionsThe static stiffness index is a useful tool to differentiate elastic from inelastic bandage material even without correction for the individual increase of <b>leg</b> <b>circumference...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and upper and lower arm as well as lower <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences</b> and the frequency of correct blood pressure (BP) cuff fit. We explored recommendations for the most likely BP cuff size and location for the three BMI categories. Materials and Methods: Following IRB approval we retrospectively analyzed a research database of bariatric surgical patients with a BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m 2. Data included patients′ characteristics, upper and lower arm as well as lower <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences.</b> Patients were divided into three groups based on BMI (kg/m 2, Group I: 55). Appropriate cuff fit using a standard or large adult BP cuff (CRITIKON ®, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) on the upper and lower arm, and lower leg was determined. We analyzed the percent proportion of proper cuff fit for cuff sizes and locations between groups using appropriate nonparametric testing. Results: Limb circumference correlated significantly with BMI (P = 0. 01), and the upper arm correlated most closely (r = 0. 76). A standard adult BP cuff on the lower arm fit properly in > 90 % and > 80 % and in Groups I and II, respectively. A large cuff on the lower arm was appropriate in 87 % of Group III. In two participants, a large cuff fit properly on the lower <b>leg.</b> Discussion: Limb <b>circumference</b> significantly correlated with BMI.

40|$|Measurement of leg {{swelling}} {{is widely}} used {{for the evaluation of}} the load in standing work. Measuring the <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> with a tape measure and the leg volume in a water tank were methods often used to measure the level of leg swelling 1).

Methods: In a prospective randomized trial, patients were {{assigned to one of}} two groups. All patients suffered from peripheral arterial disease, and all were subjected to autologous femoropopliteal bypass reconstruction. Patients in group 1 used a compression stocking (CS) above the knee exerting 18 mmHg (class I) on the leg postoperatively for 1 week (day and night). Patients in group 2 used IPC on the foot postoperatively at night for 1 week. The lower <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> was measured preoperatively and at five postoperative time points. A multivariate analysis was done using a mixed model analysis of variance. Results: A total of 57 patients were analyzed (CS 28; IPC 29). Indications for operation were severe claudication (CS 13; IPC 13), rest pain (10 / 5), or tissue loss (7 / 11). Revascularization was performed with either a supragenicular (CS 13; IPC 10) or an infragenicular (CS 15; IPC 19) autologous bypass. <b>Leg</b> <b>circumference</b> increased on day 1 (CS/IPC) : 0. 4 %/ 2. 7 %, day 4 (2. 1 %/ 6. 1 %), day 7 (2. 5 %/ 7. 9 %), day 14 (4. 7 %/ 7. 3 %), and day 90 (1. 0 %/ 3. 3 %) from baseline (preoperative situation).

This study reports {{the efficiency of}} SFV as conduit for infra-inguinal reconstructions and characterize the anatomic and physiologic changes in harvest limbs {{and their relationship to}} the development of venous complications. METHODS: From May 1999 through November 2003, 23 SFV were harvested from 21 patients undergoing infra-inguinal reconstructions. Bypasses were controlled by regular duplex-ultrasound. The venous morbidity was assessed by measurements of <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences,</b> strain-gauge plethysmography and quality of life, investigated by the VEINES-QOL scale. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 10. 4 months (range 1 - 56), primary, secondary patency and limb salvage rates of infra-inguinal bypasses using SFV are 71. 4 %, 76. 2 % and 85. 7 % respectively. No patient had major venous claudication. Oedema was significantly present in nine patients. Strain-gauge plethysmography showed outflow obstruction in all patients.

40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} influences on muscle circumference {{measurements of the}} extremities were estimated in 105 pairs of twins between 10 and 14 yr of age. Four circumferences, extended upper arm (EAC), forearm (FC), thigh (TC), and calf (CC), were measured. Univariate model fitting revealed that the largest part (87 - 95 %) of the variance for all circumferences at most ages was explained by additive genetic factors. Sex differences were observed for some age categories. Multivariate analyses showed a different pattern evolving according to age and gender. In boys from 10 to 12 yr of age, one general genetic factor influenced all four circumferences. With increasing age, an arm-leg model emerged, one genetic factor influencing the arm and another genetic factor the <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences.</b> In young girls one genetic factor loaded on the proximal (EAC, TC) and another on the distal (FC, CC) circumferences. With subjects at age 14 yr, an arm-leg model was observed. High genetic correlations indicated that genetic factors related to EAC, FC, TC, and CC did not act independently. The age-and gender-specific changes in the genetic structure suggest pubertal influences. This study shows that muscle circumferences are highly heritable characteristics {{and are therefore a}} promising starting point at which to locate their genes.

40|$|Objectives Natriuretic {{peptides}} control cardiovascular functions through diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilatory properties. Several anthropometric, cardiac and renal {{variables were}} found to be independently correlated to their levels. Few studies, however, systematically investigated the independent determinants of natriuretic peptide levels in large populations. Design The present analysis was carried out in a large unselected sample of adult male population in Southern Italy (The Olivetti Heart Study, n = 806 men, mean age = 59. 5, range 35 - 82 years). We examined the relationship of plasma natriuretic peptide-proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) levels with relevant anthropometric, clinical and biochemical variables; the impact of age; and the association of NT-proANP levels with cardiovascular risk. Results NT-proANP was directly associated to age, pulse pressure (PP), renal sodium fractional excretion (FENa) (P< 0. 005), and inversely to diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), creatinine clearance, body mass index (BMI), arm and <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences</b> (P< 0. 005). After adjustment for age, DBP, creatinine clearance, FENa and HR remained independent determinants of NT-proANP levels (all P< 0. 01, cumulative R(2) = 0. 186). Upon stratification of our population by tertile of age, NT-proANP was significantly associated (P <= 0. 01) to arm circumference in the lowest age tertile (mean age 53. 8 years), and to FENa, DBP and creatinine clearance in the highest tertile (mean age 66. 7 years). A direct significant association between NT-proANP levels and cardiovascular risk score, estimated by two independent algorithms, was observed (P< 0. 001). Conclusions Anthropometric, cardiovascular and renal factors exerted a different impact on NT-proANP levels at different ages in our study population.

40|$|Purpose: The {{clinical}} {{target volume}} (CTV) of post-operative radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs conventionally includes {{the whole of}} the transverse cross-section of the affected anatomical compartment. In the anterior thigh sartorius appears to lie within its own fascial compartment and can be safely excluded. We investigated the potential impact of omitting sartorius from the anterior muscle compartment on patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the thigh. Patients and methods:We used the planning CT data from six patients who had previously received post-operative radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the thigh. The anterior compartments were outlined twice, initially including and then excluding the sartorius muscle. The volumes of the anterior compartment (i. e., the CTVs), both with and without sartorius, and the corresponding planning target volumes (PTVs) were calculated. Treatment plans were prepared for each PTV. For both volumes the unirradiated normal tissue corridor was outlined on each CT slice. The volume and circumference of the unirradiated corridor were then calculated. Results: For all six patients there was an important improvement in normal tissue sparing by excluding sartorius. The mean reduction in volume of the anterior compartment when sartorius was excluded was 10 % (95 % Confidence Interval 8 – 12 %), whilst the mean decrease in PTV was 11 % (95 % CI 7 – 14 %). There was a substantial increase in the volume of the unirradiated normal tissue corridor, with a mean value of 77 % (95 % CI 41 – 114 %) when sartorius was excluded. In addition, the percentage increase {{in the size of the}} unirradiated normal tissue corridor, expressed as a percentage of the whole <b>leg</b> <b>circumference,</b> was 10 % (95 % CI 8 – 13 %). When sartorius was included in the anterior compartment, the circumference of the unirradiated corridor was less than one-third of the whole <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> in four of the six patients. When sartorius was excluded, the circumference of the unirradiated corridor was greater than one-third of the <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> over the entire length of the target volume in all patients. Discussion: It is essential to know the anatomy of the sartorius muscle to be able to exclude it from the anterior compartment. The increase in the size of the normal tissue corridor when sartorius is excluded should deliver clinical advantage by decreasing the normal tissue adverse effects. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

A crossbreeding study to compare the use of Texel, Dorper, Suffolk and Rambouillet rams as terminal sires on fine wool type sheep was conducted at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. Two-hundred fifty-five multiparous Rambouillet ewes were randomly divided into four breeding groups and mated to rams representing the test breeds. Ewes were maintained on native grass pastures and supplemented with concentrate or dry hay, when forage sources were deemed insufficient to meet ewes' dietary requirements according to NRC (1985) for gestating and lactating ewes. Ewes lambed and were maintained on pasture through weaning. Data collected and analyzed included birth weights, lamb vigor scores and death loss prior to weaning. Lambs were weaned at average age of 90 d, weaning weights were taken and adjusted for age, sex, and type of birth/rearing. Seventy-eight lambs, 20 from each of the Rambouillet, Suffolk, Texel and 18 from the Dorper subgroups, were placed in the feedlot portion of this study. Lambs were fed ad libitum for 78 d. Refusals were weighed back weekly and feed conversions calculated. After a 12 hr shrink, final weights were obtained, post weaning average daily gain calculated, and lambs were slaughtered.

Several anthropometric, cardiac and renal {{variables were}} found to be independently correlated to their levels. Few studies, however, systematically investigated the independent determinants of natriuretic peptide levels in large populations. DESIGN: The present analysis was carried out in a large unselected sample of adult male population in Southern Italy (The Olivetti Heart Study, n = 806 men, mean age = 59. 5, range 35 - 82 years). We examined the relationship of plasma natriuretic peptide-proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) levels with relevant anthropometric, clinical and biochemical variables; the impact of age; and the association of NT-proANP levels with cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: NT-proANP was directly associated to age, pulse pressure (PP), renal sodium fractional excretion (FENa) (P < 0. 005), and inversely to diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), creatinine clearance, body mass index (BMI), arm and <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences</b> (P < 0. 005). After adjustment for age, DBP, creatinine clearance, FENa and HR remained independent determinants of NT-proANP levels (all P < 0. 01, cumulative R = 0. 186). Upon stratification of our population by tertile of age, NT-proANP was significantly associated (P <or= 0. 01) to arm circumference in the lowest age tertile (mean age 53. 8 years), and to FENa, DBP and creatinine clearance in the highest tertile (mean age 66. 7 years). A direct significant association between NT-proANP levels and cardiovascular risk score, estimated by two independent algorithms, was observed (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometric, cardiovascular and renal factors exerted a different impact on NT-proANP levels at different ages in our study population. Higher NT-proANP levels were associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

40|$|Orthostatic {{tolerance}} is impaired {{following an}} acute bout of exercise. This {{study examined the}} effect of fluid ingestion following treadmill exercise in restoring the cardiovascular responses to an orthostatic stress. Five men (age, 29. 6 +/- 3. 4 yrs) were exposed to a graded lower body negative (LBNP) pressure protocol (0 to - 50 mmHg) during euhydration without exercise (C), 20 minutes after exercise dehydration (D), 20 minutes after exercise and fluid ingestion (FI 20), and 60 minutes after exercise and fluid ingestion (FI 60). Fluid ingestion (mean +/- SE) consisted of water-ingestion equivalent to 50 % of the body weight lost during exercise (520 +/- 15 ml). Exercise dehydration resulted in significantly higher heart rates (119 +/- 8 vs 82 +/- 7 bpm), lower systolic blood pressures (95 +/- 1. 7 vs 108 +/- 2. 3 mmHg), a smaller increase in <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> (3. 7 +/- 4 vs 6. 9 +/- 1. 0 mm), and an attenuated increase in total peripheral resistance (2. 58 +/- 1. 2 vs 4. 28 +/- 0. 9 mmHg/L/min) at - 50 mmHg LBNP compared to the C condition. Fluid ingestion (both 20 and 60), partially restored the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance responses to LBNP, but did not influence the change in <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> during LBNP (4 +/- 0. 3 for R 20 and 2. 8 +/- 0. 4 mm for R 60). These data illustrate the effectiveness of fluid ingestion on improving orthostatic responses following exercise, and suggest that dehydration is a contributing factor to orthostatic intolerance following exercise...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{different}} morphometric dimensions were monitored on 106 lamb carcasses {{belonging to}} three Catalan meat sheep breeds (Ripollesa, Rousillon Red and Xisqueta). Our {{purpose was to}} examine differences with regard to measurable carcass dimensions and also to establish between and within breed relationships among the carcass components. Measured variables included: carcass weight (CW), leg length (LL), carcass internal length (IL), carcass length (CL), chest width (ChW), hip width (HW), chest depth (CD), <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> (LC) and chest circumference (CC). From these measurements seven indices were obtained. Roussillon Red carcasses were the shortest, with the largest leg capacity, the lowest corporal index and giving a sense of"squareness". Xisqueta carcasses presented the longest leg length. Ripollesa carcasses were the smallest in chest circumference. The rest of the variables were similar between breeds...|$|E
40|$|In this sudy {{we present}} the {{morphological}} characteristics of 54 Croatian national level track-and-field athletes. 21 anthropometric body measures were {{taken on a}} sample of 15 sprinters (S), 16 endurance sprinters (S 4), 10 middle-distance runners (MD) and 13 long-distance runners (LD). Body fat percentage, body mass index and somatotype were also calculated. Canonical discriminative analysis showed {{significant difference between the}} athletes of various running events, in the measures of body volume and body fat, while no significant difference was found in the variables of longitudinal and transversal dimensions of the skeleton. ANOVA and Student t-test for independent samples showed statistically significantly higher thigh and lower <b>leg</b> <b>circumference</b> in sprinters, as well as greater upper arm skinfold in middle- distance runners.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of artificial shading on weight gain and meat quality of male Nellore cattle in an intensive production system. The experiment was conducted in the experimental feedlot of the Course of Animal Science at Universidade Estadual de Goiás, from July to October 2014. Forty-eight male Nellore cattle with an average initial weight of 310 kg were kept in double 24 -m 2 stalls, in a total of 24 stalls. Of these, six were in the open air; six were covered with black shade netting of 30 % light interception; six with black shade netting 50 %; and six with black shade netting 80 %, providing 6 m 2 of shade per stall. The ration supplied to the animals and the orts left in the trough were weighed daily to determine intake, and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was measured twice weekly. Animals were weighed for the first time at the start of the experiment, and then another three times until the end, which was followed by the slaughter and assessments of performance and meat quality. A difference (p 0. 05) was observed for feed intake, initial weight, final weight, total weight gain, average daily weight gain, carcass yield, marbling, texture, fatness, backfat thickness, loin-eye area, color, thigh length and <b>circumference,</b> <b>leg</b> length and <b>circumference,</b> or carcass length between the animals on the different treatments. The use of artificial shading does not have a significant effect on performance or meat quality of feedlot Nellore cattle when the ambient temperature is within the thermal comfort zone...|$|R
40|$|Objective. In {{order to}} prevent the last stages of chronic venous {{insufficiency}} of the lower limbs, a case-control study was performed to identify and quantify demographic and clinical risk factors for venous ulcer disease. A particular attention was given to history of superficial as well as deep vein thrombosis. Patients and method. Patients presenting to a participating vascular surgery department between January and December 1997 with a first open venous ulcer served as cases. Controls were sampled among patients with sub-acute conditions such as back pain, cold, headache/migraine, sore throat and mild ear infections and were matched on referral, age (+/- 5 years), and gender. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older and had {{a good understanding of}} English or French. They were excluded if they had non-palpable pedal pulse or any chronic active diseases such as cancer or AIDS. Cases' status were ascertained by participating vascular surgeons using a standardized and objective protocol. Data on risk factors were collected with a valid and reliable interviewer-administered questionnaire developed and tested for face validity and reliability before the beginning of the study. The questionnaire has 54 items and explores areas such as obesity, disease antecedents, services utilization, lifestyles, work history, as well as pregnancy and menopause status in women. Inter-rater reliability was high and above 75 % for all 54 items. <b>Leg</b> <b>circumferences</b> were measured with a Leg-O-Meter and patients were asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire. Results. The mean age of participants was 61 years for cases (n = 102) and 59 years for controls (n = 200). History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR = 17. 6 [2. 9, 106. 8] 95 %), strenuous exercise (OR = 8. 9 [1. 1, 72. 0] 95 %) and family history of venous insufficiency on the mother's side (OR = 6. 8 [1. 9, 24. 3] 95 %) were found to be significant predictors of venous ulcers in matched multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for body mass index (kg/height (m 2)), history of pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, fracture, smoking history, work, number of physician visits in past year, and education. Clinical implications. Venous ulcers are a major public health problem mostly because of the cost associated with treating them. Our study suggests that prevention and adequate treatment of DVT, and monitoring of family history and physical activity will lead to ulcer prevention. This is especially important since there are no effective treatments to prevent ulcer recurrence at the present time...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Wether goats from five breed-types, Boer/Spanish, Spanish/Angora, Boer/Angora, Spanish, and Angora, assigned to grain-fed or pasture-fed, and grain-fed Boer/Spanish intact males were used to conduct this study. After slaughter, carcasses were evaluated for conformation and quality, then fabricated into standard bone-in primals. Leg and loin primals were randomly assigned to oven-broiling as steaks or oven-roasting to determine flavor and palatability of goat meat. Grain-fed racks were assigned to one of 12 packaging and storage treatments to determine shelf-life characteristics of goat meat. Shoulders from each breed-type and feeding treatment were formulated into ground goat patties containing 100 %, 75 %, or 55 % goat meat with ground beef to evaluate flavor and texture of ground goat meat. Grain-fed Boer/Spanish goat carcasses had higher (P< 0. 05) carcass and leg conformation scores, larger (P< 0. 05) rib-eye areas, and greater (P< 0. 05) <b>leg</b> <b>circumferences</b> than other grain-fed breed-types. Except for Angora goats, grain-fed carcasses had superior conformation and heavier live and carcass weights. Grain-fed goat carcasses had greater (P< 0. 05) actual and adjusted fat thickness; higher (P< 0. 05) marbling, feathering, and flank streaking; and lower (P< 0. 05) Warner-Bratzler shear values. After 14 days of refrigerated storage and 2 days of retail display, microbial levels were greater (P< 0. 05) than 6 log?? CFU/cm? on all goat racks or displayed steaks. With increased frozen storage, APCs tended to decrease. Lipid oxidation for frozen, vacuum-package rack primals increased (P< 0. 05) from 3 to 6 months. Retail storage of steaks from frozen goat racks tended to decrease slightly with increased retail display time, indicated by increasing log counts. Goat meat aromatic increased (P< 0. 05) as percentage of goat meat increased in ground goat patties. Increasing the percentage of goat meat from 55 % to 75 % increased (P< 0. 05) musty, grassy/grainy, and gamey aromatics and musty aftertaste. Boer/Spanish grain-fed goat carcasses seem to offer carcass conformation superior to other grain-fed breed-types. Frozen storage is highly recommended for goat meat due to the high rate of microbial spoilage. Increasing lipid oxidation during frozen storage suggested that goat meat be marketed within 3 months of frozen storage. Ground goat patties containing 55 % goat meat had lower levels of negative flavor descriptive attributes...|$|R
