They had been expecting Stockton, and as he did not come it was decided to send Bud down to the mill; in fact, Bud decided the matter himself. He warned Greaser and Herky to keep close watch over Dick and me. Then he rode away. Dick and I resumed our talk about forestry, and as we were {{separated}} by the length of the cave it was necessary to speak loud. So our captors heard every word we said.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Walters, seeing {{he could}} expect {{no help from}} him. [...] "But I'm {{not going to have}} this wooden-faced Scotchman in my room. The fool won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move.</b> If you don't take him away, I'll break the furniture. I can do that, {{although}} I'm not able to throw the big brute out." ...|$|E

The wound was a sword-thrust, {{received}} from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill {{could have saved}} him {{if it had been}} looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, {{as if he were a}} wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{highlighted}} {{the song and}} wrote: [...] "Grey is clever enough to allow herself some measure of silliness -- {{there is absolutely no}} other way to describe the Queen-quoting [...] "C'mon <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Ride"—a <b>move</b> that reveals the seams in her goth-princess persona and makes a good chunk of Don't Look Down come across as nothing more than bubblegum Lana Del Rey." [...] Hitfix wrote: [...] "there are times when there's such a disparity between the strength of the beats vs. the strength of the lyrics that miles separate them, no more so than on [...] "C'mon <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Ride," [...] the first single that came out in December featuring Eminem. The beats are ridiculously infectious and even though the song is meant to be lightheaded, tongue-in-cheek and full of sexual innuendo, the lyrics are so inane: [...] "I'm not like the sluts in this town/They make me blah in my mouth," [...] it's hard to get through it without grimacing." [...] Knox Ville wrote: [...] "More than anything, the Wisconsin native is bold. She made that much clear with the previously released single [...] "C'Mon <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Ride," [...] a grainy carnival of a song in which she coos endless innuendo as Eminem himself channels Pee-wee Her-man singing Queen's [...] "Bicycle Race." [...] Glenn Gamboa was disappointed in her emotionless delivery and he added: [...] "The closest we get to one is playful in the oddly defiant [...] "C'mon, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Ride." [...] NY Post wrote: [...] "They can sound hollow, like [...] "C'mon <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Ride," [...] a silly promise of oral sex. (Eminem's surprisingly crafty guest verse is the highlight.)" [...] NOW magazine noted that the song is inane but predictable, too.|$|R

40|$|The initial impetus of {{this paper}} goes back to 1983 {{when a group of}} M. A. in Literature and Communication {{students}} came to Murdoch University for their annual on-campus weekend. The students were mainly school teachers enrolled in the external mode of the degree and primarily from Western Australia. We chose to discuss Bruce Dawe for obvious reasons. In re-reading my notes with a view to their publication, I was struck both by their provocativeness and {{by the nature of the}} models constructed to interpret Bruce Dawe's poetry. Moreover, the basic outline of Dawe's poetics began to emerge with a strong enough clarity to warrant a somewhat extended examination of his verse. To foreshadow the rest {{of this paper}} what I find in Bruce Dawe is that he writes to a formula and in the discourse of the indicative mood. He has a strong monological presence, no doubt a function of his sense of the 'Australian speaking voice' which does not, as we are told often enough, have to 'resort to any kind of inauthentic vernacular. " Finally, he seems to me to be ideologically unsure of his ground. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>move</b> on to the argument itself...|$|R

I convinced him that I knew much about Egypt. In my eagerness I said too much. He remarked that a Professor's chair would suit me better than {{a seat in the}} conciergerie. I knew more, he said, than he did. It was only by blundering, and letting him think that he had over-estimated my knowledge, that I prevailed upon him to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> the few effects which I have retained into this chamber. It is my first and my last night here.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor explained. [...] "We {{were afraid}} to move him--till you came. In fact, he wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> him. If you say so now, we will take him up." [...] With these words the watchers shifted their {{responsibility}} to her shoulders, uttering sighs of deep relief. Whatever happened now, Mart's will had been secured. At her command they lifted the table on which her husband lay, and the wife walked beside it, unheeding the throngs of silent men walling her path. Every one made way for her, waited upon her, eager to serve her, partly because she was Marshall Haney's wife, but more because of her youth and the brave heart which looked from her clear and candid eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{they would}} go on to record an album in Phoenix, Arizona during December 1969 with producer, Jim Musil, and for a short while {{performed}} under the name Come. Their next album, Dead Man, was recorded in March 1970. Josefus would perform their last concert in Houston, Texas at an auto show, though the group would later reunite in the late 1970s.In 1978, they would reunite with drummer Jerry Ontiberez. They recorded four singles that were released on the Hookah label (Slave Of Fear, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Move</b> You, Hard Luck, & Wheels). In 1990, Josefus, once again, reunited. Doug Tull was found hanged in a jail cell in Austin, Tx, So they joined forces with drummer Leesa Harrington-Squyres (currently with Lez Zeppelin, NYC) and recorded [...] "Son Of Deadman" [...] on Paradise Lost Records. This line-up has performed a handful of shows over the past two decades, one of which was recorded and released-"Halloween 2004". Recently (2011), Bassist Ray Turner, suffered a stroke which rendered him unable to play. Mark Weathers was brought back to the band, after two decades, to take over for Turner. Josefus has performed twice during 2011 and plan to continue performing regionally when Harrington-Squyres is available.|$|E

The subject of my study was fairly new to us all, and they <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> in any direction which I found interesting, and shape my study more or less as I wanted. A special thanks goes out to Professor Enrique Zuazua from Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, who supervised my seven month stay in Madrid. It was a unique opportunity for me to study the research of Professor Zuazua and his colleagues and students. I learned a lot and found the focus points of my own research during this stay. I also thank Michael Jacobsen and Jesper Grooss with whom I, in turn, shared a DTU office. Apart from being good friends, they patiently listened to my research problems and theories, whenever I needed some feedback. I furthermore thank Henrik Pilegaard, Mikael Buchholtz and René R. Hansen for good company during lunchtime. I finally thank both Jesper Grooss and my big brother Thomas for good advice and for helping me proofread this thesis...|$|E
40|$|As Editor, I had {{not been}} {{intending}} to contribute to this collection of commentaries, but simply to coordinate the process of assembling them. However, one of our com-mentators unfortunately fell out at a late stage, so, rather than ask someone else at very short notice, I decided {{to step into the}} breach. And — to be truthful — I was rather pleased that the fates had provided me with an excuse to enter such an enticing debate. The first thing to say is that we should all — academics and practitioners alike — be grateful to Jocelyne Bourgon for raising such a large and important set of issues. I would venture the opinion that rather few top civil servants share her capacity to articulate such topics and to take up clear positions on the perpetually slippery ground that lies between public administration as a practice and public administration as an academic field. Her own wide experience and intellectual command of the subject gives her that advantage which, regrettably, few of her peers and few of my academic colleagues can hope to equal. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> to the substance of the Braibant Lecture.

40|$|When I {{look at the}} {{multitude}} of pests and diseases you have here in the United States, it is a miracle {{to me that you}} are still alive today. The United King¬dom is fortunate in having very few bird pests in urban areas. We have the English Sparrow, the starling, and the feral pigeon. We are also a nation of bird lovers, with a large number of organizations that look after the welfare of wild birds. So, we in pest control {{have to be very careful}} in our control procedures. Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> along to our feral pigeon trapping program. Our aims are three-fold. We have to reduce bird numbers faster than they can reproduce. Second¬ly we want to catch the birds without any public notice, and thirdly we want to get at least a 70 % reduction in the population within a short period of time, about 6 - 8 weeks. Theoretically, a pair of pigeons can give rise to a population of 100 in 16 months: this assumes two eggs per clutch, a period of 8 weeks from egg laying to fledgling and sexual maturity at 4 - 5 months. In practise, squab mortality reduces this figure; moreover, less than 40 % of female pigeons may be in breeding condition at any one time. Despite these factors, a pair of pigeons can give rise to a population of 100 in about 30 months. Rapid removal of birds is therefore essential to combat the breeding potential of a flock of pigeons...|$|E

40|$|Issue Four of Internet Archaeology is now complete, {{and with}} it we end {{the first phase of}} the Internet Archaeology project, as funded by eLib. Fortunately, I am pleased to say that eLib was {{sufficiently}} impressed with our first three years that they have agreed to fund us for a further three years. At the end of this period, however, the journal must be self-supporting and this means, unfortunately, that we must now make serious plans for how to charge for access. In its short existence, so far, the World Wide Web has adopted the attitude that if it's on the Web it should be free. Indeed, I have heard of some grant giving bodies stipulating that their publication grants for electronic resources are dependent on free access. This would be fine if subventions could cover all web publication costs but would mean that one of the principles of academic publication would have finally have been lost. At present academic journals, both electronic and paper, accept papers solely on their intrinsic worth regardless of whether or not the author can find sponsorship to cover the cost of publication. Admittedly, large, unfunded papers may take longer to get published. So, if we cannot rely totally on subventions and sponsorship then that inevitably means that you, the readers, have to pay. For details, subscribe to our maillist where any announcements will be made. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>move</b> on to a more palatable subject, the contents of this issue of Internet Archaeology. As usual, we have published a small number of papers, each of which gave us a chance to explore a new aspect of electronic publication. Innovative features in Issue Four are less obvious to the casual reader than in previous issues, but there's a lot happening behind the scenes. Before moving on to look at these features I would like to bid a fond farewell to our first Assistant Editor, Sandra Garside-Neville, and welcome her replacement, Judith Winters. The Assistant Editor shoulders the majority of the burden (if such an enjoyable task could ever be said to be a burden) of producing the journal and the authors of papers in Issue Four have reason to be grateful for their hard work. On their behalf, and yours, I'd like to thank them both publicly. ...|$|E
