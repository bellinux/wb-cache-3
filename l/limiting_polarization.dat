40|$|Fluorescence {{polarization}} measurements in the condensed phase provide rich {{information on}} rotational dynamics and interactions between macromolecules. An important parameter {{in these studies}} is the <b>limiting</b> <b>polarization</b> or po which is the emission polarization {{in the absence of}} molecular rotation. Here we explore how molecular number averaging affects the observed value of po. Using a simple mathematical model we show that for a collection of fluorescent dipoles (1 – 50 molecules) the fluorescence polarization (p) increases with the number of molecules (N) due to the progressive onset of photo-selection with a relation of the form p = po(1 − N−β). This concept is demonstrated experimentally using single molecule polarization measurements of perylene diimide dye molecules in a rigid polymer matrix where it is shown that the average emission polarization increases significantly when the number of molecules per averaging window is increased from 1 to 10 molecules. These results suggest that the definition of <b>limiting</b> <b>polarization</b> needs to be refined in the quasi-single molecule regime. Moreover, these results pave a new way for measuring clustering of molecules from single cluster polarization histograms...|$|E

3000|$|As {{mentioned}} in the introduction, {{the implementation of a}} classical MIMO architecture for applications in the HF band must cope with a problem of available space. Indeed, the reduced angular separation of transmitted rays requires an inter antenna spacing which largely exceeds the equivalent of several wavelengths, the latter having decametric values in the present context. Consequently, the size of antenna arrays would appear prohibitive in a setup based on spatial diversity only [10]. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an alternative solution using relatively compact arrays at both ends of the radio link. The original idea of this work refers to the existence of two propagation modes O and X in the ionosphere. Assuming that one <b>limiting</b> <b>polarization</b> (O or X) is excited at the ionosphere entry thanks to an ad hoc transmitting antenna, the only corresponding propagation mode is observed in the channel and emerges with predictable values of parameters η and α.

40|$|Results of {{intensity}} and polarization measurements of narrow-band auroral hiss observed simultaneously {{with the direction}} finding (DF) observations at Syowa Station, Antarctica, are compared with results of the full-wave calculation in a realistic ionospheric model. The ratios of the 8 kHz hiss intensity observed at Syowa to that at Mizuho Station (about 270 km distant from Syowa in the geomagnetic south direction) depend on the propagation distance from the exit regions {{at the height of}} the lower edge of the ionosphere to the two ground stations. However, the observed ratios (SY/MI) are 2 - 3 dB higher than the corresponding theoretical values. The disagreement is discussed as regards to the effects of the wave polarization and the ground conductivity at the observing site on the received wave intensity. The distribution of R/L (R-to L-handed polarized component) values of the narrow-band auroral hiss observed at Syowa with incident angles indicates a similar tendency to the R/L values for the <b>limiting</b> <b>polarization</b> by full-wave calculation, but the observed values are smaller than the calculated ones.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the general strategy of measuring cosmologically induced polarization {{by analyzing the}} polarization signature in the small scale <b>limit.</b> <b>Polarization</b> induced by cosmological scalar perturbations leads to a typical anisotropy pattern in the power spectrum, which can best be analyzed in Fourier domain. This allows one to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from other foregrounds and systematics, {{as well as from}} polarization induced by non-scalar perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and foreground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our capability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important then a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular combination of Stokes Q and U parameters vanishes for scalar induced polarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes. Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one typically expects a signal at the level of 5 - 10 µK on small angular scales and around 1 µK on large scales (l < 200). Satellite missions should be able to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization, which would help to break the degeneracies in the determination of some of the cosmological parameters...|$|R
