5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. One piece of <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> {{by the new}} Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which {{subjected}} members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|If the Parliament Act 1949 {{were found}} {{not to be}} an Act of Parliament {{on any of the}} above grounds, all <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> using the Parliament Acts since the {{introduction}} of the 1949 Act, including the Hunting Act, would also not be valid Acts of Parliament, being passed only in accordance with the 1949 Act (rejection in two successive sessions and a delay of one year) as opposed to the more onerous requirements of the 1911 Act (rejection in three successive sessions and a delay of two years).|$|E
5000|$|Important <b>legislations</b> <b>passed</b> by the United States Congress {{in early}} United States history were the Indian Intercourse Acts. They were passed in 1780, {{and then they}} expired and were renewed every two years until 1802, when {{permanent}} <b>legislation</b> was <b>passed.</b> The final Indian Intercourse Act was passed in 1834. These acts did many things, including regulating relations between Indians and non-Indians living on Indian land and defining “Indian Country.” ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Legislation</b> <b>passed</b> by the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier}} for police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|Special {{procedures}} {{apply to}} <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> by the Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the lordship of the Island {{was purchased by}} the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative Party, {{in office}} since 1951, had lost {{standing}} {{as a result}} of the Profumo affair, a sexual scandal involving a defence minister in 1963, and at the time of Lord Home's appointment as Prime Minister seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance, bringing costs down for the consumer against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.|$|E

5|$|The call to open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} arrived {{in the area in}} the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas {{went so far as to}} recommend West Texas secede from the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Council of Keewatin {{as well as the}} District of Keewatin was Alexander Morris. He {{selected}} and appointed the members to serve after being given permission by the Government of Canada. After the Council was disbanded in 1877, the <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> and departments organized by the council, such as the Boards of Health and Quarantine, continued to remain in force as late as 1878. The council was not reconstituted before the District of Keewatin was ceded back to the Northwest Territories in 1905. All matters of administration were handled by the Government of Canada and the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, the Canadian {{government}} under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson <b>passed</b> <b>legislation</b> that required senators to retire {{when they reached}} the age of 75.

Also, she <b>passed</b> <b>legislation</b> that expands the Public Safety Commission from 3 to 5 members. Chávez <b>passed</b> <b>legislation</b> {{that will let}} Texas compete with its neighboring states by allowing local communities to offer an exemption on goods-in-transit. She <b>passed</b> <b>legislation</b> to streamline administrative processes at the Health and Human Services Commission by requiring the commissioner to develop guidelines and standards {{to allow for the}} use of electronic signatures. Chávez <b>passed</b> <b>legislation</b> that will require the Texas Bond Review Board to comprehensively review the effect of new debt authorizations and appropriations on debt services on the state's future capacity.|$|R
25|$|Pirro was {{the first}} female {{president}} of the New York State District Attorneys Association. Also while District Attorney, she was appointed by then Governor George Pataki to chair the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board. Its report and recommendations resulted in <b>legislation</b> <b>passing</b> that enhanced protections of, and safeguards for, the victims of domestic abuse.|$|R
5|$|Antisemitic <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> in 1933 led to {{the removal}} all of Jewish teachers, professors and {{officials}} from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E

25|$|The New Zealand Cabinet {{approved}} {{the creation of}} Lotto in February 1986, the necessary <b>legislation</b> <b>passing</b> through Parliament in April that year with a 47–20 vote.

5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself {{to be influenced by}} political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> by his party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, toll roads were gaining in {{popularity}} {{as a mechanism}} for funding new superhighways. This trend started with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, which was mimicked by other toll roads in New York, New Jersey, several New England states, Ohio, and Colorado. In October 1951, the Highway Council of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce researched the possibility of integrating the state into a potential cross-country turnpike system. Eastern Kansas was also included in an interstate turnpike system stretching from Galveston, Texas to Saint Louis, Missouri, via Kansas City, that was proposed by Oklahoma governor Johnston Murray. Many firms from construction industries, {{as well as those}} concerned about the state's economic development, worked to have <b>legislation</b> <b>passed</b> to allow the turnpike to be constructed. Governor Ed Arn and Gale Moss, the State Highway Director, were two major proponents of the turnpike concept.|$|E
