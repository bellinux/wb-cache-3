5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer {{coat with}} a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E

5000|$|In theory, {{this system}} {{was to be}} {{democratic}} since all leading party organs would be elected from below, but also centralized since <b>lower</b> <b>bodies</b> would be accountable to higher organizations. In practice, [...] "democratic centralism" [...] was centralist, with decisions of higher organs binding on lower ones, and the composition of <b>lower</b> <b>bodies</b> largely determined {{by the members of}} higher ones. Over time, party cadres would grow increasingly careerist and professional. Party membership required exams, special courses, special camps, schools, and nominations by three existing members.|$|R
5|$|Stela 39 is {{a broken}} {{monument}} that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper {{portion of the}} stela is missing but the lower portion shows the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling {{the figure of a}} bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text {{on the back of the}} monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E
5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{responded with}} a career-high 33 points in 2006–07. He notched a personal-best three assists in one game {{late in the season}} in a 3–2 win against the Los Angeles Kings on 27 March 2007. San Jose were once again losers {{in the second round of}} the playoffs, being {{eliminated}} by the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Ehrhoff had two assists in 11 post-season games. His regular season production decreased to 22 points in the 2007–08 season. On 28 December 2007, Ehrhoff was awarded a penalty shot during a game against the St. Louis Blues; he missed against Manny Legace, though the Sharks nonetheless still won, 1–0. Later in the season, Ehrhoff missed four games due to a <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> injury, suffered on 6 April 2008. After finishing as the second seed in the West, San Jose were defeated in the second round against the Dallas Stars. Ehrhoff notched five assists in ten playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5000|$|Drop waist: A low, {{horizontal}} waistline {{that usually}} falls near {{the level of}} the upper hips. Balances the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>bodies,</b> and adds to the visual impression of height by lengthening the torso. Common in 1920s silhouettes.|$|R
25|$|The African threadfish is {{silver in}} colour, often with blue and greenish tints and reflection, {{especially}} when fresh. The fins are all a pale silvery green to blue colour, or hyaline. Juveniles may show two dark bands on their <b>lower</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Prosecution is rare, {{often the}} models are {{difficult}} to visually identify just from images of their often clothed <b>lower</b> <b>bodies.</b> The first arrest was made in 2002, 2 years after the New York police raided the home of Thomas Capriola.|$|R
5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes gliding. Gliding is a <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears {{as if they are}} drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his <b>lower</b> <b>body,</b> along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the <b>lower</b> <b>body.</b> Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the hooded pitohui. Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E

5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch a playoff spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching a playoff spot with a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E
5000|$|Mariliths have {{humanoid}} female upper {{bodies with}} six arms. Depending {{on the particular}} edition and illustrator, their head and torso may look almost human or be covered in reptilian scales. Their <b>lower</b> <b>bodies</b> are those of giant snakes, typically green or brown.|$|R
50|$|Affected {{individuals}} typically experience limited {{relief from}} standard pain relieving medication, {{with the exception}} of some neuroleptic agents. Patients frequently experience ‘pseudovisceral’ phenomena or symptoms of altered autonomic nervous system function including nausea, bloating, abdominal swelling, loss of appetite with consecutively <b>lowered</b> <b>body</b> weight or an altered defecation process.|$|R
50|$|In a {{semicircle}} {{on the sides}} of the back of the stage are the figures of 18 young women popularly known as the muses (although there are only nine muses in Greek mythology). The monotone upper bodies of the women protrude from the wall and their <b>lower</b> <b>bodies</b> are depicted by colorful mosaics that form part of the wall. Each of the women is playing a different musical instrument, and each is wearing a different skirt, blouse, and headdress of elaborate design. In the early days of the Palau, many critics found these figures unsettling or even eerie, but today they are widely regarded as perhaps the best sculptural work in the concert hall. The upper bodies were sculpted by Eusebi Arnau, and the mosaic work of their <b>lower</b> <b>bodies</b> was created by Lluís Bru.|$|R
