5|$|The Maryland Geological Survey {{was formed}} in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency {{determined}} that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E
