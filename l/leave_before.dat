5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to <b>leave</b> <b>before</b> they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|Following her return, {{the carrier}} {{spent six months}} in Australian waters, before a two-month {{deployment}} to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, on 21 June 1981, Melbourne rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the South China Sea. The carrier's deployments {{for the second half}} of the year consisted of two exercises, Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81. A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the decision on a replacement carrier. After docking at Garden Island in December, the carrier was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave. In his haste to shut down the carrier, he failed to deactivate the water pumps, and over 180tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day. Melbourne remained in dock at the start of 1982, and did not <b>leave</b> <b>before</b> the decision regarding her replacement was made.|$|E
5|$|Following the 39th Battalion's {{return to}} Australia, {{the men were}} given a period of <b>leave</b> <b>before</b> 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Initially, {{the plan was to}} reorganise the brigade and rebuild it prior to {{returning}} it to New Guinea, but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and 3rd Battalions—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent to the 16th and 19th Brigades. This came into effect on 3 July 1943 {{and as a result of}} this decision, the Militiamen that had been called up for service were transferred to the 36th Battalion, a Militia battalion from New South Wales, while those who had volunteered for overseas service were sent to the 2/2nd Battalion; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.|$|E

Müncheberg was the 19th member of the Wehrmacht and the 13th fighter pilot who had received this award. Müncheberg claimed his last victory in this theatre on 22 September 1942, claiming 33 victories in total over Russian aircraft, this took his overall score to 116 aerial victories. He was then ordered to the Wolf's Lair where Hitler presented him the Swords to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves. Following the award ceremony he was granted home <b>leave</b> <b>before</b> being appointed Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG77—77th Fighter Wing), replacing Gordon Gollob in this role.|$|E
5|$|In June 1916, the {{battalion}} departed from Alexandria {{to join the}} British Expeditionary Force in France for service on the Western Front; they arrived at Marseilles on 23 June.

The unit was originally designated with providing carrying parties for supplies and ammunition during the battle, but was subsequently pulled into the fighting. Wark commanded a company during the action, until being evacuated to the 7thStationary Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. He was transferred to the 3rdLondon General Hospital in England three days later, and moved again to the 5thAustralian Auxiliary Hospital, Digswell House, Welwyn, on 7 August.

5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to <b>leave</b> <b>before</b> sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
