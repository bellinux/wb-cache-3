40|$|Statement of Problem: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{is the most}} {{frequent}} cause for insomnia in the populace. Snoring is mulled over as the potential factor that can lead the sequel to obstructive sleep apnea. Although the etiology and deterrence measures for snoring are yet to be undoubtedly clarified by our scientific sorority, various means of surgical corrections have been affirmed and put into practice, with a substantial degree of success. Despite this, it is implicit that a noninvasive method of managing obstructive sleep apnea is more relevant for overcoming this condition. Purpose: This manuscript intends to establish how snoring can be controlled prosthodontically by different modalities of scientifically defensible approaches. The most effective among the modalities was affirmed as the investigative analyses of the treatment outcomes with each modality. Novel Methods: Four new methods of managing obstructive sleep apnea - uvula <b>lift</b> <b>appliance,</b> uvula and velopharynx <b>lift</b> <b>appliance,</b> nasopharyngeal aperture guard, and soft palate <b>lift</b> <b>appliance</b> were demonstrated through this article. Clinical Reports: The four new modalities stated and one conventional modality of mandibular advancement appliance for managing obstructive sleep apnea, {{a total of five}} types of appliance therapies, were described with case reports for each. Investigation: Five individuals undergoing the appliance therapy were chosen for each modality. The treatment outcome with each modality was examined by analysis of clinical predictors and also by means of standard investigation, with nasal and oral endoscopic analyses. Result: Among the five types of appliance therapies, the nasopharyngeal aperture guard provided the best treatment outcome in terms of clinical predictors and endoscopic analyses. Conclusion: Nasopharyngeal aperture guard, the novel method stated in this article is the better modality for managing obstructive sleep apnea, among the five different appliance therapies...|$|R

Treatment options of VPD with history of cleft palate repair include surgical and prosthetic interventions in combination with speech therapy. Various surgical techniques, such as pharyngeal flap surgery, sphincter pharyngoplasty and Furlow palatoplasty, have been used, but success rate of the surgical treatment is approximately 50 % [5, 6]. Prosthetic devices for VPD can be alternative treatment method when surgical approach is not considered. Widely used types of these devices, called speech aids, are palatal <b>lift</b> <b>appliance</b> and speech bulb.|$|R
40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{offshore}} Oil & Gas platforms including ones located in the North Sea are reaching {{the end of their}} life-cycle. While there is already proven technology to remove topsides, the exact methodology to remove support structures is yet to be established. Especially, when it concerns large and heavy support elements of Gravity Based Structures. An example of such a structure is a large piece of concrete leg that would be cut off the basement below the water line and recovered on deck using a certain type of <b>lifting</b> <b>appliance.</b> The aim of the thesis is to estimate the forces in lifting cables caused by the dynamic response due to environmental forces acting on the whole system. To achieve this goal, a three-dimensional numerical model is created, with help of the programs Matlab and Maple, which, in particular, can be used to study features of hoisting the concrete legs of Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie and Brent Delta support structures. A real lift case of the leg of Brent Delta's support structure is simulated, using realistic leg dimensions. Such a lift would be executed with help of the Jacket Lift System available of the Pioneering Spirit vessel. Realistic weather conditions considered by using available MetOcean data and translating it into vessel motions using available response amplitude operators. The dynamic response of the whole system has been calculated and the corresponding cable forces of the chosen lifting configuration have been determined. Obtained results have been studied using sensitivity analysis by varying the damping and stiffness coefficients. The complete system has been exposed to variable wave conditions, to obtain values of forces with respect to wave periods and wave heights. The influence of the wind speed has been analysed and translated directly into wave conditions. Different stages of the lift have been simulated and the corresponding dynamic responses have been established. Obtained loads in the cables have been compared to Safe Working Loads considering the relative displacement of the leg with respect to the Jacket Lift System. Finally, different rigging configurations have been studied by varying positions of the spreader bar. The initial motions, without damping, tend to generate large forces in the cables. However, with introduced damping, motions become significantly more periodic and the cable forces decrease. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the execution of the hoist should rather be avoided for wave spectra consisting mainly of short waves. These waves initiate relatively large cable forces in the system. Offshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|A Well Intervention Unit {{performs}} subsea {{intervention on}} different water depths ranging from approximately 800 - 3000 meters. During {{a change of}} operations sites, between two neighbouring wells at different water depths, {{the length of the}} riser must be adjusted. This procedure is time consuming, and excessive cost-rates are the motivation for evaluating a new solution that may reduce the rigging time. In this thesis, it is established a new handling sequence reducing the turnaround time by approximately 20 - 22 hours per trip. Estimated savings is thus 50 - 60 million NOK on a yearly basis. The suggested handling sequence is to elevate the Upper Riser Pack (URP) higher in the tower, leaving enough handling space underneath to retrieve riser elements. This eliminates the need of rigging down the surface stack, hence the turnaround time is reduced. To be able to disconnect riser elements efficiently, while the URP is in the tower, a second yoke is introduced to the handling system. A yoke is a passive <b>lifting</b> <b>appliance,</b> and has to be connected to the main hoisting system, which already holds the Upper Riser Pack. The most convenient solution is therefore to connect the yoke to the Surface Flow Tree, the lowest component in the riser stack (UPR). This indicates that the entire Upper Riser Pack has to be elevated together with the new yoke system during riser retrieval. Suggested commercial solution is a hydraulic lifting yoke provided by National Oilwell Varco. This yoke consists of two weld-less BJ links and a BX 5 elevator. Design specification together with relevant rules and regulations is used to define the load case. Normal operation, accidental heel, and an API-load is used when calculating and simulating the equipment. The API-load is the conservative estimate taken from the API 8 C standard of the rated load, i. e. the design load, multiplied with a safety factor of 2. 25. This is more conservative than DNV and will therefore be used as an additional test case. The new riser handling system were drawn and simulated in SolidWorks. The yoke consist of the elevator assembly and two links. The elevator is a component designed to hold riser elements. The links are connection arms that give the necessary handling space between the Surface Flow Tree and the risers. The final component is the adapter; this component is designed to connect the yoke and the Surface Flow Tree. This component is tailor made for the operation sequence and the existing equipment. It is designed so that no additional modifications have to be made to the Upper Riser Pack. Finally, a strength analysis of the new riser handling equipment is computed, and the results are presented. Some local yielding occurs, especially in the contact regions, but the overall impression is that the equipment satisfies the rules and safety requirements provided by both DNV and API...|$|E

Further, this thesis deals with a design of a crane with a telescopic jib and a single knuckle. An important part of the crane’s design is its kinematic solution, which was modified in the design phase. The last step of a simplified analytical calculation of the jib for design steel construction is given. This preliminary calculation is the starting point for a FEM model and for the following FEM analysis. A stress control is made according to the Lloyd's Register of Shipping agency’s standard for <b>lifting</b> <b>appliances</b> in marine environment and also according to the recommendations of Huisman company. A part of the proposed solution is a selection of main components of the crane. The master’s thesis contains a summary of some operational and other information which characterize possibilities of the crane’s use.
