40|$|Background: Psychopathy is {{a complex}} {{personality}} dis-order of unknown etiology. Central to the disorder are anomalies or difficulties in affective processing. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to elucidate the neurobiological correlates of these anomalies in criminal psychopaths during performance of an affective memory task. Results: Compared with criminal nonpsychopaths and noncriminal control participants, criminal psychopaths showed significantly less affect-related activity in the amygdala/hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gy-rus, ventral striatum, and in the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri. Psychopathic criminals also showed evi-dence of overactivation in the bilateral fronto-temporal cortex for processing affective stimuli.

40|$|SYNOPSIS A case of {{encephalitis}} {{associated with}} a remote and occult oat cell carcinoma is pre-sented in which the main clinical features were progressive dementia and central hypoventilation syndrome. The only significant anatomical lesions within the known anatomical substrate of respira-tion affected the locus caeruleus on both sides. It is speculated that the degeneration of the locus caeruleus {{was responsible for the}} central hypoventilation syndrome. Hitherto undescribed neuronal intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were found in an isolated lesion of the insular cortex.

Hephaestus is an important religious center. A mostly volcanic planet, Hephaestus hosts a town and temple complex of monks who study MysTech. Democratus is climatically similar to Earth, with regions of desert, snow, forest, and prairie. Several populations of different sentient species exist on the surface, but the planet is ruled by a race of tall, thin humanoids with large craniums who dwell on a large mechanical ring constructed around the planet. This race is obsessed with the ideal of democracy, and though they possess incredible scientific and engineering knowledge, they are constantly bogged down by their own ineptitude and the frailties of the democratic process. <b>Limbus</b> {{is known as the}} [...] "planet of death", as voyagers never return; its surface is arid and rocky, with sparse vegetation.

40|$|Arthur Koestler’s Janus–faced holon is {{explored}} as {{characteristic of}} hierarchical levels that pervade the natural order. The self-transcending {{face of the}} holon identifies with an integrating ideal entertained by the conscious intellect that is easily subverted to the emotional desires of the crocodile and the horse wired into our limbic brain. This allows our self-assertive face to act without human conscience thus accounting for the tragic mess we have made of our history. The “flatland ” vision {{of cause and effect}} has ruled the development of the psychological, social, physical and biological sciences while ignoring hierarchies implicit in the cosmic order that pervade all phenomena. The holon is shown to derive from Universal and Particular active interfaces that are requirements of universal wholeness implicit in the cosmic order. It is called System 2.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} riboflavin-ultraviolet-A-induced cross-linking (CXL) following corneal alkali burns in rabbits. Methods: The right corneas and <b>limbi</b> of ten rabbits were burned using a 1 N solution of NaOH and the animals were then divided into two groups: a control group submitted to clinical treatment alone and an experimental group that was treated 1 h after injury with CXL, followed by the same clinical treatment as administered to the controls. Clinical parameters were evaluated post-injury at 1, 7, 15, and 30 days by two independent observers. Following this evaluation, the corneas were excised and examined histologically. Results: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in clinical parameters, such as hyperemia, corneal edema, ciliary injection, limbal ischemia, secretion, corneal neovascularization, symblepharon, or blepharospasm, at any of the time-points evaluated. However, the size of the epithelial defect was significantly smaller in the CXL group (p< 0. 05) (day 15 : p= 0. 008 and day 30 : p= 0. 008) and the extent of the corneal injury (opacity lesion) was also smaller (day 30 : p= 0. 021). Histopathology showed the presence of collagen bridges linking the collagen fibers in only the CXL group.

40|$|Objective: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) accelerates brain aging and cognitive decline. Complex interactions between hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and brain aging remain unresolved. This {{study investigated the}} relationship between glycemic variability at multiple time scales, brain volumes and cognition in type 2 DM. Research Design and Methods: Forty-three older adults with and 26 without type 2 DM completed 72 -hour continuous glucose monitoring, cognitive tests and anatomical MRI. We described a new analysis of continuous glucose monitoring, termed Multi-Scale glycemic variability (Multi-Scale GV), to examine glycemic variability at multiple time scales. Specifically, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to identify five unique ultradian glycemic variability cycles (GVC 1 – 5) that modulate serum glucose with periods ranging from 0. 5 – 12 hrs. Results: Type 2 DM subjects demonstrated greater variability in GVC 3 – 5 (period 2. 0 – 12 hrs) than controls (P, 0. 0001), during the day as well as during the night. Multi-Scale GV was related to conventional markers of glycemic variability (e. g. standard deviation and mean glycemic excursions), but demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity to conventional markers, and was associated with worse long-term glycemic control (e. g. fasting glucose and HbA 1 c).

40|$|AIMS—This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to confirm the}} distribution and expression of the molecule CD 44 on human corneas under normal and pathological conditions.  METHODS—Fifty eight corneal buttons from adult patients suffering from various corneal diseases and four normal corneas were included in this study. Frozen sections were stained immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies against human CD 44 using an APAAP method and observed under a light microscope.  RESULTS—In normal corneas CD 44 was predominantly expressed on the membranes of basal epithelial cells and on the keratocytes, {{as well as on}} the vascular endothelial cells of the corneal <b>limbi,</b> but was not expressed on corneal endothelial cells. Enhanced expression of CD 44 was observed on the epithelium of corneas with inflammation and allograft rejection. In a number of abnormal conditions including allograft rejection, corneal trauma, primary and secondary corneal endothelial decompensation the remaining endothelial cells stained positively for CD 44. However, in some corneas of keratitis, keratoconus, and dystrophy the endothelium which appeared relatively integral in morphology and amount remained CD 44 negative.  CONCLUSIONS—These results suggest that CD 44, the hyaluronate receptor, may play an important role in corneal cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Its regulation is closely related to corneal inflammatory reactions. The induction of CD 44 on corneal endothelium might play a potential role in compensatory processes when corneal endothelial cells are injured. ...|$|R
