25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy {{approached}} Beverly Hills Cop writer Daniel Petrie, Jr. {{to write}} the screenplay when a concept that executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg described as [...] "either the best or worst idea in the world" [...] arose—Star Trek fan Eddie Murphy wanted a starring role.
