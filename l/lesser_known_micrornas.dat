30|$|Since many microRNA {{families}} are evolutionarily conserved across many lineages {{in the plant}} kingdom {{and the fact that}} lots of microRNAs in different plant species shared the same mature sequence in miRBase 19.0 ([URL] microRNA genes in one species may have orthologs or homologs existed in other species. Given that, we enlarged the annotation scale to an expansion of multiple species of <b>known</b> and novel <b>microRNAs.</b> For the identified microRNAs, the measurement of its evolutionary conservation was performed by similarity search against the currently <b>known</b> <b>microRNAs</b> in miRBase 19.0 in other plant species (Fig.  1). If a read matched one or more <b>known</b> <b>microRNAs</b> with > 95 % identity, it was regarded as homologous in evolution. Through the evolutionary conservation profile, the lineage-specific and species-specific microRNAs can be identified and visualized easily.|$|R
