5|$|While {{serving in}} Southern Africa, Baden-Powell <b>learnt</b> many {{the skills that}} would become {{standard}} scouting skills. Jan Grootboom, a Xhosa from South Africa, was a military scout who Baden-Powell praised for his scouting ability in the Matabele Campaign. Baden-Powell also <b>learnt</b> scouting skills from Frederick Russell Burnham, an American explorer, adventurer, and mercenary, {{who went on to}} become a highly decorated Major and Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts during the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|At the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College, Giridhar <b>learnt</b> {{the eight}} Ganas of Sanskrit prosody while {{studying}} Chandaprabhā, a work on Sanskrit prosody. The next day, he composed his first Sanskrit verse, in the Bhujaṅgaprayāta metre.|$|E
5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor <b>learnt</b> the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was <b>learnt</b> as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
5|$|Isabelle is {{preparing}} for her marriage with the Prince of Granada. Alice rushes in to inform her of what she has <b>learnt</b> about Robert, but she is interrupted by envoys of the Prince who enter bearing gifts. Robert arrives and, using {{the power of the}} branch, freezes everyone except himself and Isabelle.|$|E
5|$|Leander {{has been}} {{described}} as having a strange playing style by Andre Agassi. He varies his play as the match goes on; {{he is one of the}} best volleyers and a talented dropshotter. His volleying techniques were <b>learnt</b> from former Indian player Akhtar Ali.|$|E
5|$|Several Danes are {{remembered for}} their {{contributions}} to daguerreotypy. While in Paris in 1848, Anton Melbye (1818–1875), a marine artist, <b>learnt</b> from Daguerre. Rudolph Striegler, Johan Emilius Bogh and Johan Ludvig Ussing were among those who began to specialize in portrait photography opening studios in Copenhagen and the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be <b>learnt</b> from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic is left to be done, but the key lesson to be <b>learnt</b> is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic. Theory and Practice". In: Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg (eds.) Political Animals and Animal Politics. Basingstoke, United Kingdom: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 130–163.|$|E
5|$|Wenger is a Roman Catholic, and he {{attributes}} his outlook and values to his religious upbringing. He grew up speaking French and German, {{and has since}} <b>learnt</b> English, Italian, and Spanish. He also knows some Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Þorgerðr {{probably}} had the stone made {{as soon as}} she had <b>learnt</b> that Özurr, the last of her uncles, had died in Greece, and she likely did this to ensure her right of inheritance. The inscription on the reverse side of the stone, relating how her other uncles died, is in fornyrðislag.|$|E
5|$|After {{going through}} the script, JAR Pictures' Ajay G. Rai decided to produce the film, and insisted on Iyer to direct it as well. Although {{initially}} reluctant, Iyer agreed to direct and <b>learnt</b> the major aspects of cinematography {{as a part of}} her preparation. Gavemic U Ary worked as the cinematographer for the film, and Kunal Sharma headed the sound department. The visual effects were provided by Prasad Film Labs, a motion picture post-production studio based in Hyderabad, and the costumes were designed by Sachin Lovalekar.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara is {{referred}} to by the Greek author Stobaeus (c. 500 AD) while quoting Bardasanes (c. 154–222 AD), who <b>learnt</b> from an Indian embassy's visit to Syria {{during the reign of}} Elagabalus (Antoninus of Emesa) (218–22 AD). A terracotta androgynous bust, excavated at Taxila and dated to the Saka-Parthian era, pictures a bearded man with female breasts.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus <b>learnt</b> that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} had hit another period of {{financial}} trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot. After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also <b>learnt</b> how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|Charles Elmé Francatelli, from an Italian family, {{was born}} in London in 1805, and <b>learnt</b> cookery in France. Coming to England, he worked for various aristocrats before {{becoming}} chief chef of Crockford's club and then chief cook to Queen Victoria in 1840. He went on to work at Crockford's again, at the Coventry House and Reform Clubs, St James's Hotel, and for the Prince and Princess of Wales. This made him a celebrity cook of his time.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not <b>learnt</b> before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting {{to be able to talk}} to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before American officials <b>learnt</b> of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E
5|$|Fleming also {{travelled}} to Los Angeles with Cuneo, {{visiting the}} Los Angeles Police Intelligence headquarters, where they met Captain James Hamilton, who provided Fleming {{with information on}} the Mafia organisation in the US. From Los Angeles Fleming travelled to Las Vegas, where he stayed at the Sands Hotel; he interviewed the hotel owner, Jack Entratter, where he <b>learnt</b> the background to the security systems and methods of cheating that he used in the novel.|$|E
5|$|From 1925 {{until early}} 1928, the Bells lived in Britain while John {{attended}} RAF Staff College, Andover and acted as RAAF liaison officer to the Royal Air Force. Interested in aviation since her teens, Mary <b>learnt</b> {{to fly in}} England and in April 1927 qualified for a Grade'A' private pilot's licence. Returning to Australia, {{she was the first}} female to gain a pilot's licence in Victoria, on 20March 1928. The following year, she became the first Australian woman to qualify as a ground engineer.|$|E
5|$|Gan was of Hokkien Chinese descent, {{born and}} educated in Melaka, and {{the eldest son}} of five in his family. His forefathers emigrated from Fujian, China, to Malaya. Owing to poor circumstances, he had an {{elementary}} school education in which he <b>learnt</b> {{to read and write}} in simple English and keep accounts. After his father's death, Gan, then 16 years old, was involved in the nutmeg business on a very small scale.|$|E
5|$|I thus <b>learnt</b> {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, {{when he heard a}} baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he <b>learnt</b> during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 {{while at}} Boston University, Massaquoi {{completed}} editing the autobiography (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: The Autobiography of a Vai Noblewoman). Thanks to her extensive travels and education, by this time, she spoke several languages—at least eight and four tribal dialects. In {{addition to her}} native Vai and Mende, she spoke English which she had first <b>learnt</b> at school in Liberia, German from her many years in Hamburg, and French from her schooling in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In January 1605, Charles {{was created}} Duke of York, as is {{customary}} {{in the case}} of the English sovereign's second son, and made a Knight of the Bath. Thomas Murray, a Presbyterian Scot, was appointed as a tutor. Charles <b>learnt</b> the usual subjects of classics, languages, mathematics and religion. In 1611, he was made a Knight of the Garter.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc <b>learnt</b> a {{great deal}} about how to handle and supply a force {{advancing}} across the desert, and was rewarded with the British Distinguished Service Order. He began planning a far more ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to Général de brigade in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his kepi.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a good sense of position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he <b>learnt</b> from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E
5|$|The Trust {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to allow visitors to the house while work was underway, especially {{taking into account the}} costs of Health and Safety requirements and the delays these could cause to the essential preservation works. But the need for cash dictated the answer, and the Trust <b>learnt</b> that, through giving the public close access to the preservation works, they actually gave more additional donations as a result of seeing where their money was going and how they were making a difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably <b>learnt</b> from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there is a contradiction.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{made its}} first {{landfall}} at Cozumel, and Cortés remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. At Cozumel, Cortés heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucatán mainland, who he presumed were Europeans. Cortés sent out messengers to them {{and was able to}} rescue the shipwrecked Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had <b>learnt</b> the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés' interpreter.|$|E
5|$|The support ship {{eventually}} {{arrived from}} Santo Domingo, and Montejo {{used it to}} sail south along the coast, while he sent D'Avila over land. Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal (modern Chetumal). At Chaktumal, Montejo <b>learnt</b> that shipwrecked Spanish sailor Gonzalo de Guerrero was in the region, and Montejo sent messages to him, inviting {{him to return to}} join his compatriots, but the Mayanised Guerrero declined.|$|E
5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as much a matter of personal spite as of racism – Wagner had <b>learnt</b> a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|The {{western world}} <b>learnt</b> of Tiruvannamalai during the mid 20th century, {{through the work}} of Ramana Maharishi (1879–1950 CE). The cave where Ramana meditated is on the lower slopes of the Annamalai hills, with the ashram further down at the foothills. The {{basement}} of the raised hall inside the temple has the Patala Lingam, where Ramana attained supreme awareness while ants devoured his flesh. The place is also called a Mukthi Sthalam, meaning place of salvation, and saints like Seshadri Swamigal, Gugai Namachivayar and Yogi Ramsuratkumar {{have been associated with}} the temple.|$|E
5|$|Wong Nai Siong, a Christian scholar from Gutian County, Fujian {{province}} of China, <b>learnt</b> about Sarawak and the White Rajahs through his son-in-law, Dr Lim Boon Keng. Disillusioned with the Qing Dynasty's heavy handed approach against the Boxer Rebellion where Chinese Christians were specially targeted for murder, Wong Nai Siong decided {{to search for}} a new settlement overseas, focusing on areas in South East Asia. Previously, in September 1899, he had searched fruitlessly in Malaya and Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had <b>learnt</b> his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E
5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he <b>learnt</b> the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E
5|$|Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle {{grew up in}} {{the eastern}} Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma <b>learnt</b> to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later {{relocated}} to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training {{three or four times a}} week, and his father drove him to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they <b>learnt</b> that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
