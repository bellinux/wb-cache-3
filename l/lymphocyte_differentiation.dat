25|$|IgE, the IgE {{synthesis}} pathway, and the IgE-mediated allergic/inflammatory pathway are {{all important}} targets in intervening with the pathological processes of allergy, asthma, and other IgE-mediated diseases. The B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> and maturation pathway that eventually generate IgE-secreting plasma cells {{go through the}} intermediate steps of IgE-expressing B lymphoblasts and involves the interaction with IgE-expressing memory B cells. Tanox, a biotech company based in Houston, Texas, proposed in 1987 that by targeting membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B lymphoblast and memory B cells, those cells can be lysed or down-regulated, thus achieving the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific IgE and hence a shift of immune balance toward non-IgE mechanisms. Two approaches targeting the IgE pathway were evolved and both are in active development. In the first approach, the anti-IgE antibody drug omalizumab (trade name Xolair) recognises IgE not bound to its receptors and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to the receptors on mast cells and basophils. Xolair has been approved in many countries for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma. It has also been approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U. S. for treating chronic spontaneous urticaria, which cannot be adequately treated with H1-antihistamines. In the second approach, antibodies specific for a domain of 52 amino acid residues, referred to as CεmX or M1’ (M1 prime), present only on human mIgE on B cells and not on free, soluble IgE, have been prepared and are under clinical development {{for the treatment of}} allergy and asthma.

40|$|SummaryMemory CD 8 + T cells induced upon {{immunization}} exhibit improved functional {{features that}} contribute to protection of immunized hosts. Although both cognate antigen recognition and inflammation are important for memory CD 8 + T cell reactivation, the relative contribution of these factors and the cell types providing these signals in vivo are poorly defined. Here, we show that Ly 6 C+CCR 2 + inflammatory monocytes, a subset of monocytes, largely orchestrate memory CD 8 + T and NK lymphocytes activation by differentiating into interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) - and IL- 15 -producing cells in an inflammasome and type I interferon-IRF 3 -dependent manner. Memory CD 8 + T cells became potent effector cells by sensing inflammation from monocytes independently of their cognate antigen. Like NK cells, they underwent rapid mobilization, upregulated intense and sustained effector functions during bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, and contributed to innate responses and protection in vivo. Thus, inflammatory monocyte-derived IL- 18 and IL- 15 are critical to initiate memory CD 8 + T and NK <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>differentiation</b> into antimicrobial effector cells...|$|R

The role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), T-box expressed in T-cells (T-bet), and eomesodermin (EOMES) in mediating T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>differentiation</b> in response to Aspergillus fumigatus infection in immunocompromised rats was investigated in this study. Methods: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) of immunosuppressive twenty male rats were established and sacrificed at 24 h (n = 5), 48 h (n = 5), 72 h (n = 5), and 96 h (n = 5) after A. fumigatus infection. In addition, control (n = 5), cyclophosphamide (CTX) (n = 5), and aspergillosis (n = 5) group were also established the tissues and pathology of lung tissue was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. CD 8 + T-cells was sorted by flow cytometry. Serum mTOR, S 6 K, T-bet, and EOMES were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Histology of lung tissue indicated severe lung tissue injury including infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar wall damage or degradation, blood congestion, and hemorrhage in the CTX, IPA, and CTX + IPA rats. Hyphae were seen in the IPA, and CTX + IPA groups. The proportion of CD 8 + T-cells was significantly increased in the animals of CTX + IPA. Memory CD 8 + T-cells was significantly increased in early stage (24 h and 48 h, P < 0. 001), but decreased in the late phase of fungal infection (72 h and 96 h) in the animals of CTX + IPA. In addition, at early stage of fungal infection (24 h and 48 h), serum mTOR (P < 0. 001), S 6 K (P < 0. 001), and T-bet (P < 0. 05) was significantly higher, while EOMES was significantly lower (P < 0. 001), in CTX + IPA group than that in control, CTX alone or IPA alone group. Conversely, serum mTOR, S 6 K, T-bet, and EOMES showed opposite changed in the late stage (72 h and 96 h). Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that mTOR and S 6 K were significantly correlated with T-bet (r = 0. 901 and 0. 91, respectively, P < 0. 001), but negatively and significantly correlated with EOMES (r = − 0. 758 and − 0. 751, respectively, P < 0. 001).

In 1973, he was awarded a prestigious American Cancer Society Professor of Microbiology that provided substantial salary support. Also in 1973, {{he became one of}} the early faculty members in the newly organized MIT Center for Cancer capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase. The MIT CRC was led by Salvador E. Luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including Baltimore, Phillips Robbins, Herman Eisen, Philip Sharp, and Robert Weinberg, who all went on to illustrious research careers. Baltimore was honored as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. He returned to New York City in 1975, for a year-long sabbatical at Rockefeller University working with Jim Darnell. In 1975, at the age of 37, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The citation reads, [...] "for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell." [...] At the time, Baltimore's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase (Rtase or RT) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV and was discovered independently, and at about the same time, by Mizutani and Temin. Following this, his lab and intellectual interests expanded tackling new problems such as the pathogenesis of Abelson murine leukemia virus (AMuLV), <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> and related topic in immunology. In 1980, his group isolated the oncogene in AMuLV and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor. This type of enzymatic activity was also discovered by Tony Hunter, who has done extensive work in the area. He also continued to pursue fundamental questions in RNA viruses and in 1981, Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello, a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory, used recombinant DNA technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus, an animal RNA virus. The plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced. The infectious clone, DNA encoding the genome of a virus, is a standard tool used today in virology.|$|E

Whether iNKT cells also regulate γδT <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>differentiation</b> is unknown. We found that iNKT cells play a protective role in ReA. BALB/c Jα 18 −/− mice suffered a severe Salmonella enterocolitis, a 3. 5 -fold increase in IL- 17 expression and aggravated inflammation of the synovial membrane. On the other hand, activation of iNKT cells with α-GalCer abrogated IL- 17 response to Salmonella enterocolitis and prevented intestinal and joint tissue damage. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of α-GalCer was related to a drop in the proportion of IL- 17 -producing γδT lymphocytes (IL 17 -γδTcells) rather than to a decrease in Th 17 cells. In summary, we here show that iNKT cells play a protective role against Salmonella-enterocolitis and Salmonella-induced ReA by downregulating IL 17 -γδTcells...|$|R
40|$|Antigen {{recognition}} by clonotypic B cell receptor (BcR) {{is the first}} step of B <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>differentiation</b> into plasmocytes. This B cell function is dependent on efficient major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II–restricted presentation of BcR-bound antigens. In this work, we analyzed the subcellular mechanisms underlying antigen presentation after BcR engagement on B cells. In quiescent B cells, we found that MHC class II molecules mostly accumulated at the cell surface and in an intracellular pool of tubulovesicular structures, whereas H 2 -M molecules were mostly detected in distinct lysosomal compartments devoid of MHC class II. BcR stimulation induced the transient intracellular accumulation of MHC class II molecules in newly formed multivesicular bodies (MVBs), to which H 2 -M was recruited. The reversible downregulation of cathepsin S activity led to the transient accumulation of invariant chain–MHC class II complexes in MVBs. A few hours after BcR engagement, cathepsin S activity increased, the p 10 invariant chain disappeared, and MHC class II–peptide complexes arrived at the plasma membrane. Thus, BcR engagement induced the transient formation of antigen-processing compartments, enabling antigen-specific B cells to become effective antigenpresenting cells.

40|$|T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> is {{a complex}} {{developmental}} process involving the interaction of lymphoid cells with thymic stromal elements. Humoral factors are known to effect certain steps in intrathymic T cell differentiation (1). There is, however, little doubt that other developmental steps require direct cell contacts between differentiating thymocytes and thymic stroma cells. This is particularly true for selection processes, which are presumably involved in the generation of T lymphocyte specificity and diversity (2 - 5). The mechanism of intrathymic T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> is mostly unknown. We do not even know, where in the thymus these differentiation events take place. One possible site of thymocyte differentiation is a cell type, which we have recently discovered. 1 These cells are stromal elements of extraordinary size, which may contain 25 or more small- to medium-sized lymphoid thymocytes. The engulfed thymocytes are not degraded. In contrast, they appear to encounter microenvironmental conditions, which facilitate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. We have termed these specialized stroma cells "thymie nurse cells, " (TNC). 2 In this contribution, we present ultrastructural data, which identify TNC as epithelial cells. TNC contain lymphocytes, which appear to be fully intact and metabolically active, and display high mitotic activity. The lymphocytes are completely enclosed by intact TNC membranes. It appears that specialized contact areas exist that connect internalized lymphocytes with their surrounding TNC membranes.

This study uses an orthotopic model of {{malignant mesothelioma}} established in syngeneic, immunocompetent C 57 Bl/ 6 mice which produce malignant ascites and solid tumors that accurately replicate the histopathology of the human disease. Host stromal and immune cell accumulation within malignant ascites and solid tumors was determined using immunofluorescent labeling with confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

We next conducted in-vitro assays to characterize the functional properties of the MS gut microbiota. We found that MS-associated Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was sufficient to reduce Treg differentiation and increase both Th 1 and Th 2 differentiation. The expansion of Th 1 lymphocytes was recapitulated by Akkermansia muciniphila, which was also more abundant in MS patients. In contrast, Parabacteroidesdistasonis, which was significantly reduced in MS microbiomes, stimulated CD 4 + T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> into a CD 25 + IL- 10 + regulatory phenotype. Our results suggest that MS-associated changes in microbiota alter T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation</b> in a complex fashion and likely through multiple mechanisms. Finally, microbiota transplants from MS patients into germ-free mice results in more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced Tregs compared to controls. Conclusion: This study identifies specific human gut bacteria that regulate adaptive autoimmune responses, suggesting therapeutic targeting of the microbiota as a novel treatment for MS...|$|E

The logical formalism has been widely employed to study these interaction networks, which are modelled as discrete dynamical systems. While biologists identify networks encompassing more and more components, properties of biological relevance become hard to verify. Here, {{we report on the}} use of model-checking techniques to address this challenge. This approach is illustrated by an application dealing with the modelling of T-helper <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>differentiation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Upon {{recognition}} of a foreign antigen, CD 4 + naïve T lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate into subsets with distinct functions. This process is fundamental for the proper immune system function, as CD 4 + T cells orchestrate both the innate and adaptive immune response. Traditionally, this differentiation event has been regarded as the acquisition of an irreversible cell fate so that memory and effector CD 4 + T subsets were considered terminally differentiated cells or lineages. Consequently, these lineages are conventionally defined thanks to their prototypical set of cytokines and transcription factors. However, recent findings suggest that CD 4 + T lymphocytes possess a remarkable phenotypic plasticity, as they can often redirect their functional program depending on the milieu they encounter. Therefore new questions are now compelling such as which are the molecular determinants underlying plasticity and stability and how the balance between these two opposite forces drives the cell fate. As already mentioned, {{in some cases the}} mere expression of cytokines and master regulators could not fully explain lymphocytes plasticity. We should consider other layers of regulation, including epigenetic factors such as the modulation of chromatin state or the transcription of noncoding RNAs, whose high cell-specificity give a hint on their involvement in cell fate determination. In this review, we will focus on the recent advances in understanding CD 4 + T lymphocytes subsets specification from an epigenetic point of view. In particular, we will emphasize the emerging importance of noncoding RNAs as key players in these differentiation events. We will also present here new data from our laboratory highlighting the contribution of long noncoding RNAs in driving human CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>differentiation...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicroRNAs {{are small}} non-coding RNAs that {{regulate}} gene expression post-transcriptionally. Here we applied microRNA profiling in seventeen human lymphocyte subsets to identify microRNA signatures that were distinct among various subsets and {{different from those}} of mouse lymphocytes. miR- 125 b, one of the signature microRNAs of naïve CD 4 + T cells, regulated expression of genes involved in T-cell differentiation i. e., IFNG, IL 2 RB, IL 10 RA and PRDM 1. Expression of synthetic miR- 125 b RNA and lentiviral vectors encoding pre-miR- 125 b in naïve <b>lymphocytes</b> inhibited <b>differentiation</b> to effector cells. Our data provide an atlas of microRNA expression in human lymphocytes, define subset-specific signatures and their target genes, and indicate T-cell naïve state is enforced by microRNAs...|$|R
