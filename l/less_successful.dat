5|$|The City {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics, and proved <b>less</b> <b>successful</b> than The Hills.

The show has distributed all seasons to DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful.

5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing.

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} <b>less</b> <b>successful,</b> with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble {{stems from the}} need for a nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
