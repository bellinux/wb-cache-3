40|$|The {{ombudsman}} is an independent, nonpartisan {{third party}} who assists in grievance resolution. Ombudsmen {{have traditionally been}} found in government, but in the 1970 s they spread to formal organizations in higher education. health and business. During the 1980 s, the principal role of ombudsman. namely mediator, emerged; and apart from ombudsmanship, mediation appears to be playing a more prominent role in conflict resolution now that {{it did in the}} seventies. Mediators have become increasingly important in dealing with neighborhood disputes, and divorce mediation has taken the intimate concerns of the family out of the public arena, assigning responsibility to the disputants to work through their own problems. A few states have <b>laws</b> providing <b>for</b> <b>mediation</b> {{as an alternative to the}} court system, in child custody disputes, <b>for</b> example. As <b>mediation</b> becomes more widely accepted, professional associations are staking their claim to the role of mediator. The Family Mediation Association draws on members from a variety of disciplines. such as social work. The American Bar Association considers lawyers appropriate mediators in court related programs.

40|$|There {{are many}} aspects of {{mediation}} that support {{an analysis of the}} process as a feminist approach to dispute resolution. This analysis might be used in terms of justifying the increased use of mediation in family dispute contexts where the number of women disputants is high. Women who are victims of domestic violence, however, face many practical and process disadvantages in family law mediation, and whilst feminist scholarship has enabled {{a better understanding of the}} impact of domestic violence on a victim’s ability to participate effectively in mediation, the rates of participation remain high. This article considers some of the arguments <b>for</b> considering <b>mediation</b> as a feminist model of dispute resolution and contextualises those arguments in terms of their application to the participation of victims of domestic violence in mediation. The article argues that as victims of domestic violence increasingly find themselves in the mediation context, specific strategies are needed to protect their interests and ensure their safety. The article proposes a distinct model of family <b>law</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>for</b> matters where there is a history of domestic violence that centralises the role of a legal advocate for the victim...|$|R

Its operation is based on the following principles: voluntary, equality of the parties, neutrality of the mediator, exclusion of the public, efficiency of the procedure, confidentiality of information, fairness. In Macedonia the mediation as {{an alternative}} dispute resolution was introduced by the Law on Mediation in 2006. However, besides this law, the resolution of disputes by mediation is regulated by other special laws such as the Family Law Act, Consumer Law, the Juvenile Justice, <b>Law</b> <b>for</b> the peaceful resolution of labor disputes, etc [...] For effective functioning of the mediation, except legal regulation of mediation, and established appropriate institutional framework is an important link <b>for</b> a successful <b>mediation.</b> The institutional framework of mediation includes: Ministry of Justice - Sector <b>for</b> <b>Mediation,</b> Board <b>for</b> <b>Mediation,</b> the Mediators Chamber of Macedonia and mediator.

40|$|Virtually every {{practicing}} {{attorney and}} legal academic first encountered uniform statutes when studying the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in law school. Yet the UCC 2 ̆ 7 s widespread acceptance and periodic renewal {{are not the}} legacy of most uniform law ventures. Taking a harder look at the uniform statutory process and its products may allow participants in a new effort to set realistic goals, or at least assist them in anticipating problems {{they are likely to}} face. This Article offers an overview and some pointers regarding the distinct challenge of developing a successful uniform mediation law. It discusses problems that stem from the private nature of the uniform act drafting operation, and also from the diversity of political and legislative settings in which a uniform statutory solution is evaluated. The use of mediation now permeates multiple public and private settings, and the related body of mediation law has experienced vast growth. At the outset of a long-term project to develop a uniform mediation act, it would be premature if not foolhardy to prescribe a pathway for success. I do, however, start from a belief that the legislative process possesses a certain coherence and that aspects of the anticipated journey may be chartable at least in broad terms. In particular, the journey may be affected by understanding which rationales best support a uniform <b>law</b> approach <b>for</b> <b>mediation,</b> by raising questions as to how one measures the success of such an approach, and by becoming aware of major structural or procedural obstacles that may be encountered en route. The Article relates these broad considerations to the current regulatory landscape of mediation law in an effort to provide reference points <b>for</b> the uniform <b>mediation</b> project. Part I presents an overview of the uniform law enterprise, focusing on the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and on the Conference 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between uniform and model acts. Part II considers possible reasons for adopting a uniform statutory approach. It examines public-regarding purposes and also the self-interested vantage point of various participants before discussing how these perspectives might apply in the mediation context. Part II also identifies different approaches to measuring and defining the success of a uniform law project, and suggests that a broader understanding of what constitutes success may be helpful. Finally, Part III raises several problems that are likely to confront any effort to promulgate a uniform law and indicates how these problems may arise in the mediation law setting...|$|R
