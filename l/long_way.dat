5|$|The <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round team reunited in 2007 {{for another}} {{motorcycle}} trip from John o' Groats in Scotland to Cape Town in South Africa. The journey, entitled <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down, lasted from 12 May until 5 August 2007. McGregor's brother Colin joined the motorcycle team {{during the early}} stages of the <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down journey, and his father Jim also rode on sections of both <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round and <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down.|$|E
5|$|McGregor is {{involved}} in charity work, including UNICEF UK since 2004 and GO Campaign. During the <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions saw some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during the <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did some work for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for the GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He {{has worked with the}} Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down. In 2012, he travelled with UNICEF immunization workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission.|$|E

5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from the seafront attractions, which {{were at the}} foot of a steep hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's tourist industry depended were therefore increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next to the beach.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has come a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Furman {{sent the}} spy Moe Berg to Switzerland {{to meet the}} head of the German project, Werner Heisenberg. After chatting with Heisenberg at a {{cocktail}} party, Berg concluded that the Germans were a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> behind the Allied effort. Furman travelled to Rome in June 1944, where he interviewed Italian scientists about the German project.|$|E

5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} fire-fighting {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a <b>long</b> <b>way,</b> tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.|$|E
5|$|A {{motorcyclist}} {{since his}} youth, McGregor undertook a marathon international motorbike trip {{with his best}} friend Charley Boorman and cameraman Claudio von Planta in 2004. From mid-April {{to the end of}} July, they travelled from London to New York via central Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia, Canada and the United States on BMW R1150GS Adventure motorbikes, for a cumulative distance of 22,345 miles (35,960km). The trip included visits to several UNICEF programs along the route, and formed the basis of a television series and a best-selling book, both called <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{subsequent}} to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided {{in an attempt to}} prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell five runs short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by Patsy Hendren and Harold Larwood.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took the <b>long</b> <b>way</b> back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments and Requirements. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences {{in the amount of}} time spent while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the <b>long</b> <b>way</b> round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because he thought he could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|Tanahashi next tried a Rainmaker, which Okada {{countered with}} one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging straitjacket German suplex, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking the fans and performing his air guitar routine.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{text on the}} Rosetta Stone {{provided}} the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, {{but they were not}} familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E
