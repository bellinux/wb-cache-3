The drive is built up around an outer loop of speed equipped with an incremental encoder and two inner loops of torque and flux implemented in a direct torque control (DTC) scheme. The scheme {{takes advantage of the}} available speed to estimate the motor torque and the stator flux magnitude by means of the IM current model. This allows the full exploitation of the drive capabilities even in the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> Furthermore, with a suitable representation of the IM current model, the drive can be operated down up to zero speed.

In {{this paper}} a novel sensorless speed control scheme of Induction Motor (IM) {{by means of}} Direct Torque Fuzzy Control (DTFC), PI-type fuzzy speed {{regulator}} and fuzzy based Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS) speed estimator strategies has been proposed, {{which seems to be}} a boom in sensorless speed control schemes of AC drives.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the saliency-based self-sensing control of {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) and a novel machine configuration is proposed to improve the self-sensing performances. In recent time, PMSM drives have been steadily gaining popularity and have widespread applications in industry due to its benefits such as high power density, good dynamic performance and high efficiency. Self-sensing drives are superior to conventional drives in applications where the reliability and the cost are of important factors. Machine saliency is utilized for rotor position tracking during the start-up and the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> operation when Back-EMF components are not detectable. For conventional PMSM machines, however, the saliency of Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) machine is heavily affected by saturation effects under loaded operation; for the case of Surface Mounted Permanent Magnet (SMPM) machines, the saliency is not apparent and hard to detect. Hence the rotor position signals are relatively small or even undetectable at specific operation points, {{and these are the}} main challenges of PMSM drive self-sensing controlled at the <b>low</b> <b>speed.</b> Addition of a novel saliency modulation rotor end (SMRE) structure {{to the end of a}} conventional PMSM rotor to improve the self-sensing capability is proposed. The SMRE provides an additional space anisotropic to the rotor. The saliency modulation of the rotor end is electrically asynchronous with the machine`s rotating reference frame. Therefore, the machine saliency provided by SMRE is not affected by saturation effects under loaded operation when high frequency injection scheme is adopted in <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ranges.</b> In addition, for the medium and high <b>speed</b> <b>range,</b> the rotor position can be tracked without superposed injection as the saliency modulation can be achieved by taking the fundamental voltage as the carrier signal. A genetic algorithms (GA) optimization environment combined with the finite element analysis (FEA) enables to obtain optimized rotor end geometry for the maximum modulation signal and minimum total harmonic distortions (THD). The expected self-sensing performance is validated by a prototype machine and is compared with conventional PMSMs in experimental tests...|$|R

40|$|Wind is {{a natural}} source of energy related to the low and medium speed range. Electricity can be {{generated}} from the wind by using a variable speed machine. Among the common types of machines available are: double fed induction generator (DFIG), induction generator and also synchronous generator. However, the latest addition to the group is the Switched Reluctance Generator (SRG), which has attractive features such as simple in construction, inexpensive, robust and reliable. Current research on the SRG has been focusing on optimizing its performance individually in terms of structure, control and also reducing the components of power electronic devices. Despite the extensive research on the individual component of the machine, the comprehensive performance of the SRG {{has not yet been}} published. The main contribution of this thesis is the proposed modelling framework of the SRG. Based on the framework, extensive and in depth comparative analysis can be conducted. Firstly, the design of the existing machine including the winding configuration and rotor structure using finite element method is investigated. Secondly, based on the principle of electromagnetism, a simulation framework that adopts a heuristic method to perform comparative analysis between different types of SRG has been proposed. This framework serves as a platform {{to the development of the}} SRG in the low and medium speed operation. It can be used to predict the performance of the machine before it can be implemented on a prototype, thus, saving time and costs. Thirdly, the procedure to determine the optimal control variables is proposed. Basically, the controller plays an important role to determine the placement of the firing angles along the inductance profile. The most influential parameter that affects the percentage of power generated which are the firing angles and voltage level has been identified. A polynomial function relating the percentage of power generated in terms of the optimal control variables has also been developed. Lastly, a novel control method is proposed to operate the machine in single pulse mode as opposed to the current chopping mode during the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> The proposed control scheme provides the highest percentage of power generated during the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> Overall, the research will aid in the development of the SRG by allowing user to choose the best generating operation within any speed range...|$|E

The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with floating ring seal. When the thickness of bump floating ring seals is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump floating ring seal with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the floating ring seal or small thickness of bump foil.
