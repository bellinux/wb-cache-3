5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
5|$|Megalosaurus {{may have}} been the first dinosaur, apart from modern birds, to be {{described}} in the scientific literature. Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield limestone quarry, Oxfordshire in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description and illustration in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1676. It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published. Plot correctly identified the bone as the <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England. He therefore at first concluded it to be the thighbone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human, such as those mentioned in the Bible. The bone has since been lost, but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of Megalosaurus.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Almost 50 % of all skiing {{accidents}} {{in men and}} more then 70 % of all skiing {{accidents in}} women concerned the <b>lower</b> <b>extremities.</b> In snowboarding {{about a third of}} all accidents concerned the <b>lower</b> <b>extremities</b> in both men and women (Burtscher et al., 2003).

25|$|The {{extensor}} pollicis longus (EPL) originates on the {{dorsal side}} of the ulna and the interosseous membrane.

25|$|Chronic venous stasis {{changes can}} mimic early lymphedema, but {{the changes in}} venous stasis are more often {{bilateral}} and symmetric. Lipedema can also mimic lymphedema, however lipedema characteristically spares the feet beginning abruptly at the medial malleoli (ankle level). Lipedema is common in overweight women. As {{a part of the}} initial work-up before diagnosing lymphedema, {{it may be necessary to}} exclude other potential causes of <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> swelling such as renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, congestive heart-failure, protein-losing nephropathy, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, pregnancy and drug-induced edema.|$|E
25|$|There did {{not appear}} {{on the part of}} Napoleon any eagerness to resume the {{movement}} of the Imperial Guard towards the <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> of Ligny, but rather an anxiety to await calmly the most favourable moment for his projected attack. Doubtless he had discovered the march of the remaining battalions of Colonel Langbn's Brigade, from Sombreffe towards Saint-Amand, as a further reinforcement to the Prussian right, and calculated upon paralysing the attack which Blücher was evidently preparing against the French left flank, by executing a sudden and vigorous assault on the Prussian centre, with a preponderating mass of fresh troops.|$|E

After analyzing the data,the findings showed that (1) the traditional resistance significantly increased strength of <b>lower</b> <b>extremities</b> on both absolute and relative peak torque and power, (2) the conventional training combined with vibration training can significantly increase the peak torque of extensors in <b>lower</b> <b>extremities,</b> and (3) the authors believed that the vibration training may be a better training method to improve the strength or power in <b>lower</b> <b>extremities.</b> However, the mechanism should be further investigated. 1...|$|R

25|$|Moderate {{exercise}} is beneficial {{with respect to}} pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. These exercises should occur {{at least three times}} per week. While some evidence supports certain physical therapies, evidence for a combined program is limited. There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy. The evidence for manual therapy is inconclusive. Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> arthritis as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{experienced in}} cholesterol embolism depend {{largely on the}} organ involved. Non-specific symptoms often described are fever, muscle ache and weight loss. Embolism to the legs causes a mottled appearance and purple discoloration of the toes, small infarcts and areas of gangrene due to tissue death that usually appear black, and areas of the skin that assume a marbled pattern known as livedo reticularis. The pain is usually severe and requires opiates. If the ulcerated plaque is below the renal arteries the manifestations appear in both lower extremities.

25|$|This {{classification}} {{is used in}} para-Alpine and para-Nordic standing skiing, where LW {{stands for}} Locomotor Winter. Skiers in this class have a disability in one <b>lower</b> <b>extremity,</b> which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee arthrodesis or a hip arthrodesis. If there are functional problems on the leg, the strength of the leg will be 30 or less, where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40. Lower limb monoplegia is a type disability that is comparable to knee amputation for this class. Skiers may be in this class {{as a result of an}} amputation, or polio.|$|E
25|$|William Albert Bruce Cooper {{was born}} on 22 November 1914 in Castle Eden, County Durham, England.

In 1930, the teenager obtained work on a tramp steamer by prevaricating about his age. Cooper graduated with a medical degree from Durham University in 1938. Before the Second World War, he was a general practitioner in County Durham. There, he not infrequently had to treat the victims of coalmining accidents.

[...] The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is [...] wide. Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity, have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone's length. Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano, and is additionally the site of a number of large pit craters; its <b>lower</b> <b>extremity</b> reaches down Kīlauea's submerged flank to a depth of more than [...] By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974, and to date has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all.

Between 1978 and 1982, research was undertaken by Auburn University as to the effect of applications of chemical and physical irritants to the legs of Tennessee Walking Horses.
