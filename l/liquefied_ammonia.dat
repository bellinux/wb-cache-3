40|$|Nowadays, water {{curtains}} {{are often}} employed in industry to contain flammable or toxic clouds due to accidental releases of process fluids (Deaves, 1983; St-Georges et al., 1992). The action of water curtains consists, essentially, in diluting vapour clouds down to safety level from both toxic effect threshold and lower flammability limit (Mc Quaid et al., 1983). The extent of dilution {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the mechanism involved: dispersion enhancement, owing to the air entrainment and the mixing of entrained air with the vapour released; physical absorption of the released gas, eventually joined to chemical reaction; heating of gas clouds (if gas behaving like heavy ones, due to low temperature, are concerned, e. g. cryogenically <b>liquefied</b> LNG or <b>ammonia</b> gas). Recently it has been observed that the effect of mitigation could be increased by the use of a chemical solution giving a non-reversible reaction with the released substance (Griolet et al., 1995). This research programme aims to design and realize the experimental equipment allowing experimenta 1 simulation of water spray curtain interaction with gas plume; to carry out a complete fluidynamic analysis; to evaluate the effect of physical absorption; to evaluate the effect of combined chemical and physical absorption and, finally, to develop a theoretical model, validated by experimental results and useful in scale-up operation...|$|R

50|$|In 1805, American {{inventor}} Oliver Evans {{described a}} closed vapor-compression refrigeration cycle {{for the production}} of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist Michael Faraday <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, Jacob Perkins, built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously. A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, John Gorrie, who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer Alexander Twining took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.|$|E
5000|$|In 1820, English {{scientist}} and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{was allowed to}} evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie {{did not get the}} money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the [...] "Ice King", Frederic Tudor, for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.|$|E
30|$|Transfer {{of ammonia}} to tank B can be {{accomplished}} by various methods; however, the best option when using the present system will be to feed compressed and <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> from the multistage compressor. In this method, because of the ammonia gas in the filled tank, the ammonia concentration in the empty tank is brought to 100  %, and then, some part of vaporized ammonia in the filled tank is compressed by the compressor; thus, <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> is sent by the compressor discharge line to the filled tank. Exergy analysis performed for this method reveals that exergy losses for the present system result from losses in the ammonia tank and ammonia pumps.|$|E
30|$|The {{preparation}} and chemical analysis of untreated or ammonia-treated birch wood meal were previously reported [10]. In brief, a birch wood block was milled, and then sieved to obtain 40 -mesh-passed meal. The wood meal was Soxhlet extracted with benzene–ethanol (2 : 1 v/v) {{and used for}} experiments as untreated biomass (UB). UB was treated with <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> at 140  °C for 1  h and used for experiments as ammonia-treated biomass (AB).|$|E
30|$|Another {{purpose of}} the {{operation}} {{is to ensure that}} the entire amount of ammonia is used to exert pressure on the nitrogen gas, for purging nitrogen in tank B. The entire amount of ammonia gas in the available system is transferred from tank A to tank B. The vaporized part of liquid ammonia in tank A is sent to the multistage compressor for liquefaction, and this <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> is sent to tank A for storage. Most of the vaporized ammonia in tank A flows to tank B because of the concentration gradient and the difference between B and C.|$|E
30|$|Tank A {{is filled}} with liquid ammonia, and tank B {{is filled with}} {{nitrogen}} gas. The purpose of this arrangement is to purge nitrogen gas in tank B, in preparation for filling with liquid ammonia. Because of the ambient temperature, the liquid ammonia in tank A (1  atm, − 33  °C) may vaporize and reach the compressor suction by pipeline 1. The <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> is repeatedly directed to tank A from the compressor discharge via pipelines 2 – 5. The conditioning work involving prefilling tank B with liquid ammonia, by using pipeline 1, was accomplished by the vaporized ammonia in tank A.|$|E
30|$|Various {{pretreatment}} {{methods are}} used to enhance the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass [2]. Among them, {{one of the most}} promising approaches for lignocellulosic biomass from grass plants is pretreatment with <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia,</b> and this methodology has been extensively investigated [3 – 5]. The ammonia cleaves ester bonds in lignocellulosic biomass and generates amides [6, 7]. It has been demonstrated that ammonia pretreatment also alters the polymorphic form of crystalline cellulose with a low water content, transforming the natural crystalline form (cellulose I) to cellulose IIII [8], which is far more susceptible to enzymatic degradation [9]. Moreover, we have recently reported that ammonia pretreatment is effective for improving enzymatic saccharification of not only grass biomasses but also hardwood biomasses with high xylan and low lignin contents such as birch wood and willow wood [10]. Nevertheless, searching for effective enzymes for the conversion of ammonia-treated hardwood biomass is still under development.|$|E
40|$|A coupled hydrodynamic-chemical spill {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} the chemical spill in the San Diego Bay. The hydrodynamic model shows that the San Diego Bay is tidally dominated.

40|$|A compact, {{lightweight}} hydrogen-production {{system was}} developed for fuel-cell-based power supplies. Anhydrous ammonia is decomposed thermocatalytically in a microreactor to produce a fuel-cell feed gas. For an electrical energy capacity of 1250 W-h, this system has an energy density of 500 W-h/kg, which is roughly twice that of state-of-the-art batteries. Despite its energy-density advantage, this ammonia-based power supply will not likely be deployed in military or commercial markets unless safety concerns related to the possible rapid release of ammonia are resolved. Semi-permeable, high-void-fraction materials were developed {{to address the issue}} of ammonia safety. <b>Liquefied</b> <b>ammonia</b> is loaded into a monolithic block of safe-storage material, which is installed in a suitable lightweight tank. In the event of tank puncture or leakage from another system component, the release of toxic/flammable gas to the surroundings is restricted by the safe-storage material. Gas release from the safe-storage material is on the order of 1 g/min, which is sufficiently slow to avoid rapid formation of dangerous ammonia concentrations in an enclosed space. These safe-storage materials can also be used for storage of liquefied hydrocarbons such as propane and butane...|$|E
40|$|Japan {{produces}} less natural resoures, {{so it is}} {{the most}} important problem for Japan to develop a perennial natural energy. One of them, an electrical power generated by temperature difference of a ocean wather (EPTD) has been exploited for practical use. The EPTD is generated by expansion of <b>liquefied</b> <b>ammonia,</b> but electrical power produced by wather vapor (EPWV) is generated by thermal expansion of water vapor. Therefore, the EPTD system has an extra equipment for liquefaction of ammonia, comparing with the EPWV system, because an ammonia of b. p. - 33. 5 ℃ can not be liquefied by only cooling the ammonia gas which is vaporized from the liquid ammonia, using the bottom water (～ 4. 5 ℃) of deep ocean. The thermodynamics says that the thermal engine can not obtain 100 % efficiency with every efforts, because of the energy loss which is inevitable to the thermal engine. The thermodynamic calculation of the thermal energy which is necessary for obtaining some electrical energy shows that the ratio of the energy for the EPWV system to the energy of the EPTD is 1 : 17.

The thermodynamics says that a thermal engine can not obtain 100 % efficiency with every efforts, since a thermal engine needs the pseudo loss energy, which is, for example, the energy for resetting the piston to the top of cylinder, which is not changed to a work, but is indispensable to a thermal engine. Even the Carnot engine which is free from energy losses, the efficiency μ = (Q 1 -Q 2) / (Q 1 +Q 1 '+Q 2 +Q 2 ') is calculated to be 50 % at T 2 = O°K, due to the pseudo loss energy, Q 2 and Q 2 '. The thermodynamical calculation of the thermal energy which is necessary for obtaining some electrical energy shows that the ratio of the thermal energy for the EPWV system to that for the EPTD system for the same generation powerr is 1 : 2. It means that the EPTD system wastes more fossil fuels than the utilized perennial natural energy. The water cell, whose electrodes of Cu and Zn are immersed in water shows the same potentials as that of Voltaic cell.
