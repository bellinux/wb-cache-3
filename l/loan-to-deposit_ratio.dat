However, some countries in CEE {{appeared to have been}} more prepared and resilient than others. To draw some lessons on why some countries weathered the negative spillovers of the global financial crisis better than others, we focus on the case of the Czech economy, and subsequently bring in some cross-country evidence from the new EU member states. The derived lessons indicate that it is effective to establish a consolidated supervisor at the national level, ideally within a strong and independent central bank. That, consolidation of financial regulation and supervision facilitates a fast-action response, comprehensive data collection and analysis, and increases respect for the supervisor in the financial community. The lessons further stress the role of macro-prudential supervision ensuring, among others, moderate <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratios</b> of the banking sector and low dollarization of loans through adequate pricing of foreign exchange risk by banks. Further, a prudent macroeconomic management appears to deliver low interest rate differentials and thus a lower share of reversible capital. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we empirically examine the {{diversification}} {{effects of the}} deregulation of bank-sales channel into the insurance business by Japanese banks. Using the Japanese unique data set on fee-based revenues, we identify separate fee-based revenues, such as insurance and/or mutual fund sales. We find that banks with a higher BIS ratio, more branches, more monopolistic power in loan market, and higher <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratios</b> tend to have shifted towards an insurance fee-based business. This indicates that bank health and branch expansion can affect the fee business strategy at each bank. We also find that banks with lower mutual fund fee revenues tend to earn more insurance fee revenues, implying that a substitute relationship has developed between them after the Global Financial Crisis of 2007. We find that banks with higher insurance revenues are positively associated with return volatilities (such as ROA and/or ROE) but are not related with total risk or Z score. The results indicate that although increased fee-based activities can increase the volatility of bank earnings, they have only had a small impact on equity and/or insolvency risks at Japanese banks...|$|R

40|$|Upsurge in {{bank failure}} cases under {{a more stable}} {{currency}} environment raised the need to deeply investigate sources of bank failures in Zimbabwe. This is considered an imperative move considering the impact that bank failures pose to stakeholders outside the banking sector such as investors and depositors, the Zimbabwean banking sector itself {{as well as the}} entire economy. This study investigated the determinants of bank failures in Zimbabwe under the multiple currency environment. The study employed pooled logit estimator using general to specific logit estimation procedure on fourteen banks by making use of the financial panel data for the period 2009 - 2012. Empirical findings indicated that the macroeconomic environment, in particular GDP growth rate, has much influence on bank failure than any of bank fundamentals. Among bank fundamentals, liquidity, profitability and capitalisation proved to be prominent bank related determinants of bank failures in their respective order. Findings also suggest that <b>loan-to-deposits</b> <b>ratio</b> (LTD), deposits-to-assets ratio (DTA), gross revenue ratio (GRR), return on assets(ROA), efficiency ratio(EFR), SIZE and GDP growth rate (GDP) variables are negatively correlated to the possibility of banks failing while loan-to-assets (LTA) have positive influence on bank failures. Based on these findings the researcher recommends that RBZ must accentuate liquidity and capital requirements since both liquidity and capital ratios were significant and had higher marginal effects. Undoubtedly, the researcher recommends banks to curtail their operating expenses and also improve managerial efficiency so as promote and maintain bank safety and soundness and this will result in remarkable improvements in both profitability and efficienc...|$|R
40|$|Funding {{structures}} {{matter for}} financial stability. In particular, overreliance by some banks on {{certain types of}} wholesale funding—especially by U. S. and European banks—contributed to the global financial crisis. Most banks have recently made their funding structures more resilient by raising their capital adequacy ratios and reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale funding. However, some distressed banks remain vulnerable because their equity capital levels are inadequate and they are highly dependent on central bank funds. This chapter examines how bank funding structures have changed over time—especially {{in the run-up to}} the crisis—and how these structures affect financial stability. The analysis considers banks in a number of advanced and emerging market economies and includes systemically important banks. The analysis shows that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt (especially short-term debt) and have more diversified funding structures with lower <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratios.</b> Adequate capital buffers reduce a bank’s probability of default and support financial stability. Therefore, Basel III capital regulations that aim to raise the quantity and quality of capital should con-tinue to be a mainstay of the reform efforts. Basel III liquidity regulations will also play a role by reducing banks’ overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, which has proven detrimental to financial stability. Current reform efforts are aimed at reducing financial instability, but there can be tension among some key regulatory reforms that affect bank funding structures. As this chapter shows, such tension can arise, on the one hand, from pressures to use more secured funding (thereby raising levels of asset encumbrance) as well as deposits and, on the other hand, from bank-resolution initiatives (including the introduction of bail-in powers and th...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} the agency theory, but more {{specifically}} {{on the effect of}} employee ownership in banking. The agency theory states that top management is less willing to take large risks if they own stock in the company. My thesis looks at banks that employ Employee Stock Ownership Programs (ESOPs) and compares them with banks without ESOPs. In my thesis, I measure the amount of risk that banks take with 2 specific financial ratios. The equity ratio measures the amount of risk taken with respect to the bank's capital. The <b>Loan-to-Deposit</b> <b>ratio</b> measures risk with respect to loans as a percentage of deposits. My thesis also included statistical tests to find the confidence interval of the results and the correlation between the 2 risk measures. I found that there is a high correlation between the two measures in ESOP banks.

40|$|Employing {{a linear}} least square model and time series data from 1980 to 2009, this paper studies the {{determinants}} of Banking Sector liquidity in Nigeria and assesses {{the extent to which}} the recent financial crises affected liquidity in deposit money banks in the country. The paper makes some interesting findings. First, we find that only liquidity ratio, monetary policy rate and lagged <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratio</b> are significant for predicting Banking Sector liquidity. Secondly, we find that a decrease in monetary policy rates, liquidity ratios, volatility of output in relation to trend output, and the demand for cash, leads to an increase in current loan-to-deposit ratios; while a decrease in currency in circulation in proportion to Banking Sector deposits; and lagged loan-to-deposit ratios leads to a decline in current loan-to-deposit ratios. Our result suggests that during periods of economic or financial crises, deposit money banks are significantly illiquid relative to benchmarks, and getting liquidity monetary policies right during these periods is crucial in ensuring the survival of the Banking Sector. </p...|$|E
40|$|Product pricing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} decisions facing financial institution managers. Management has been forced to continuously review pricing with a "sharper pencil " in light of stiffer competition for a share of the market. If the institution is to be successful and ensure continued profitable existence, there must be a balance between loss control and pricing to generate profitability. This study looks specifically at the loan pricing dilemma from a risk management perspective that minimizes the number of calculations to arrive at the risk factor. THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND PRICING In the past, substantial lip service has been given to the impact of poor loan decisions upon a bank's profitability. This lip service obviously was not heeded in light of the substantial number of bank failures and declining bank earnings across the nation suffered during the 1980 s and 1990 s.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} a liquidity risk {{plays an important role}} in the current developed financial system. Some Hungarian and Polish banks suffered liquidity problems, too. This paper therefore aims to describe development of liquid asset ratio and to find out determinants which affect their values in the Visegrad countries. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2011. Liquidity of Czech banks declined in 2000 – 2009 (due to higher lending activity and decrease of balances with central banks and other banks) but it has improved during last two years. Liquidity of Slovak banks has decreased in 2009 and 2010 due to impact of {{financial crisis}} on some economic sectors and due to changes in interbank market transactions. Very similar is the development of liquid asset ratio in Hungary and Poland where it has gone down during last five years due to important structural weaknesses such as very high <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratio,</b> high share of foreign debts, and negative net position in the interbank market. Furthermore, we focus on determinants of liquid asset ratio. Results of the panel data regression analysis showed that the liquid asset ratio is mostly influenced by the size of the bank, its capital adequacy and profitability. Also overall macroeconomic conditions, such as growth rate of gross domestic product, the existence of financial crisis, exchange rate or rate of unemployment and the development of interest rates (both on loans and interbank transaction) are important. Although the Visegrad countries have a lot in common, different factors determined liquid asset ratio in individual countries and also the direction of influence of some factors may differ...|$|E
40|$|A {{recovering}} economy, {{along with}} loose credit {{in the wake}} of the U. S. quantitative easing (QE) measures, has boosted Hong Kong's economic activities in the last couple of years. Nonetheless, it is not altogether positive, as Hong Kong, under the linked exchange rate system (to the U. S. dollar), essentially does not have its own monetary policy, and is thus highly susceptible not only to U. S. monetary policies but also to hot money from abroad. The latter helps create a more uncertain, and riskier, market environment. In response, investors' portfolio selections change, and financial institutions adjust the supply of loans which essentially determines consumption and investment behaviours, including housing demand. In light of such an intertwined nature between these markets, this paper, using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, examines the inter-relationships between housing transaction volume and a variety of factors, such as money supply, housing price, banks' <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratio,</b> stock market returns, and best lending rate. The findings reveal that all those factors do have a one-directional long-run relationship with transaction volume, and that shocks in property price contribute the most to the forecast errors of property transactions. Interestingly, housing transaction volume responds to shocks in money supply negatively, rather than positively as usually reported in western literature. The reason can be attributed to the fact that the supply of money in Hong Kong, due to the linked exchange rate, is primarily subjected to the influx of hot money; and that investors, in response, prefer the stock market for its liquidity and lower cost over the property market. Then, as stock price increases, so does housing demand (transaction volume) due to the wealth effect. Policy implications, with reference to such effect, are then discussed.

40|$|From American {{subprime}} crisis to European debt crisis, {{the problem of}} liquidity risk in commercial banks is never out of the public’s sight. At each financial crisis, banks {{are the first to}} get into a dilemma. Due to the implicit government guarantee and a macro-economic liquidity surplus, Chinese banking system has experienced {{a relatively small number of}} bankruptcy and liquidity crises, which makes it not urgent to manage liquidity risk. However, the 2013 June Currency Shortage in China exposes the severe potential liquidity difficulties. Therefore, this dissertation aims to study current status of liquidity risk and liquidity risk management in Chinese banking system in the post-crisis era. Through the analysis of a series of static indicators, such as the non-performing loan ratio, the <b>loan-to-deposit</b> <b>ratio</b> and the liquidity ratio, it is believed that Chinese commercial banks are still in a condition of excessive liquidity. However, under the influences of new features in financial operation, such as financial disintermediation, inter-bank transaction and off-balance-sheet business, the liquidity risk exposure in Chinese commercial banks enlarges. Additionally, through empirical study of determinants of the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks, it can be estimated that the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks is generally under greater role by internal factors than by external ones. Banks’ asset size and profitability replenish the liquidity to withstand risks, while higher equity-to-assets ratio and non-performing loan ratio intensify the risk exposure. Banks which have implemented Basel III standards face less likelihood of liquidity risk exposure than banks which have not implemented. After analysing the differences between Basel III and Chinese regulatory rules and differences in the liquidity risk management modes between other countries and China, it can be concluded that the diversified, hierarchical and elaborated tendency of liquidity risk management and regulation in China is necessary.
