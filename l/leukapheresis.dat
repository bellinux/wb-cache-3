50|$|<b>Leukapheresis,</b> {{typically}} for granulocytes, is a rarely performed {{blood donation}} process.

50|$|CVac is an ex vivo {{dendritic}} cell priming technology involving MFP, or mannan fusion protein, where a fusion protein of MUC1 and Glutathione S-transferase is coupled to oxidized polymannose.

With CVac this takes place outside the body of the patient (ex vivo), with dendritic cells obtained by <b>leukapheresis.</b> The antigen in this case is MUC1, known to be overexpressed on a variety of cancer cells and in CVac MUC1 is conjugated to the carbohydrate mannan to facilitate uptake by the dendritic cells. CVAc can be administered subcutaneously, whereas Provenge is intravenous.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leukapheresis</b> may be {{performed}} to decrease {{a very high}} white blood cell count, to obtain autologous (i.e., the patient's own) blood cells for later transplant back into the patient, or to obtain cells for research purposes. In the case of hematological malignancies such as chronic leukemias, {{white blood cell counts}} may be high enough to cause leukostasis and [...] "sludging" [...] in the capillaries (acute leukemias have a more variable white cell count whereas chronic has a typically higher white cell count). This can affect retinal vasculature leading to vision changes, pulmonary vasculature leading to shortness of breath from decreased efficiency in oxygen exchange, as well as other organ systems such as the brain which would become clinically apparent with neurological deterioration of a patient from cerebrovascular compromise.|$|E
5000|$|Leukostasis is {{an extreme}} form of leukocytosis (an excess of white blood cells) that is dangerously symptomatic. It is {{therefore}} also called symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. It is a {{white blood cell count}} above 100,000/μL. It is characterized by abnormal intravascular leukocyte aggregation and clumping. It is most often seen in leukemia patients. The brain and lungs are the two most commonly affected organs. Occluded microcirculation causes local hypoxemia and hemorrage manifesting as headache, blurred vision, transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents and dyspnea. It is an acute syndrome requiring aggressive cytoreductive modalities including chemotherapy and/or <b>leukapheresis</b> to both reduce the number of circulating leukocytes and to break apart any aggregates that have already formed.

5000|$|Penicillin G is {{the drug}} of choice, {{although}} there have been some isolates found to show resistance. [...] C. canimorsus is susceptible to ampicillin, third generation cephalosporins, tetracyclines, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol. It has shown resistance to gentamicin. [...] Treatment is recommended for a minimum of three weeks. [...] Hospitalization is required in more severe infections. For cases of septicemia, high doses of penicillin are required. C. canimorsus is susceptible to clindamycin. [...] To control DIC, a condition often associated with sepsis, plasmaphoresis (separation and removal of blood plasma from blood cells) and/or <b>leukapheresis</b> (removal of excess white blood cells) are often utilized. Third generation cephalosporins are often given prior to diagnosis because they cover a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. After diagnosis, provided the strain is not beta-lactamase producing, medication should be switched to penicilin G.

In 211 (95 %) patients, the leukaphereses were started as planned at day 8, whereas in 8 (3 %) patients the procedure was postponed to day 9 and in 2 (1 %) patients to day 10. In the great majority of patients (77 %), the predefined amount of HPC could be collected with 1 <b>leukapheresis.</b> Forty-four (20 %) patients needed a second <b>leukapheresis,</b> whereas only 6 (3 %) patients required a third <b>leukapheresis</b> procedure.
