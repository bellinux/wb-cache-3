500|$|Even TIME {{magazine}} {{took note}} of Ward’s dominating performance. [...] Time noted: “The other entrants in the Intercollegiates last week had reason to consider with awe another athlete who—until he helped Michigan win the Western Conference title <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> 60½ points to Indiana's 47½ had not often been heard of outside the Midwest, except {{as a member of}} Michigan's football team. He was Willis Ward, 196-lb. Negro sophomore. At the Big Ten meet in Evanston last week. Willis Ward won the 100-yd. dash in 9.6 sec. He won the high jump, placed second in the broad jump. In the 120-yd. high hurdles, he forced Ohio State's Jack Keller to world's record time of 14.1 sec., finished a close second. The 18 points he won were what enabled Michigan to beat Indiana. They made his the most efficient individual performance in a Big Ten meet since Carl Johnson scored 20 points for Michigan in 1918. Quiet, unassuming, an above-average student of literature, Ward was the first Negro ever elected to Sphinx, Michigan's junior honor society.” ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was [...] "perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television," [...] it was [...] "much like the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> {{a little bit of}} been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it," [...] and that the plot was [...] "almost boilerplate for this genre." [...] By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that [...] "the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show needs to change things up." [...] Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; [...] "Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm." [...] In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's [...] "casual surrender", as [...] "in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide. What's this guy's deal? He obviously has a plan." [...] However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again, considering he subdued her in the previous episode.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode with a B grade, stating: [...] "Falling Skies premiered <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> a two-hour block that wasn’t so much an {{extended}} pilot but two episodes that [...] {{on the same}} night. That’s not necessarily a bad thing: While the first hour hummed along at a decent but semi-predictable pace, the second hour featured a fascinating detour into a high school that was more chamber drama than alien invasion. “Prisoner of War” returns to {{the format of the}} first hour, with an established theme depicted in the show’s title and a singular mission played out on multiple fronts. If anything stood out in this latest hour, it’s how shamelessly this show wears its narrative antecedents on its sleeve." ...|$|E

I've had people sit here all day and wait. The things I've seen here, well, if they were put into a story you couldn't hardly believe them. I had a poor woman come in here one morning <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> a baby in her arms, and three little {{children}} hanging round her, to wait for her husband; and she waited till midnight, and he didn't come. I could have told her first as well as last that he wasn't ever coming; I knew it from the kind of a letter he wrote her, and that she fished up out of her pocket to show me, so as to find whether she had come to the right place to wait, or not, but I couldn't bear to do it; and I did for her and the children as well as I could, and when it came to it, about twelve, I coaxed her to go home, and come again in the morning.

6000|$|Kitty innocently {{singled out}} the worst picture in the place as her favorite, and then was piqued, and {{presently}} frightened, at his cold reluctance about it. He made her feel {{that it was very}} bad, and that she shared its inferiority, though he said nothing to that effect. She learned the shame of not being a connoisseur in a connoisseur's company, and she perceived more painfully than ever before that a Bostonian, who had been much in Europe, might be very uncomfortable to the simple, unravelled American. Yet, she reminded herself, the Marches had been in Europe, and they were Bostonians also; and they did not go about putting everything under foot; they seemed to care for everything they saw, and to have a friendly jest, if not praises, for it. She liked that; she would have been well enough pleased to have Mr. Arbuton laugh outright at her picture, and she could have joined him in it. But the look, however flattered into an air of polite question at last, which he had bent upon her, seemed to outlaw her and condemn her taste in everything. As they passed out of the cathedral, she would rather have gone home than continued the walk as he begged her, if she were not tired, to do; but this would have been flight, and she was not a coward. So they sauntered down the Rue Fabrique, and turned into Palace Street. As they went by the door of Hôtel Musty, her pleasant friends came again into her mind, and she said, [...] "This is where we stayed <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> Mr. and Mrs. March." ...|$|E
60|$|About George's pictures, {{perhaps you}} better wait till I hear from him, before sending them. I remain well as usual. The poor fellow I {{mentioned}} {{in one of}} my letters <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> diarrhoea, that wanted me to ask God's blessing on him, was still living yesterday afternoon, but just living. He is only partially conscious, is all wasted away to nothing, and lies most of the time in half stupor, as they give him brandy copiously. Yesterday I was there by him a few minutes. He is very much averse to taking brandy, and there was some trouble in getting him to take it. He is almost totally deaf the last five or six days. There is no chance for him at all. Quite a particular friend of mine, Oscar Cunningham, an Ohio boy, had his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh. It was a pretty tough operation. He was badly wounded just a year ago to-day at Chancellorsville and has suffered a great deal; lately got erysipelas in his leg and foot. I forget whether I have mentioned him before or not. He was a very large, noble-looking young man when I first see him. The doctor thinks he will live and get up, but I consider [it] by no means so certain. He is very much prostrated. Well, dear mother, you must write and Jeff too--I do want to see you all very much. How does Mat get along, and how little Sis and all? I send my love to you and Jeff and all. We are having a very pleasant, coolish day here. I am going down to post office to leave this, and then up to my old friends the O'Connors to dinner, and then down to hospital. Well, good-bye, dear mother, for present.|$|E
