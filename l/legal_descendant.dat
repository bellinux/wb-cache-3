50|$|As a <b>legal</b> <b>descendant,</b> Sewon inevitably took on his father’s entire {{responsibility}} and restructured the foundation. He renounced {{all of his}} inheritance and donated most of his remaining personal assets for the financial recovery.|$|E
50|$|In 1428, he {{took the}} surname Frankopan, which is what all his sucessors {{henceforth}} called themselves. Two years later he visited Rome to have pope Martin V confirm him as a <b>legal</b> <b>descendant</b> of the old Roman patrician family Frangipani, who in turn claimed to have descended from the ancient gentis Anici. At this point, Nikola also had his family coat of arms altered for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of the founder and faced with the major Korean IMF {{financial}} crisis, the <b>legal</b> <b>descendant</b> Sewon Shin (a former artist well known as a genius young painter, until he gave up his art and majored in politics, philosophy and economics - PPE at Oxford University) restructured the Hanol-gyo foundation.During his leadership, Sewon refrained from the traditional concepts of ritual and transformed Hanol-gyo into a more liberal, flexible organization. In accordance with the founder's last will on the religious unification, he officially made religious conversion unnecessary and constitutionalized religious multiplicity so that the adherents of Hanol-gyo could participate in other religions as they wish and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Hereditary nobility (потомственное дворянство) was {{transferred}} to wife, children, and further direct <b>legal</b> <b>descendants</b> along the male (agnatic) line. In exceptional cases, the emperor could transfer nobility along indirect or female lines, e.g., to preserve a notable family name.|$|R
50|$|Titles were {{hereditary}} for all <b>legal</b> <b>descendants</b> in the male-line, {{male and}} female; primogeniture was not usual. Austria, however, legally abolished its nobility and hereditary titles after World War I and bans {{the use of}} noble titles and nobiliary particles.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population of Gorizia is of Roman Catholic denomination. The town is the seat of the Archbishop of Gorizia, {{who was one of the}} three <b>legal</b> <b>descendants</b> of the Patriarchate of Aquileia (along with the Patriarchate of Venice and the Archdiocese of Udine). Between mid-18th century and 1920, Gorizia was thus the center of a Metropolitan bishopric that comprised the Dioceses of Ljubljana, Trieste, Poreč-Pula and Krk. Several important religious figures lived and worked in Gorizia during this period, including Cardinal Jakob Missia, Bishop Frančišek Borgia Sedej, theologians Anton Mahnič and Josip Srebrnič, and Franciscan monk and philologian Stanislav Škrabec.|$|R
40|$|Guinn v. United States, :z 38 U. S. 347 (1915), argued 17 0 ct. 1913, decided 21 June 1915 by vote of 8 to 0 : White for the Court, McReynolds recused. To {{convince}} {{poor and}} illiterate whites to support literacy and property qualifications for voting, southern Democrats {{in the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries included escape clauses in their suffrage restriction laws. The least subtle of these was the grandfather clause, which allowed anyone to register to vote if he had been eligible in 1867, before the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified, or it he were a <b>legal</b> <b>descendant</b> of such a man. Some representatives of the southern upper class opposed this as too transparent an attempt to evade the Constitution, or because they wished to disfranchise the white, as well as the black, lower class...|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} County was of Roman Catholic denomination. Gorizia was one of the most important centers of the Catholic Church in Austria, since it was the seats of the Archbishops of Görz, who were one of the three <b>legal</b> <b>descendants</b> of the Patriarchate of Aquileia (along with the Patriarchate of Venice and the Archdiocese of Udine). Gorizia was thus the center of a Metropolitan bishopric that comprised the Dioceses of Ljubljana, Trieste, Poreč-Pula and Krk. Several important religious figures lived and worked in Gorizia, including cardinal Jakob Missia, bishop Frančišek Borgia Sedej, theologians Anton Mahnič and Josip Srebrnič, and Franciscan monk and philologian Stanislav Škrabec. There were many important Roman Catholic sacral buildings in the area, among them the sancturies of Sveta Gora ("Holy Mountain") and Barbana, and the monastery of Kostanjevica. Most of the County was included into the Archbidiocese of Gorizia, with the exception of the south-western portion of the Karst Plateau (around Sežana), which was included in the Diocese of Trieste.|$|R
50|$|The manor of Glooston was {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book as being held by Hugh de Grentemesnil. From 1180 {{to the middle of}} the 14th century the Basset family of Drayton were mesne tenants. The manor was held of the Bassets by the Harington family, and from c. 1412-1422 held by the Brauncepath family, through the marriage of Margaret Harington to Richard Brauncepath. The manor passed to John Colly, a distant Harington relative, in 1480 after a protracted <b>legal</b> dispute. His <b>descendant</b> Anthony Colly put the manor in trust in 1587 to pay an annuity of £100 for 60 years to a skinner, Randall Manning of London. This payment was in arrears by 1592, and possession of the manor passed to Manning. In 1614 Colly redeemed it for £1,500, and in 1632 he sold it to the Brudenell family for £4,500, in whose possession it has remained.|$|R
50|$|Gary Lewis is {{also the}} first person of known Māori descent to join the {{extended}} Royal Family, or to marry {{the daughter of a}} British prince. As Davina is a legitimate descendant in the male line of King George II and therefore a potential heir to the British throne, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required that Royal Assent to the wedding be obtained in advance for the marriage to be <b>legal</b> and the <b>descendants</b> thereof to inherit rights of succession to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, including that of New Zealand. On 20 July 2004, the Queen-in-Council formally declared her consent to Lady Davina's union with Lewis. The wedding took place at the chapel of Kensington Palace, Lady Davina's childhood home. Apart from the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the bride's siblings, no other members of the Royal Family were present at the wedding; only close friends and family were involved.|$|R
