40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern {{regarding}} the welfare of laying hens worldwide and there are both ethical and economic reasons for improving their welfare. Although several different welfare indicators are used today, their ability to accurately reflect welfare status is sometimes questioned. This thesis sought to increase knowledge regarding a number of these welfare indicators by investigating whether and to what extent they were affected when layers were exposed to different stressors. Three different commercial laying hen genotypes were used and birds were challenged by being excluded either from their nests in furnished cages or from the <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> in a single-tier floor system. Excluding birds from their nests resulted in an increased stress response that was detectable in corticosterone metabolites in droppings, corticosterone concentration in egg yolk, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio and egg shell irregularities. Excluding birds from the <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> during the first two weeks in the laying facility resulted in differences in feather cover, approaches towards a novel object, tonic immobility duration and egg shell irregularities measured later in the laying period. Interestingly, according to the welfare indicators used, birds previously excluded from the <b>litter</b> <b>area,</b> and consequently deprived of litter and available area, had better welfare than non-excluded birds. In addition, levels of corticosterone metabolites in droppings were influenced by factors such as diet, genotype, bird age, cage tier, droppings mass, time of day and the kind of assay used. The results showed that several, but not all, indicators were able to detect different stress responses, suggesting that they are more or less appropriate to use depending on the situation prevailing. Many factors influenced the results obtained and there were few and inconsistent correlations, displaying a complex relationship between indicators. Overall, this indicates that welfare assessment should preferably be based on results from several indicators and that careful interpretation of the results is required before stating firm conclusions regarding laying hen welfare...|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} years we {{measured}} the amounts of leaf litter and ascospore production per unit of leaf <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> in 7 organic pear orchards throughout the Netherlands. In one of the orchards, adapted managements strategies were implemented two years ago, being grass/clover that is grown as ground cover on the tree-strip, and organic cattle-manure that replaces chicken manure pellets, in order to stimulate the earthworm population and change the palatability of the leaf litter. First results indicate large differences between orchards in percentage of ground covered by dead leaves {{at the time of}} major ascospore infections, but also in number of ascospores per cm 2 leaf litter and in resulting potential ascospore dose. We used these data, together with weather data (temperature, rainfall), in a simple multivariate analysis to gain insight in the dynamics of the system. In 2010, 85 % of the variation in pear scab was explained with a model with rainfall during summer and the amount of asco sores per unit of leaf area. In 2011, 81 % of the variation was explained by a model with the amounts of ascospores per unit leaf area and the potential ascospore dose. In the adapted management experiment we measured no changes in leaf litter in the treatments yet.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was carried out}} on the leaf litter of 8 agroforestry plant species of the Sudano-guinea Savannas of Ngaoundere in order to compare patterns of their water absorption and dynamics of four important energetic organic compounds (soluble sugars, cellulose, phenol and lignin) among these plant species during the leaching phase and to {{determine the influence of}} initial litter properties on these processes. To this end, 168 samples of leaf litter (5. 00 +/- 0. 01 g) of Annona senegalensis, Lophira lanceolata, Syzygium guineense var. guineense, Syzygium guineense var. macrocarpum, Vitellaria paradoxa, Vitex doniana, Vitex madiensis and Ximenia americana were immersed for 15 days in distilled water at a temperature of 23 °C and relative humidity of 65 +/- 1 %. Three samples of each plant species were taken at 1, 6, 24, 72, 168, 240 and 360 hours. Depending on the species, water absorption capacity after 360 h of leaching varied from 162. 77 (S. g. var. macrocarpum) to 264. 00 % (V. madiensis) of dry litter mass. The release of water-soluble substances varied between 9. 61 (L. lanceolata) and 34. 12 % (X. americana). Water absorption and release of water-soluble substances rate constants were the highest in V. madiensis (0. 32 h- 1 and 0. 25 h- 1) and the lowest one respectively in S. g. guineense (0. 03 h- 1) and S. g. var. macrocarpum (0. 006 h- 1). Organic compound of original litter also varied significantly among species and decreased with leaching time for water-soluble sugars and phenols, while increased for cellulose and lignin. Water absorption by litter was significantly correlated with initial water-soluble sugars and phenol content, leaf <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> and thickness. The release of water-soluble substances by litters was also correlated with initial water-soluble sugars, water content and leaf <b>litter</b> <b>area.</b> The leaching rate constant was correlated with that of water absorption. These preliminary results lead {{to a better understanding of}} the litter decomposition processes of agroforestry plant species of Ngaoundere and thus help in making the most appropriate choice of indigenous plant species for domestication that could help to improve soil fertility and eventually to protect the biodiversity...|$|E

Environment enrichment, e. g., providing access to litter, to increase foraging behavior in laying hens {{has been shown to}} decrease feather pecking.

These treatments were compared with a control involving hens given the commercial feed, but no mussel shells in the litter. The study included 900 Dekalb White layers housed in a single-tier floor system during a production cycle (20 to 72 wk of age). The mussel shells were consumed to a lower extent than predicted, resulting in calcium deficiency in hens fed the low-calcium diet. This in turn was evident as increased degree of keel bone deviations and lower eggshell breaking strength. Daily addition of crushed mussel shells to the litter for laying hens on a balanced or calcium-deficient diets did not generate any positive effects on bird feather cover, eggshell quality, production performance, or fearfulness. Hence, with the particle size of mussel shells used in this study, there was no indication of improved welfare due to environment enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Litter {{decomposition}} {{contributes to}} one of the largest fluxes of carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and is a primary control on nutrient cycling. The inability of models using climate and litter chemistry to predict decomposition in dry environments has stimulated investigation of non-traditional drivers of decomposition, including photodegradation, the abiotic decomposition of organic matter via exposure to solar radiation. Recent work in this developing field shows that photodegradation may substantially influence terrestrial C fluxes, including abiotic production of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Research has also produced contradictory results regarding controls on photodegradation. Here we summarize the state of knowledge about the role of photodegradation in litter decomposition and C cycling and investigate drivers of photodegradation across experiments using a meta-analysis. Overall, increasing litter exposure to solar radiation increased mass loss by 23 % with large variation in photodegradation rates among and within ecosystems. This variation was tied to both litter and environmental characteristics. Photodegradation increased with litter C to nitrogen (N) ratio, but not with lignin content, suggesting that we do not yet fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Photodegradation also increased with factors that increased solar radiation exposure (latitude and <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> to mass ratio) and decreased with mean annual precipitation. The impact of photodegradation on C (and potentially N) cycling fundamentally reshapes our thinking of decomposition as a solely biological process and requires that we define the mechanisms driving photodegradation before we can accurately represent photodegradation in global C and N models. © 2012 US Government...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOrganic {{rules for}} grazing {{and access to}} outdoor areas in pig {{production}} may be met in different ways, which express compromises between considerations for animal welfare, feed self-reliance and negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate pollution. This article compares {{the environmental impact of}} the main organic pig systems in Denmark. Normally, sows are kept in huts on grassland and finishing pigs are raised in stables with access to an outdoor run. One alternative practice is also rearing the fattening pigs on grassland all year round. The third method investigated was a one-unit pen system mainly consisting of a deep <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> under a climate tent and with restricted access to a grazing area. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the emissions of greenhouse gases of the free range system were estimated to be 3. 3 kg CO 2 -equivalents kg− 1 live weight pig, which was significantly higher than the indoor fattening system and the tent system, yielding 2. 9 and 2. 8 kg CO 2 -eq. kg− 1 pig, respectively. This was 7 - 22 % higher compared with Danish conventional pig production but, due to the integration of grass-clover in the organic crop rotations these had an estimated net soil carbon sequestration. When carbon sequestration was included in the LCA then the organic systems had lower greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional pig production. Eutrophication in nitrate equivalents per kg pig was 21 - 65 % higher in the organic pig systems and acidification was 35 - 45 % higher per kg organic pig compared with the conventional system. We conclude that, even though the free range system theoretically has agro-ecological advantages over the indoor fattening system and the tent system due to a larger grass-clover area, this potential is difficult to implement in practice due to problems with leaching on sandy soil. Only if forage can contribute to a larger proportion of the pigfeed uptake may the free range system be economically and environmentally competitive. Improvement of nitrogen cycling and efficiency is the most important factor for reducing the overall environmental load from organic pig meat. Presently, a system with pig fattening in stables and concrete-covered outdoor runs seems to be the best solution from an environmental point of view...|$|E
40|$|Organic pig {{production}} {{has emerged as}} an alternative to the intensive conventional {{pig production}} in Europe with the animals confined indoors and often an imbalance between livestock and land for feed production and manure utilisation. The organic systems aim at improving animal welfare by supporting the pig’s natural behaviour (Hermansen et al., 2003), and improving soil fertility by better linking crop and livestock production from an agro-ecological point of view. The differences between organic and conventional pig production is more fundamental than for example differences between dairy production systems, which may be why the share of pig herds within the organic holdings is considerably lower than the percentage of pig herds in conventional agriculture in both the UK (ADAS, 2001), Germany (Willer, et al., 2002) and Denmark (Plant Directorate, 2004 b). However, the recent development has seen a dramatic increase in demand for organic pig meat in Denmark, Germany and the UK and present production cannot meet demand. Besides regulation on use of feedstuffs, the organic pig production has a main challenge in the regulation for housing. The sows need access to grazing in the summer time, and growing pigs need as a minimum requirement access to an outdoor run. In addition, the area requirements for indoor housing are higher than for conventional production. These requirements have a major impact on what systems to consider, both from economical and agro-ecological points of view. And therefore, efforts to improve organic pig production should focus on the integration of livestock production and land use, but considering environmental impacts on local and global scales. The most commonly used system in Denmark is to combine an outdoor sow production all year round with rearing growing pigs in barns with an outdoor run (Hermansen & Jakobsen, 2004). The type of stable most commonly used by full time producers in Denmark is a system with deep litter in the entire indoor area or deep litter/straw bed in half the area while the outdoor area consists of a concrete area. The use of a concrete covered area, from which the manure can be collected, is a way to comply with the environmental regulations stating that the outdoor run should be constructed in a way that prevents leaching. Research shows that very good production results can be obtained in such systems in terms of litter size, daily gain, feed consumption and health (Hermansen et al., 2003). However, two possible drawbacks exist. First, the space requirement per growing pig in housing facilities is considerable and, thus, capital demanding. For fattening pigs of 85 - 100 kg live weight, the indoor space required is equivalent to 1. 3 m 2 /pig (of which at least 0. 65 m 2 must consists of a solid floor) and 1. 0 m 2 outdoors run (Council Regulation, 1999). In addition, each lying zone, i. e. straw bedding area, must be able to accommodate all pigs at a time. This put a heavy burden on costs of buildings (money and resource use) and at the same time it can be questioned if such rearing systems comply with the consumer expectations. Second, the outdoor sow production has been connected with high environmental burden in the form of N losses (Larsen et al., 2000; Eriksen et al., 2002). This made us to consider two alternatives to the organic pic system most often used presently. A system where all pigs were reared outdoors on grassland (and saving buildings) and a system where sows and growing pigs were kept in a tent system placed upon a deep <b>litter</b> <b>area</b> in order to reduce risk for N leaching. Both have been used under commercial conditions. In order to assess the possible trade-offs between environmental impacts on the one hand and the assumed advantages of these alternative systems (animal welfare, low investment) on the other hand an Environmental Impact Assessment was needed. Environmental assessment of livestock farming systems can be done on an area basis (e. g. nutrient losses per ha) or on a product basis (e. g. Green House Gas emission per kg meat or milk; Haas et al., 2001; van der Werf & Petit, 2002; De Boer, 2003; Halberg et al., 2005). The area based assessment is relevant for locally important emissions such as nitrate leaching but a product based assessment is more relevant for emissions, which have a less localised impact (acidification) or even a global character (Green House Gasses). Moreover, since the organic production is often considered a more sustainable alternative to conventional intensive pig production, from a consumer point of view it might be interesting to compare the eutrophication per kg meat produced from different organic and compared to conventional systems. The objective of this paper is to compare the environmental impact and green house gas emission of organic pig production systems with different levels of integration of livestock and land use. ...|$|E

40|$|Billions {{of laying}} hens are kept worldwide. Severe feather pecking (SFP) is a {{behaviour}} which occurs {{with a high}} prevalence on commercial farms. SFP, the pecking and plucking of feathers of another bird, induces pain and stress and can ultimately lead to cannibalism. Moreover, SFP can occur if a bird is unable to cope with fear and stress and is living in an inappropriate environment. SFP thus reduces the welfare of many laying hens worldwide. To prevent SFP {{it is essential to}} know the risk factors in its development. To that aim, first, two experimental studies were conducted to gain insight in the principles of SFP, and three on-farm studies were conducted to assess the risk factors of SFP under commercial conditions. THE PRINCIPLES Factors which relate to SFP are high fearfulness as young and low levels of brain and peripheral serotonin (5 -HT) and brain dopamine (DA). Furthermore, commercial laying hen lines can differ in SFP tendencies and associated traits indicating that SFP has a genetic component. In chapters 2 and 3, fear response as young and adult, and stress response, 5 -HT and DA brain levels as adult were compared in hens of two lines: the low mortality line (LML) selected on low levels of mortality due to cannibalism and individual performance vs. the control line (CL) which was selected on individual performance only. Hens were exposed to an Open Field (OF) test at 5 weeks of age and a Manual Restraint (MR) test at 33 weeks of age. At 33 weeks of age, levels of corticosterone (CORT) post MR and 5 -HT and DA levels in four brain areas were determined. Hens of the LML were less fearful at both ages and had lower levels of DA in the arcopallium, a somatomotor area involved in fear and motor control, compared to hens of the CL. In chapter 2, it was also shown that fearful chicks had higher levels of CORT and higher activity levels as adult, compared to non-fearful chicks. Moreover, presence of fearful animals in the group was related to average CORT levels of their pen members. Fearful hens may induce social instability in a group, and thereby affecting the stress-sensitivity of their group mates. These results indicate that groups differ in levels of fear and stress-sensitivity, and that fearfulness at a young age can lead to stress-sensitivity as adults, which create a risk for development of SFP. THE PRACTICE In chapters 4, 5 and 6, the laying hen production chain consisting of parent stock, rearing flocks and laying flocks was studied. Risk factors for SFP could originate from previous parts in the chain. Therefore, in all on-farm studies, measurements of SFP, fearfulness, basal CORT and peripheral 5 -HT system were obtained, and related to housing conditions and to previous parts in the chain. Fearfulness was assessed, on a flock level, by distance to a stationary person (SP) test and latency of bird to approach a novel object (NO). Dekalb White (DW) and ISA brown (ISA) crosses whose pure lines differ in levels of fear, CORT, 5 -HT and DA, were compared. First, parent stock (PS) flocks were studied and associations between production performance and measurements of fear, stress and 5 -HT were conducted and related to group size conditions (chapter 4). Second, rearing flocks originating from PS flocks were studied throughout the rearing period (chapter 5). High levels of feather damage, CORT and 5 -HT in the mothers were related to fearfulness and SFP in their offspring at flock level. Especially, a large flock size and limitation and/or disruption in litter supply affected SFP and levels of fearfulness and 5 -HT (chapter 5). Finally, high levels of feather damage during the laying period were related to high SFP rearing, and high fearfulness during rearing and laying (chapter 6). These studies together aimed to determine the risk factors for the development of SFP and the resulting feather damage. The main outcomes of these studies are as follows. Ø Parent stock flocks DW flocks were more fearful of an SP and hens had higher levels of feather damage than in ISA flocks. ISA flocks, in turn, were more fearful of the NO and hens had higher 5 -HT levels than in DW flocks. A small flock size led to higher feed conversion, mortality levels, and smothering events in ISA but not in DW flocks. These results indicate that DW and ISA PS flocks differ in levels of fear and feather damage, and respond differently to their social environment. For both crosses, fear of an SP related to high mortality and fear of the NO related to low hen body weight, egg weight, and feed intake. High basal CORT related to low egg weight. High fear and stress levels in PS flocks may, thus, negatively affect (re) production, and thereby potentially negatively influence the developing embryo. Ø Rearing flocks In the DW cross, high CORT, feather damage, and 5 -HT of mother hens related to high SFP and fearfulness of their rearing flocks at 1 week of age. At 5 weeks of age, a peak in both gentle feather pecking (GFP) and SFP was recorded, coinciding with a disruption in substrate availability (i. e. a temporal absence of substrate) and a limitation of substrate (i. e. limited amounts of substrate provided) in some of the farms. Especially, ISA pullets showed higher SFP under substrate limitation and became more fearful under substrate disruption than DW pullets. ISA pullets had higher 5 -HT levels than DW pullets. Only in the ISA cross, high 5 -HT related to high fearfulness, specifically under substrate disruption. For both crosses, high fearfulness was related to high feather damage. Furthermore, in a level system (floor system where levels are gradually added) higher levels of SFP and feather damage were found compared to an aviary system (a tier-system with cages and <b>litter</b> <b>area).</b> These results highlight that; 1) parental effects exist in the development of fearfulness and SFP, 2) disruption and limitation in substrate availability can lead to high SFP at 5 weeks of age, 3) ISA pullets are more strongly influenced by environmental conditions than DW pullets and 4) a level housing, which coincided with a large group size, increase the risk of SFP and feather damage during rearing. Ø Laying flocks In our sample, 49 % of the laying flocks had severe damage at 40 weeks of age, compared with 71 %, 65 % and 53 % of the rearing flocks at 15, 10 and 5 weeks of age, respectively. High fear of a SP at rearing and high SFP at 5 weeks of age related to high levels of feather damage at lay. In a floor system and at a large flock size higher levels of feather damage were recorded than in an aviary system and at a small flock size. An adjusted management on the laying farm (i. e. aerated blocks, presence of roosters or a radio playing) reduced levels of feather damage compared to standard management. DW flocks were more fearful of the SP and NO than ISA flocks. This study showed that factors during rearing and laying contributed to feather damage at 40 weeks of age. With the knowledge from the experimental and on-farm studies in this thesis, an assessment of the risk factors for SFP could be established. Risk factors for SFP are: high fear, stress and feather damage in DW parent stock, high fear of humans, especially for DW hens, litter disruption or limitation during rearing, large group sizes, and a floor or level system...|$|E
50|$|Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, {{some with}} needles and some without, <b>littered</b> the <b>area</b> where {{the bodies were}} found. Mootoo {{concluded}} that a gunshot wound to Annie Moore {{could not have been}} self-inflicted, though Moore had also ingested a lethal dose of cyanide.|$|R

The Old North Harwich railroad station site {{is still there}} today {{even though it has}} since been turned into factories. On Queen Anne, multiple warehouses and factories <b>litter</b> the <b>area</b> including the Harwich Town Dump.|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{the growing}} {{quantity}} of plastic wastes {{has become one}} of the most important pollution/environmental issues in the world. The solution of this problem may be an improvement of the biodegradation process. Microbial activity can be used instead of the conventional methods. Researchers are searching for microorganisms that can effectively decompose huge quantities of plastic wastes. Research is focused on unconventional and wide-range resources; for this reason microorganisms are isolated from <b>littered</b> <b>areas,</b> but also from unusual places, such as the depths of the seas (Sekiguchi et al. 2010), gastric juices of worms (Yang et al. 2014) and the surface of leaves (Kitamoto et al. 2011). Searching for microorganisms in various, untypical environments is surprisingly effective, therefore the research should be conducted for both conventional plastic and bioplastic.|$|R
50|$|Paphiopedilum malipoense {{is found}} in {{northern}} Vietnam and southern China at the elevation of 570 to 1600 meters. It is found growing on limestone cliffs with leaf <b>litter.</b> The <b>area</b> where this plant is found is subjected to heavy fog {{in the winter and}} rain in the early spring and summer.|$|R
50|$|Paphiopedilum ooii {{is found}} {{on the island of}} Borneo in the state of Sabah, Malaysia at {{elevations}} of 1050 meters. Plants are found on sharp cliffs growing in moss and leaf <b>litter.</b> The <b>area</b> is subjected to heavy rain from fall to early spring. The area is rarely dry and usually very foggy.|$|R
50|$|The steep {{cliffs and}} hills {{rising out of}} the sea on all sides, along with the {{frequent}} sea mists, have made the area a hazard to flight. It has been the site of numerous air crashes throughout aviation history, and the remains of some of those crashed aircraft still <b>litter</b> the <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{the school}} {{received}} an addition {{onto the back}} of the school, adding fourteen classrooms and a second story, which removed the 12 portables that previously <b>littered</b> the <b>area.</b> The school's student council has worked towards creating better school spirit by pushing for a uniform free week, as well as a second semi-formal.|$|R
50|$|As {{alternatives}} to battery cages, Directive 1999/74/EC allows non-cage systems and furnished cages. Furnished cages therefore represent a feasible alternative to battery cages in the EU after 2012. Under the directive, furnished cages must provide {{at least the}} following: 750 cm2 per hen, of which 600 cm2 is 45 cm high, a nest, a <b>littered</b> <b>area</b> for scratching and pecking, 15 cm of perch and 12 cm of food trough per hen and a claw shortening device. Austria banned battery cages in 2009 and is set to ban furnished cages by 2020. Belgium has also banned the battery cage - and proposes to ban furnished cages by 2024. Germany has introduced a ‘family cage’, which has more space than the furnished cages used in other countries, however, consumers in Germany have been rejecting these eggs. Outside the EU, Switzerland has already banned both the battery and furnished cage systems.|$|R
