50|$|In {{recent years}} the Pound-Drever-Hall {{technique}} has become a mainstay of laser frequency stabilization. Frequency stabilization is needed for high precision because all lasers demonstrate frequency wander at some level. This instability is primarily due to temperature variations, mechanical imperfections, and laser gain dynamics, which change laser cavity lengths, <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> current and voltage fluctuations, atomic transition widths, and many other factors. PDH locking offers one possible {{solution to this problem}} by actively tuning the laser to match the resonance condition of a stable reference cavity.|$|E
5000|$|With [...] "classical" [...] devices like NIF about 330 MJ of {{electrical}} power {{are used to}} produce the driver beams, producing an expected yield of about 20 MJ, with the maximum credible yield of 45 MJ. Using the same sorts of numbers in a reactor combining fast ignition with newer lasers would offer dramatically improved performance. HiPER requires about 270 kJ of laser energy, so assuming a first-generation diode <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> at 10% the reactor would require about 3 MJ {{of electrical}} power. This is expected to produce about 30 MJ of fusion power. Even a very poor conversion to electrical energy appears to offer real-world power output, and incremental improvements in yield and laser efficiency appear {{to be able to}} offer a commercially useful output.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} laser wakefield {{electron}} acceleration (LWFA) using mid-IR <b>laser</b> <b>drivers</b> is a promising path for future laser driven electronaccelerators, {{when compared to}} traditional near-IR <b>laser</b> <b>drivers</b> uperating at 0. 8 - 1 μm central wavelength (λlaser), as the necessary vector potential a_ 0 for electron injection can be achieved with smaller laser powers due to the linear dependence on λlaser. In this work, we perform 2 D PIC simulations on LWFA using few-cycle high power (5 - 15 TW) laser systems with λlaser ranging from 0. 88 - 10 μm. Such few-cycle systems are currently under development, aiming at Gas High Harmonics Generation applications where the favourable λlaser^ 2 scaling extends the range of XUV photon energies. We keep a_ 0 and n_e/n_cr (n_e being the plasma density and n_cr being the critical density for each λlaser) as common denominators in outr simulations, allowing for comparisons between drivers of different λlaser, {{with respect to the}} accelerated electron beam energy, charge, and conversion efficiency. While the electron energies are mainly dominated by the plasma dynamics, the laser to electron beam energy conversion efficiency shows significant enhancement with longer wavelength <b>laser</b> <b>drivers.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures To be published in NIM A proceeding...|$|R

The HSS <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> is designed using current mode logic (CML) technique, which is widely used technique for designing optical components. CML technique provides the strength to the <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> for high frequencies mid-range infrared range.

40|$|The {{laser drivers}} are {{extremely}} important {{to be used to}} provide safe interface for the optical components attached to the laser. In this paper, energy efficient <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> circuit is design using field programming gate array (FPGA). The <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> is first designed using current mode logic (CML) technique, which is widely used for designing the optical components. Then this design is implemented on FPGA using very large scale integration (VLSI). The <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> produces the energy efficient output using voltage scaling technique in which the core voltage of FPGA virtex- 7 board is reduced from 2. 2 V (Peak core voltage of FPGA) to 0. 5 V (base voltage of FPGA). By reducing core voltage of FPGA virtex- 7 from peak to base voltage the power consume by laser drivers is reduced up to 90 % for 15 THz frequency. Similarly, for less than 15 THz frequencies the power consumption is also reduced. The main advantage of designing this energy efficient <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> is that it will control the output of any high frequency semiconductor laser up to 15 THz frequency.

40|$|We {{explore a}} plasma based {{analogue}} of a helical undulator {{capable of providing}} circularly and elliptically polarised betatron radiation. We focus on ionisation injection configurations and in the conditions where the <b>laser</b> pulse <b>driver</b> can force collective betatron oscillations over the whole trapped electron bunch. With an analytical model and by employing three dimensional simulations and radiation calculations, we find that circularly or elliptically polarised <b>laser</b> <b>drivers</b> can force helical betatron oscillations, which produce circularly/elliptically polarised betatron x-rays. We assess the level of polarisation numerically and analytically, and find {{that the number of}} circularly polarised photons can be controlled by tuning the <b>laser</b> pulse <b>driver</b> polarisation. We show the production of betatron radiation that is circularly polarised up to < 40 % close to regions of maximum photon flux. The total flux of circularly polarised betatron radiation drops for elliptically polarised drivers, and is negligible when using linear polarisation.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} and engineers designing laser drivers for data rates {{at or above}} 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) implemented their designs using integrated circuit technologies that provide high bandwidth and good quality passive components such as GaAs, silicon bipolar, and InP. However, in low-cost and high volume short-haul applications at data rates of around 10 Gbps (such as LAN, MAN, and board-to-board interconnection), {{there has been an}} increasing interest in commercial CMOS technology for implementing the <b>laser</b> <b>driver.</b> This is because CMOS technology has unique advantages such as low power and low cost of fabrication that are the result of high yield and a high degree of integration. Therefore, the objective of this research in this dissertation is to investigate the possibility of implementing a high-speed CMOS <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> for these cost sensitive applications. The high-speed CMOS laser drivers designed in this research are of two types. The first type is a low power <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> for driving a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The other driver type is a high current <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> for driving edge-emitting lasers such as double-heterojunction (DH), multiquantum well (MQW), or Febry-Perrot (FP) lasers. The parasitic effects of the layout geometry are crucial {{in the design of the}} high-speed laser drivers. Thus, in this research, all simulations contain a complete set of parasitic elements extracted from the layout of the <b>laser</b> <b>driver.</b> To test laser drivers, chip-on-board (COB) technology is employed, and printed circuit boards (PCBs) to test the laser drivers are designed at the same time as the laser drivers themselves and manufactured specifically for these tests. This research makes two significant new contributions to the technology that are reported and described here. One is the first 10 Gbps performance of a differential CMOS <b>laser</b> <b>driver</b> with better than 10 - 14 bit-error-rate (BER).

40|$|The {{reliability}} and lifetime of laser diodes {{is critical to}} space missions. The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission includes a metrology system that is based upon laser diodes. An operational test facility has been developed to qualify and select, by mission standards, laser diodes that will survive the intended space environment and mission lifetime. The facility is situated in an electrostatic discharge (ESD) certified clean-room and consist of an enclosed temperature-controlled stage that can accommodate up to 20 laser diodes. The facility is designed to characterize a single laser diode, in addition to conducting laser lifetime testing on up to 20 laser diodes simultaneously. A standard <b>laser</b> current <b>driver</b> is used to drive a single laser diode. Laser diode current, voltage, power, and wavelength are measured for each laser diode, and a method of selecting the most adequate laser diodes for space deployment is implemented. The method consists of creating histograms of laser threshold currents, powers at a designated current, and wavelengths at designated power. From these histograms, the laser diodes that illustrate a performance that is outside the normal are rejected and the remaining lasers are considered spaceborne candidates. To perform laser lifetime testing, the facility is equipped with 20 custom <b>laser</b> <b>drivers</b> that were designed and built by California Institute of Technology specifically to drive NuSTAR metrology <b>lasers.</b> The <b>laser</b> <b>drivers</b> can be operated in constant-current mode or alternating-current mode.
