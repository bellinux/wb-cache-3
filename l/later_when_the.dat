5|$|Chelvanayakam was a Protestant Christian and {{a member}} of the Church of South India (CSI).

Though a Christian, Chelvanayakam absorbed many of the values of Hinduism. He claimed he was a Christian by religion and a Hindu by culture.|$|E

5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted ten years <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with {{an army of}} 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E

5|$|During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, Bahia {{served with}} Rio Grande do Sul—until that ship defected—and {{five or six}} destroyers {{off the coast of}} Santa Catarina; they were once again {{commanded}} by Belford Gomes. Two years <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> state of São Paulo rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution, Bahia—under the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre Boiteux—and other vessels blockaded the rebel-held port of Santos. Bahia was under repair from 1934 into 1935. In November 1935, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul sailed to Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte, to lend support against another rebellion. As part of their mission, they were ordered to sink the steamship Santos on sight, as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{served in}} Congress {{through some of}} the darkest days of the Revolutionary War. The British drove Washington from New York and New Jersey in 1776, which {{prompted}} Congress to flee to Baltimore, Maryland. Hancock and Congress returned to Philadelphia in March 1777, but were compelled to flee six months <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> British occupied Philadelphia. Hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials, raising money, supplies, and troops for Washington's army. He chaired the Marine Committee, and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of American frigates, including the USS Hancock, which was named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> United States Numbered Highway System was created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E

By the next year, M-24 was designated from downtown Pontiac northward to Lapeer. M-24 was moved to an eastern bypass of town in 1936, and the former routing in town became M-24A. This was redesignated Bus M-24 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Ernest O. Thompson, a {{decorated}} World War I general {{and a major}} businessman in Amarillo, was elected mayor to succeed Lee Bivins. Thompson instituted a major capital-improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates. He joined the Texas Railroad Commission by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, and 1958. He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation.

Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper {{at the bottom of}} a drawer.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that these {{appointments}} were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution, rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Irish Free State formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made.|$|E
5|$|Khazir {{was a major}} {{setback for}} the Umayyads, who did not launch another {{invasion}} of Iraq until 691. However, al-Mukhtar's victory was short-lived as he was killed a year <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Zubayrids took over Kufa. Meanwhile, the blood feud between the Qaysi and Yamani tribal elements of the Umayyad Caliphate intensified due to Umayr's mid-battle defection and subsequent spearheading of attacks against the tribes of Taghlib and Kalb. In these later battles, the Kalb were led by Humayd ibn Hurayth al-Kalbi, an Umayyad commander who survived Khazir.|$|E
