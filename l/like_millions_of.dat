500|$|Historian Reuth {{observes that}} the modern German image of Rommel (a result of the Historikerstreit in the 1980s and debates on war guilt during the 1990s), as {{represented}} most notably by Maurice Remy, is that of both a National Socialist and a hero of the Resistance. Reuth argues that [...] "Rommel was neither one nor the other. He had understood neither National Socialism, nor the resistance to it. <b>Like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Germans he followed Hitler into disaster and whilst doing so he believed he was only doing his duty".|$|E

500|$|Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, Caitlin Thomas– Leftover Life to Kill (1957) and My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story (1997), {{describe}} the destructive effect of alcoholism on the poet {{and to their}} relationship. [...] "But ours was a drink story, not a love story, just <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> others. Our one and only true love was drink", she wrote and [...] "The bar was our altar". Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the demise of Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. Thomas died intestate with assets {{to the value of}} £100.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{were made}} {{as early as}} 1937 by Walt Disney to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, [...] "The Snow Queen", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, {{who served as the}} basis for Princess Anna, and the other named Kai, who is [...] "cursed with negativity" [...] after his heart is pierced with a shard of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen. However, Disney {{struggled}} with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's title character, who was intended to be a villain. In the story, she is described as [...] "a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice—shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in their glance." [...] Disney was unable {{to find a way to}} make the Snow Queen more real and eventually abandoned film plans.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> {{people in}} the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family {{suffered}} during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately [...] inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months {{until the end of}} the occupation. His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, returning only after the war in 1945. In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.|$|E
2500|$|The {{programme}} features {{some insight}} into certain shots. Dennis Taylor asks Steve Davis about one shot in particular, a potentially key shot (if Taylor had potted his first clear chance at the black.) After Taylor had missed the initial double into the centre pocket and then the long double into the top pocket, Davis was left {{with a chance to}} either double the black into the top right hand pocket, or play the black [...] "around the angles" [...] with a chance of making the [...] "cocked hat" [...] shot into the centre pocket. Taylor, <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> TV viewers watching that night, did not know which of the two shots Davis had played. Davis confirmed that he had in fact played the latter, but had not got the angle necessary to pull it off easily. In fact, he states that it may have worked but [...] "I hit it too hard, the white checked up (left the cushion too straight.)" ...|$|E

5000|$|As the {{anthropologist}} Geraldine Chatelard has written, Jordanian officials initially viewed the Iraqis {{as a security}} and economic issue and not a humanitarian concern. The officials feared that {{an emphasis on the}} crisis narrative would lead to Iraqis becoming <b>like</b> the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian refugees already in Jordan. For this reason, the Government of Jordan argued that the displaced Iraqis were not refugees, but [...] "guests" [...] who would return to Iraq.|$|R

6000|$|Not merely so, but {{the girl}} felt in herself {{potentialities}} not yet drawn upon, unlimited capabilities leading towards the accomplishment of good. Money had not merely the magic of exalting, educating, refining, and ennobling the individual (herself); it had radiating, transforming power for others. It could diffuse warmth like a flame, and send forth joy like a bell. [...] "With it I am safe, strong: I can help the poor. Without it I am only a struggling girl, <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> others, with no chance and no power to aid those who suffer." [...] But at this point her love re-entered and her sense of right was confused. After all the heart ruled.|$|E

When I met you, I {{suddenly}} began to realise {{what it would be}} like to care for some one. I knew it wasn't any use. And then this miracle happened.

60|$|He {{slid down}} about two yards, and then {{found that the}} rock {{overhung}} {{so much that he}} was at least six feet off from the crevice in which the young daws nestled comfortably together, and no stretch that he could make with his legs, long though they were, was sufficient to enable him to get on the narrow ledge just below the nest. Several times he tried to gain a footing, and at each effort the juvenile daws--as yet ignorant of the desperate nature of man--opened their little eyes to the utmost in undisguised amazement. For full five minutes Maggot wriggled and the daws gazed, and the anxious comrade above watched the vibrations and jerks of the part of the rope that was visible to him while he listened intently. The bubbles on Zawn Buzzangein, <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> watery eyes, danced and twinkled sixty feet below, as if in wonder at the object which swung wildly to and fro in mid-air.|$|E
50|$|The Commission on Human Security defines human {{security}} as protecting “the vital core {{of all human}} lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfillment.” Major global threats to {{human security}} include war, mass atrocities, environmental degradation, and public health crises. Some human security issues are well known, like torture and genocide, and others are hidden, <b>like</b> the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> missing women in the world. Refugees, the stateless, and {{those who live in}} failed states are often the most vulnerable.|$|R

60|$|SUGAR-LOAF Mountain was hollow inside, for the {{children}} stood facing a great dome that rose so far above their heads that it seemed almost {{as high as the}} sky. And underneath this dome lay spread out the loveliest city imaginable. There were streets of houses, and buildings with round domes, and slender, delicate spires reaching far up into the air, and turrets beautifully ornamented with carvings. And all these were white as the driven snow and sparkling in every part <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> diamonds--for all were built of pure loaf-sugar! The pavements of the streets were also loaf-sugar, and the trees and bushes and flowers were likewise sugar; but these last were not all white, because all sugar is not white, and they showed many bright colors of red sugar and blue sugar and yellow, purple and green sugar, all contrasting most prettily with the sparkling white buildings and the great white dome overhead.|$|E
60|$|This {{elaborate}} remark {{he made to}} Alan {{during the}} progress of a particularly fearful tempest. The lightning blazed in the black sky and seemed to strike all about them like stabbing swords of fire, the thunder crashed and bellowed {{as it may be}} supposed that it will do on that day when the great earth, worn out at last, shall reel and stagger to its doom. The rain fell in a straight and solid sheet; the tall reeds waved confusedly <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dim arms and while they waved, uttered a vast and groaning noise; the scared wildfowl in their terror, with screams and the sough of wings, rushed past them in flocks a thousand strong, now seen and now lost in the vapours. To keep their canoe afloat the poor, naked Ogula oarsmen, shivering with cold and fear, baled furiously with their hands, or bowls of hollowed wood, and called back to Alan to save them as though he were the master of the elements. Even Jeekie was depressed and appeared to be offering up petitions, though whether these were directed to Little Bonsa or elsewhere it was impossible to know.|$|E

5000|$|I don't {{know if it}} was {{the most}} {{downloaded}} film of all time, but there are tracking services that track what movies are being downloaded. And a copy of Hostel 2 leaked out before its release and they had it, it was <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> and <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> hits. Not only was it downloaded, but in the countries it was downloaded - like Mexico and Brazil - there were copies on the street for practically a penny. You could buy Hostel 2 for a quarter in Mexico City. As a result, in a lot of countries where the piracy was bad, they just didn't even release it.|$|R
40|$|In {{a country}} <b>like</b> India, <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> people rely on {{products}} from natural ecosystems {{to sustain their}} livelihood. Natural ecosystems provide clean water from watersheds, retention of soil and soil fertility, sequestration of carbon, as well as pollinators and natural predators of pests. For these reasons, rapid, often irreversible, loss of species and ecosystems is of more than just academic concern. Indeed, our understanding of biodiversity in natural ecosystems remains so woefully inadequate that {{we are unable to}} fully comprehend the consequences of its loss. With impending climate change and increasing spread of invasive species, the biodiversity crisis is likely to get worse, with far-reaching effects on human societies...|$|R
