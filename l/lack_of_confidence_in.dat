The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement {{in the sale of}} the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of soccer (football) {{in the neighborhood}} flourished after the Southwest Houston Soccer Association {{was established in the}} 1990s. Prior to its establishment, a few adult teams existed, but no youth league. In 1995, Silvia Ramirez, a soccer coach, said in a newspaper article that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> English language abilities and long work hours prevented many area residents from creating soccer leagues. The same article quotes citizens who believe that playing soccer prevented them from joining gangs. In 2007, Diana De La Rose, principal of Jane Long Middle School, said that soccer was popular among Gulfton-area students. In 2010 the Houston Dynamo soccer team proposed the construction of a stadium near Gulfton. Instead the BBVA Compass Stadium began construction in East Downtown.|$|E

However, evidence <b>of</b> a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> public <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> science and scientists as effective problem solvers continues to accumulate. This paper speculates that this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> might <b>in</b> part be due {{to the way in which}} science educators present controversial issues. In particular, we argue that current approaches to teaching about controversy do not sufficiently acknowledge the nature of the issues themselves. The paper proposes a set of principles as the basis for a reconceptualization of the teaching of controversial issues and gives an example of how they might be applied in the teaching of one topic...|$|R
5|$|Blamey {{felt he had}} no choice, but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, {{after a series of}} disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him. Despite this outburst, Nani {{was given}} a chance to shine and {{provided}} an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in another good performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was first thought of as a Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel. Following this performance, Nani then set up the second of a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E

40|$|The {{meanings}} {{and functions of}} the Chinese modal particle a and ba in yes-no questions have long been issues debated by scholars of Chinese linguistics and grammar.

Both a-ending and ba-ending questions are confirmation-seeking questions in use, but the former is triggered by things in the speech context that are surprising or arousing a feeling of uncertainty to the speaker; the latter is triggered by the speaker’s <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> total <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> his/her own judgment or inference about a situation, the truth of which he/she does not know. The interrogative function or question force that a or ba can add to a sentence is attributive to the identified inherent modal meanings of the particles and the contexts in which the speaker uses them...|$|R
