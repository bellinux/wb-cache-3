500|$|GameCritics {{praised the}} first part of the loyalty mission, {{comparing}} it favorably to Ocean's Eleven and stating that it is [...] "an unusual and welcome change of pace." [...] VanOrd credited the fact that players can infiltrate Hock's private quarters in two different ways, but also admitted that breaking into Hock's vault [...] "is paced slowly without offering any sense of increasing tension or extended dialogue options to compensate." [...] Nevertheless, he praised Kasumi's ability to silently backstab enemies and the combat scenarios for their enemy variety. The final boss battle was said to be predictable but enjoyable and satisfying. VanOrd concluded that [...] "Stolen Memory" [...] "is still worth a look, but it won't <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> any lasting memories of your own." ...|$|E

Five {{said that they would}} take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said of Manning, [...] "this is a pro quarterback". The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> this thought. If you take me, I promise you we will win a championship. If you don't, I promise I'll come back and kick your ass." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha was {{positive}} in his review. In his opinion, the episode {{never failed to}} deliver and [...] "acts {{as a tribute to}} everything Russell T Davies put in place when he resurrected the series in 2005." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "fast-moving, bursting [...] excitement" [...] and said that it contained [...] "everything you would expect to see from an adventure [...] all companions and a new Dalek empire" [...] and [...] "acts as the ultimate climax to four years of storytelling and will <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> goose bumps for the full 42 minutes." [...] Blair was impressed about how Torchwood and Doctor Who crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it [...] "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband Rhys, Ianto watching The Paul O'Grady Show, and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission. Although his review {{was positive}}, he did criticise two parts of the episode: the concept of [...] "time-lock" [...] the Time War was questioned because the Time Lords were annihilated in the conflict; and he complained that the Doctor's phone number was out of service.|$|E

500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ...

500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E

George Strait matched the feat of 50 number-1 hits in 2002 with his single [...] "She'll <b>Leave</b> <b>You</b> <b>With</b> a Smile" [...] and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single [...] "Wrapped" [...] hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.|$|E

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E
2500|$|His next album, Honkytonkville was {{described}} as [...] "a fiery set of hard country", and was praised [...] "for its mixture of the old Strait with his modern, superstar self." [...] It didn't produce any No.1's for Strait but included the hits [...] "Cowboys Like Us" [...] and a cover of Bruce Robison's [...] "Desperately". His 2004 performance at Reliant Stadium set a new Rodeo attendance record, with 68,679 spectators. That year he issued a Greatest Hits package billed as 50 Number Ones, chronicling the No.1 hits of his career from all charts, starting with [...] "Fool Hearted Memory" [...] and ending with [...] "She'll <b>Leave</b> <b>You</b> <b>With</b> a Smile." [...] A new track, [...] "I Hate Everything", was also included, and became his 51st overall Number One in 2004. The next year, Somewhere Down in Texas arrived, which produced the hit [...] "You'll Be There," [...] marking Strait's first appearance on the Adult Contemporary chart. The next year, he embarked on a tour that included only 18 performances but grossed over $15 million. He attributed this success {{to the fact that}} he and his band are [...] "musically very tight," [...] have a large pool of songs to draw from, and perform those songs very similarly to how they sound on their albums.|$|E
2500|$|A.O. Scott {{writing in}} The New York Times came to believe, [...] "The {{relentless}} {{attention to the}} sheer awfulness of war, which is the film's great strength, is also something of a shortcoming. Mr. Gitai reproduces the numb horror of wading through fields of gore almost too well: the self-protective response is to shut down your emotions, as the characters do. Kippur immerses you in violence and agony, but it may <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> a curious feeling of detachment." [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, felt Kippur was [...] "almost abstract in its portrait of confusion. Long, numbing scenes of soldiers rushing through the war zone with the wounded and returning for more are accompanied by an overwhelming soundtrack of tanks, helicopters and explosions." [...] He also reserved praise for director Gitai, saying he [...] "captures a chaotic portrait of the war with no glory, only the confusion, fear, and fatigue of a tour under fire." [...] Author G.A. of Time Out called the film [...] "impressive" [...] while remarking [...] "Gitai's autobiographically inspired account of the harrowing experiences of a first-aid team {{in the aftermath of}} Syria and Egypt's surprise attack on Israel in October 1973 typically features long, sinuous takes to chart the way in which patriotic enthusiasm is steadily eroded and replaced by fatigue and disillusionment." [...] In a mixed review, Fred Camper writing for the Chicago Reader felt director [...] "Gitai plunges the viewer into the reality of modern warfare, in which the enemy is often invisible – we never see the Syrians in Kippur – and battle lines are often unclear." [...] Jack Mathews writing for the NY Daily News, believed that instead of [...] "heightening our sense of empathy, we become numbed by the repetition" [...] of the film.|$|E
