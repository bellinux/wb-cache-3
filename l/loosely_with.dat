5|$|I-87 {{begins in}} the Bronx at the {{northern}} approach to the Triborough Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> the Harlem River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring {{a change in the}} nearby river's course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and U.S. Route1 or US1) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in close proximity to the Harlem River until the waterway turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> life on the road as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Thomas Fletcher paid {{contractors}} {{to build a}} reservoir on his land, intending that it should supply the Ainsworth Mill with water. Fletcher played no {{active role in the}} construction, instead contracting out to a competent engineer. While building it, the contractors discovered a series of old coal shafts and passages under the land filled <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> soil and debris, which joined up with John Rylands's adjoining mine. Rather than blocking these shafts up, the contractors left them. On 11 December 1860, shortly after being filled for the first time, Fletcher's reservoir burst and flooded Rylands's mine, the Red House Colliery, causing £937 worth of damage. Fletcher pumped the water out, but on 17 April 1861 his pump burst, and the mine again began to flood. At this point a mines inspector was brought in, and the sunken coal shafts were discovered. Rylands and the owner, Jehu Horrocks, brought a claim against Fletcher on 4 November 1861.|$|E

2500|$|The {{content of}} the two recensions differ from each other considerably, {{although}} the method is the same in both. The separate sentences of the Mishnah Avot are generally taken as texts, which are either briefly explained—the ethical lessons contained therein being supported by reference to Biblical passages—or fully illustrated by narratives and legends. Sometimes long digressions are made by introducing subjects connected only <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> the text. This method may be illustrated by the following example: Commenting on the sentence of Simon the Just, in Pirkei Avot, i. 2, which designates charity {{as one of the}} three pillars on which the world rests, the Avot de-Rabbi Nathan (recension A) reads as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mauritian tomb bat {{is often}} found in groups of around five individuals. These groups are usually either made up of entirely male or female individuals; when they are found in mixed gender groups, the two sexes are {{separated}} by at least 100mm. [...] Females live together in groups of three to thirty, while males live alone except during the mating season. Unlike some species of bats, they do not roost close together in tight packs; instead they are found spaced out <b>loosely,</b> <b>with</b> {{the exception of a}} mother and her offspring. There are places where groups of at least a hundred bats have been found, one example being the Shai Hills Resource Reserve in Ghana.|$|E
2500|$|The y-axis {{of a mass}} {{spectrum}} represents signal intensity of the ions. [...] When using counting detectors the intensity is often measured in counts per second (cps). [...] When using analog detection electronics the intensity is typically measured in volts. [...] In FTICR and Orbitraps the frequency domain signal (the y-axis) {{is related to the}} power (~amplitude squared) of the signal sine wave (often reduced to an rms power); however, the axis is usually not labeled as such for many reasons. [...] In most forms of mass spectrometry, the intensity of ion current measured by the spectrometer does not accurately represent relative abundance, but correlates <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> it. Therefore, it is common to label the y-axis with [...] "arbitrary units".|$|E

2500|$|Ironside's {{enthusiasm for}} [...] "peripheral" [...] {{operations}} {{led him to}} plans for Allied intervention in Scandinavia; rather than the limited approach of simply mining Norwegian waters to stop Swedish iron-ore shipments to Germany, he argued for landing a strong force in northern Norway and physically occupying the Swedish orefields. If successful, this would allow the resupply of Finland – then fighting the Soviet Union, and aligned <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> the Allied forces – as well as interdicting Germany's ore supply, and could potentially force Germany to commit troops on a new and geographically unfavourable front. Both Ironside and Churchill supported the plan enthusiastically, but it met with opposition from many other officers, including from Gort – who saw his forces in France being depleted of resources – and from Newall, the Chief of the Air Staff.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike modern genetic {{analyses}}, ancient DNA {{studies are}} characterised by low-quality DNA. This {{places limits on}} what analyses can achieve. Furthermore, due to degradation of the DNA molecules, a process which correlates <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> factors such as time, temperature, and presence of free water, upper limits exist beyond which no DNA is deemed likely to survive. Allentoft et al. (2012) tried to calculate this limit by studying the decay of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in Moa bones. The DNA degrades in an exponential decay process. According to their model, mitochondrial DNA is degraded to an average length of 1 base pair after 6,830,000 years at −5°C. [...] The decay kinetics have been measured by accelerated aging experiments further displaying the strong influence of storage temperature and humidity on DNA decay. Nuclear DNA degrades {{at least twice as}} fast as mtDNA. As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from Cretaceous dinosaur remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.|$|E

6000|$|One afternoon, as Mary sat in {{her window}} reading, a gay voice exclaimed, 'Beso las manos a Usted;' and looking up, she {{saw one of the}} prettiest figures imaginable. A full dark purple satin skirt just {{revealed}} the point of a dainty white satin shoe. It was plaited low on the hips, and girded <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> a brightly striped scarf. The head and upper part of the person were shrouded in a close hood of elastic black silk webbing, fastened behind at the waist, and held over the face by the hand, which just allowed one be-ringed finger and one glancing dark eye to appear, while the other hand held a fan and a laced pocket-handkerchief. So perfectly did the costume suit the air and shape of the lady, that, as she stood among Mary's orange trees, it was like an illusion, of the fancy, but consternation took away all the charm from Mary's eyes. 'Tapada, she cried; 'you surely are not going out, tapada?' ...|$|E

Put on a wash of color, {{prepared}} very pale, quite flat over all of it, except the highest light, leaving the edge of your color quite sharp. Then another wash, extending only over the darker parts, leaving the edge of that sharp also, as in tinting the square. Then another wash over the still darker parts, and another over the darkest, leaving each edge to dry sharp. Then, with the small touches, efface the edges, reinforce the darks, and work the whole delicately together as you would with the pen, till you have got it to the likeness of the true light and shade. You will find that the tint underneath is a great help, and that you can now get effects much more subtle and complete than with the pen merely.|$|E

"Queen's Majesty {{was already}} {{altogether}} dressed," [...] says Geusau, {{almost as if}} with some disappointment; [...] "all in black; a most affable courteous Majesty; stands conversing with the Russian Ambassador, with the Dutch ditto, with the Ladies about her, and at last, 'in a friendly and merry tone,' with old Cardinal Fleury.

Poor little souls, they are the LOQUE, the COCHON (Rag, Pig, so Papa would call them, dear Papa), who become tragically visible again in the Revolution time:--all blooming young children as yet (Queen's Majesty some thirty-seven gone), and little dreaming what lies fifty years ahead! King Louis's career of extraneous gallantries, which ended in the Parc-aux-Cerfs, is now just beginning: think of that too; and of her Majesty's fine behavior under it; so affable, so patient, silent, now and always!--"In a little while, their Majesties go along the Great Gallery to Chapel;" [...] whither the Protestant mind cannot with comfort accompany.

60|$|It {{is easier}} to {{discover}} another such a new world as Columbus did, than to go within one fold of this which we appear to know so well; the land is lost sight of, the compass varies, and mankind mutiny; and still history accumulates like rubbish before the portals of nature. But there is only necessary a moment's sanity and sound senses, to teach {{us that there is}} a nature behind the ordinary, in which we have only some vague pre-emption right and western reserve as yet. We live on the outskirts of that region. Carved wood, and floating boughs, and sunset skies, are all that we know of it. We are not to be imposed on by the longest spell of weather. Let us not, my friends, be wheedled and cheated into good behavior to earn the salt of our eternal porridge, whoever they are that attempt it. Let us wait a little, and not purchase any clearing here, trusting that richer bottoms will soon be put up. It is but thin soil where we stand; I have felt my roots in a richer ere this.

60|$|The gorge, at this point, {{was some}} fifteen yards wide. The {{barricade}} across it was thirty feet in height. It was formed of blocks of stone, of various sizes; intermingled with which were sharp stakes, with their points projecting; lines of bushes and arms of trees, piled outwards; {{and the whole}} was covered <b>loosely</b> <b>with</b> sharp prickly creepers, cut from the trees and heaped there. A more difficult place to climb, even without its being defended from above, {{would be difficult to}} find. The covering of thorny creepers hid the rocks below; and at each step the soldiers put their feet into deep holes between the masses of rock, and fell forward, lacerating themselves horribly with the thorns, or coming face downwards on one of the sharp-pointed stakes. But if, without any resistance from above, the feat of climbing this carefully prepared barricade was difficult; it was terrible when, from the ridge above, a storm of bullets swept down. It was only for a moment that the negroes exposed themselves, in the act of firing. Behind, the barricade was as level and smooth as it was difficult upon the outer side. Great steps, some three feet wide, had been prepared of wood; so that the defenders could easily mount and, standing in lines, relieve each other as they fired. The stones of the top series had been carefully chosen of a form so as to leave, between each, crevices through which the defenders could fire, while scarcely exposing themselves to the enemy.|$|E
