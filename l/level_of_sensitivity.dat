25|$|Addressable {{systems are}} usually more {{expensive}} than conventional non-addressable systems, and offer extra options, including a custom <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (sometimes called Day/Night mode) which can {{determine the amount of}} smoke in a given area and contamination detection from the FACP that allows determination {{of a wide range of}} faults in detection capabilities of smoke detectors. Detectors become contaminated usually as a result of the build up of atmospheric particulates in the detectors being circulated by the heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Other causes include carpentry, sanding, painting, and smoke in the event of a fire. Panels can also be interconnected to monitor a very large number of detectors in multiple buildings. This is most commonly used in hospitals, universities, resorts and other large centres or institutions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} clades of Symbiodinium phylotypes. Most {{research}} has been completed on the Symbiodinium clades A–D. Each {{one of the eight}} contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts. Each photosynthetic organism has a specific <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to photodamage of compounds needed for survival, such as proteins. Rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism's ability to survive. Phylotype A is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters. It is able to produce mycosporine-like amino acids that are UV resistant, using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the UV radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures. In the event of UV or thermal damage, if and when repair occurs, it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont. This leads to the idea that, evolutionarily, clade A is more UV resistant and thermally resistant than the other clades.|$|E

25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E

[...] Men saw them as highly eroticised due to their profession, {{but at the same time}} unattainable, since only the wealthiest, most cultured men would have any chance of sexual relations with one. [...] Women saw them as distant, glamorous idols, and the fashions for the whole of Japan were inspired by the fashions of the courtesan. [...] For these reasons the fetish of the courtesan appealed to many.|$|E
2500|$|Other authors {{suggest that}} the {{butterfly}} effect {{can be observed in}} quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different Hamiltonians. They investigate the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians. Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which [...] "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics". They consider fidelity decay to be [...] "the closest quantum analog to the (purely classical) butterfly effect". Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated experimentally. Quantum and semiclassical treatments of system sensitivity to initial conditions are known as quantum chaos.|$|E

Far from being a one-off experiment, these are actually the characteristics to the album and like Blink-182 before going on hiatus, New Found Glory have allowed their music to mature." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London, gave the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "utterly engaging". While mentioning standout tracks, he added, [...] "The low-key [...] "Make Your Move" [...] drops some beautifully cascading riffs, while, the chiming piano chords that open [...] "It’s Not Your Fault" [...] give way into an effortlessly inspiring song." [...] People magazine declared that Coming Home is [...] "their best album yet", while Dan Aquilante of The New York Post awarded a score of three stars out of four and wrote that the album is [...] "a smart, stylistic mix rich in vocal harmonies, it's driven by guitar and piano breaks.

It's everything New Found Glory have been leading to all this time; and it's everything we never knew they had in them. Absolutely stunning." [...] Florida-based newspaper, The Palm Beach Post were also highly favorable and graded the album as an [...] "A-". They wrote, [...] "It's all written in beautifully vulnerable, snarkless, shout-it-out-loud terms, with an unself-conscious joy in the lyrics, the do-do-dos and the muted hand claps that find a sweet, genuine current of emotion without sacrificing edge. Pundik's delivery is never cloying, ironic or dumb. Underscored by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's strong beat, the songs are like a pre-made mix tape about {{the ups and downs of}} making yourself honestly vulnerable to another human being. Bravo." [...] Rock Sound journalist Tim Newbound rated the album at nine out of ten and particularly praised the band's progression. Writing that, [...] "New Found Glory have come of age. Their punchy punk-pop styling of old may have temporarily waned, but their knack of writing inducing melodies amid sincere delivery has only intensified. Pundik's nasal-edged vocals have now blossomed into a fuller pitch, perfectly complimenting his band's more tuneful and matured musicianship. Top notch." ...|$|E

A group based trajectory analysis <b>of</b> parental <b>sensitivity</b> obtained from separate observations of father-child and mother-child interaction across a seven year study period revealed four distinct, yet similar, trajectories of fathers' and mothers' sensitivity. These included groups defined by high-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-decreasing, and low-increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The majority <b>of</b> fathers and mothers in this sample exhibited high to moderately stable <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with their children during early and middle childhood.
