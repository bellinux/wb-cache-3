40|$|The common jollytail, Galaxias maculates, is a {{normally}} diadromous {{fish with}} a distribution spanning Australia, New Zealand, South America and associated islands. In this species, as {{in several other}} diadromous galaxiids, the marine larval stage is not obligatory and <b>landlocking</b> and <b>landlocking</b> often occurs {{as a consequence of}} the 2 ̆ 7 loss of diadromy 2 ̆ 7. Reproductive isolation accompanies <b>landlocking</b> of a population, and consequently facilities local adaption and the accumulation of genetic differences between populations. The Western District Lakes of Victoria (internationally recognised under the RAMSAR wetlands convention) are home to landlocked populations of G. maculatus. Present threats to G. maculatus in these lakes are habitat loss and/or degradation, predation from introduced salmonids, and translocation. Populations of landlocked and diadromous G. maculatus from western Victoria have been studied using molecular genetic methods to determine the extent of genetic differentiation between these two life-history forms...|$|E
40|$|Non-profit {{organizations}} are increasingly {{subjected to the}} forces of globalization. Although this should not come as a surprise, it is curious {{to note that the}} taxation of international philanthropy is an area where discrimination as to residence is still very obvious. Whereas domestic philanthropic flows of money enjoy substantial tax privileges throughout the democratic western world, these privileges often do not apply in situations where borders are crossed. In recent years the importance of support from charities and social investments has increased substantially, but cross-border philanthropy still remains hampered by numerous tax issues. By comparing the relevant legal and tax systems in selected countries, and by taking into account other legal developments relevant to international philanthropy, the author attempts to find a common approach to solve the tax obstacles of international philanthropy. The book begins by defining the scope of the study including the concept of 'landlock', political philosophies substantiating tax relief for philanthropic organizations and an analysis of bilateral treaties. This is followed by a comprehensive and comparative overview of the approach taken in three legal and tax systems regarding international philanthropy, i. e. Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. The work also examines whether EU law allows states (within and without the EU) to maintain 'landlocked' tax positions and, if so, under what type of conditions this may be permitted. Finally, the book concludes with a proposal of a new paradigm of non-discriminating treatment of philanthropy by examining ways to abolish <b>landlocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|This publication, a {{joint effort}} of the European Foundation Centre (EFC) and Transnational Giving Europe (TGE), offers {{recommendations}} and ideas which could potentially ease tax-effective cross-border philanthropy in Europe. Tax experts from across Europe contributed to this publication. Cross-border philanthropy in Europe is growing. Philanthropic organisations are both investing more across national boundaries {{as part of their}} asset management strategy, and individual and corporate donors are increasing their philanthropic giving outside of their home countries. But the fiscal environment for cross-border philanthropy, even within the European Union, is still far from satisfactory. Although the EU's non-discrimination principle, which applies to philanthropy, some legislators and authorities still discriminate against comparable foreign EU-based philanthropic players. And processes to gain equal treatment - where they are indeed available - are burdensome, lengthy and costly. This paper aims to highlight good and bad existing practice and to develop recommendations and ideas which could potentially lead to a simplification of the procedures for implementation of the non-discrimination principle. This is therefore not an academic paper but rather a practitioner-driven view on the matter, which will need to be further developed and discussed with fiscal experts and policymakers in the field of philanthropy taxation. The paper is hence a recommended read for legislators and authorities, as well as for philanthropists and the wider non-profit sector. The analysis and recommendations contained in this publication follow on from a study released in 2014 bythe EFC and the Transnational Giving Europe network (TGE), "Taxation of cross-border philanthropy in Europe after Persche and Stauffer - From <b>landlock</b> to free movement?"...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the effects of individual acclimation and population divergence on salinity preference. Full-sibling families of marine, anadromous, and freshwater-landlocked populations of stickleback were reared in common environments until 3 weeks post-hatch, then were split and acclimated to low or high salinity. At 6 to 8 weeks of age the six experimental groups were tested for salinity preference in a tank that offers fish a choice of compartments with different salinities arranged in a gradient from fresh to sea water. We observed significant population and acclimation effects. Anadromous fish preferred sea water and avoided fresh water, whether acclimated to low or high salinity. Landlocked fish showed a strong acclimation effect, avoiding salt water when acclimated to fresh and avoiding freshwater when acclimated to salt, while showing no preference for their acclimation salinity. Fish from the marine population showed little preference for fresh or sea water regardless of acclimation salinity. After restriction to fresh water for more than five thousand generations, landlocked fish have evolved weaker preferences in response to a salinity gradient compared to their anadromous ancestors...|$|E
40|$|New and {{published}} data have been collated for the biology {{and distribution of}} atherinid species abundant in the coastal saline waters of Australia below 30 °S. This information {{has been used to}} determine whether these species typically spawn at sea or pass through the whole of their life cycle in estuaries, and in one case, also lagoons and saline lakes. Length-frequency data, gonadosomatic indices and distribution records indicate that in south-eastern Australia Craterocephalus honoriae and Atherinosoma microstoma typically reach total lengths less than 90 mm, have a one-year life cycle and breed within estuaries. This parallels the situation recently described for Atherinosoma elongata, Atherinosoma wallacei and Allanetta mugiloides in south-western Australia (Prince et al., 1982 a; Prince & Potter, 1983). The marine species Atherinosoma presbyteroides, which reaches a similar size and has a one year life cycle in both south-western and south-eastern mainland Australia, only enters estuaries in large numbers in the former region. While Atherinomorus ogilbyi is also found in estuaries and typically breeds at sea, it reaches total lengths as great as 189 mm and has a longer life than A. presbyteroides. The limited data for Atherinason esox and Atherinason hepsetoides demonstrate that both these marine atherinids can attain total lengths of 139 and 108 mm respectively and live for longer than a year but do not enter estuaries in large numbers. The latter species is unique amongst southern Australian atherinids in having a distribution which extends into deeper water. It is suggested that <b>landlocking</b> may {{have played a role in}} the evolution and success of the estuarine mode of life sensu stricto of A. wallacei, A. elongata, A. microstoma, A. honoriae and A. mugiloides in southern Australian waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from seawater to freshwater is {{deeply rooted in}} the evolutionary history of animals, initiating the radiation and speciation of many taxa. However, crossing the boundary into freshwater from the sea represents a considerable physiological challenge for animals that maintain a near constant internal ion concentration. Because seawater and freshwater differ strongly in solute concentration, the transition into freshwater must involve the evolution of ion and water balance; yet, we have a limited understanding of the physiological modifications that facilitate this transition. Here, I investigate the evolution of the osmoregulatory system upon transition to freshwater using populations of an ancestrally anadromous fish, the Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), which has become landlocked on multiple, independent occasions. I take an integrative approach, exploring the molecular, physiological, and whole-organism level consequences of the freshwater transition. Overall, my dissertation demonstrates that the transition to freshwater in the Alewife leads to evolutionary shifts in osmoregulatory capacity, which may be driven by changes in the mechanisms of ion exchange at the gill. In chapter 2, I show that <b>landlocking</b> leads to the partial loss of seawater tolerance and hypoosmoregulatory performance, which may be mediated through reductions in expression and activity of genes for gill ion secretion. Chapter 3 demonstrates that several independently derived landlocked populations vary in the degree of seawater tolerance loss, and that this variation is negatively correlated with freshwater tolerance. This suggests that trade-offs in osmoregulation follow local adaptation to freshwater. In chapter 4, I use next generation sequencing to show that thousands of genes have differentiated in expression between Alewife life history forms. Comparison of gill transcriptomes of anadromous and landlocked Alewives reveals that changes in the regulation of transcription of genes in gill ion exchange pathways may underlie evolutionary changes in osmoregulation. In chapter 5, I demonstrate that landlocked Alewives are poor swimmers compared to anadromous Alewives, and that differences in swimming ability are not explained by differences in osmoregulatory performance or body shape. These results suggest that reductions in swimming performance among landlocked Alewives may be a function of relaxed selection on migration capacity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} how the characteristics of the ichthyofauna of the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary on the south coast of Western Australia are influenced by the exceptionally high salinities attained during protracted periods of <b>landlocking</b> and, at other times, by atypically heavy freshwater discharge and consequently the opening of the estuary mouth. After 47 months of continuous closure, this estuary became open to the sea for 30 days in September/October 1997 and then closed again for a further six months. Nearshore, shallow and offshore, deeper waters of the lower, middle and upper regions of this estuary were sampled using seine and gill nets, respectively, in alternate months between July 1996 and May 1998. Mean monthly salinities in each region were > 40 on all sampling occasions, except immediately preceding and following the opening of the estuary mouth and, in the lower estuary, they rose to a maximum of 112 in March 1997, before declining to a minimum of 14 in September 1997. The fish fauna of Wellstead Estuary was highly depauperate (20 species), presumably due mainly to the very limited opportunities for the immigration of marine species. However, appreciable numbers of two marine species (Mugil cephalus and Aldrichetta forsteri) entered from the sea when the estuary was open in the period prior to October 1993 and were able to survive in the highly variable salinities found in this estuary when it was landlocked for the following 47 months. There was strong evidence that, as salinities rose to very high levels in 1997, all of the Leptatherina wallacei and Amoya bifrenatus found in the estuary died and some other species moved from the lower to upper reaches of the estuary where salinities did not rise to such high levels. The atherinid Atherinosoma elongata was the only species caught in March 1997 at the site in the lower estuary where the salinity reached 122. Subsequently, the number of species and overall density of fish in the lower estuary, and particularly in nearshore, shallow waters, increased markedly, presumably due to the downstream flushing effects of heavy freshwater discharge and a decline in salinity. When the bar was breached, small numbers of certain marine species, e. g. Sardinops neopilchardus, Sillaginodes punctata, Arripis georgiana, Arripis truttaceus and Pomatomus saltatrix, entered from the sea, while some individuals of M. cephalus and A. forsteri emigrated from the estuary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The dynamic {{geological}} and climatic {{histories of}} temperate South America have played {{important roles in}} shaping the contemporary distributions and genetic diversity of endemic freshwater species. We use mitochondria and nuclear sequence variation to investigate the consequences of mountain barriers and Quaternary glacial cycles for patterns of genetic diversity in the diadromous fish Galaxias maculatus in Patagonia (~ 300 individuals from 36 locations). Results Contemporary populations of G. maculatus, east and west of the Andes in Patagonia, represent a single monophyletic lineage comprising several well supported groups. Mantel tests using control region data revealed a strong positive relationship when geographic distance was modeled according to a scenario of marine dispersal. (r = 0. 69, P = 0. 055). By contrast, direct distance between regions was poorly correlated with genetic distance (r = - 0. 05, P = 0. 463). Hierarchical AMOVAs using mtDNA revealed that pooling samples according to historical (pre-LGM) oceanic drainage (Pacific vs. Atlantic) explained approximately four times more variance than pooling them into present-day drainage (15. 6 % vs. 3. 7 %). Further post-hoc AMOVA tests revealed additional genetic structure between populations east and west of the Chilean Coastal Cordillera (coastal vs. interior). Overall female effective population size appears to have remained relatively constant until roughly 0. 5 Ma when population size rapidly increased several orders of magnitude [100 × (60 ×- 190 ×) ] to reach contemporary levels. Maximum likelihood analysis of nuclear alleles revealed a poorly supported gene tree which was paraphyletic with respect to mitochondrial-defined haplogroups. Conclusions First diversifying in the central/north-west region of Patagonia, G. maculatus extended its range into Argentina via the southern coastal regions that join the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. More recent gene flow between northern populations involved the most ancient and most derived lineages, and was likely facilitated by drainage reversal(s) during one or more cooling events of the late Pleistocene. Overall female effective population size represents {{the end result of}} a widespread and several hundred-fold increase over approximately 0. 5 Ma, spanning several climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene. The minor influence of glacial cycles on the genetic structure and diversity of G. maculatus likely reflects the access to marine refugia during repeated bouts of global cooling. Evidence of genetic structure that was detected on a finer scale between lakes/rivers is most likely the result of both biological attributes (i. e., resident non-migratory behavior and/or <b>landlocking</b> and natal homing in diadromous populations), and the Coastal Cordillera as a dispersal barrier. </p...|$|E
