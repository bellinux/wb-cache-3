On the other hand, centres of <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> the Platonic Academy in Athens {{and the famous}} Law School of Beirut lost their importance during his reign. Despite Justinian's passion for the glorious Roman past, the practice of choosing Roman consul was allowed to lapse after 541.|$|E

General topics discussed in the work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics {{in the field of}} psychology include clinical psychology, cognition, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology, gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons. McCarthy cites Bart's passive-avoidance <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> a risk factor, and notes that Maggie is at a high risk for substance abuse due to violent tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Urban elites {{throughout}} the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals (paideia). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher <b>learning</b> <b>as</b> {{an expression of}} cultural achievement. Young men from Rome who wished to pursue {{the highest levels of}} education often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and numeracy. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair of grammar. In the eastern empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and aesthetic values, and the Greek proclivities for which Nero had been criticized were regarded from the time of Hadrian onward as integral to Imperial culture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The European {{framework}} for “Key Competences for Lifelong Learning ” the term “mathematical competence ” means {{the ability to}} develop and apply mathematical thinking in order to solve a range of problems in everyday life. In this context, the way prospective teachers perceive mathematics learning becomes significant. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify prospective mathematics teachers’ metaphorical images with respect to the concept of “mathematics learning ” using metaphor techniques. The prospective teachers who participated in the research (a total of 59) included 35 females and 24 males. The participants were asked to formulate metaphors about “mathematics learning”. The metaphors and their justifications were analyzed and eight conceptual categories were determined. For reliability of the research study, expert opinion was sought to confirm whether the metaphorical images given under 8 categories represented one of those conceptual categories. The conceptual categories are <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> eternity, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> playing games, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> to learn-puzzle, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> life, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> art, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> to live-necessity, <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> mind and <b>learning</b> mathematics <b>as</b> love...|$|R
