At iwb has been built a complete production line {{with the purpose of}} improving all the stages, including the filling and the following wetting of the cells. Because of the barely existence of a wetting measurement method in the literature, a method was already proposed in a former work. The system was composed of a vacuum chamber, a case to hold the cell’s layers that were pressed with a Plexiglas block, a <b>liquid</b> <b>circuit,</b> and a camera to record the phenomena. This master thesis has contributed to improve the method, redesigning the setup, and creating a completely new video analysis. A statistical model with four main factors has been formulated. These describe a pressure profile using as variables a filling and a wetting pressure, a held time, and the number of cycles this is repeated. The chosen response is the percentage that the electrolyte has soaked at the end on the process. The study is performed to provide guidance on the trends of the response.

40|$|Liquid {{sprays of}} water are {{frequently}} used in {{air pollution control}} for gas cooling purposes and for gas cleaning. Twin-fluid nozzles with internal mixing are often used for these purposes {{because of the small}} size of the drops produced. In these nozzles the liquid is dispersed by compressed air or another pressurized gas. In high efficiency scrubbers for particle separation, several nozzles are operated in parallel because {{of the size of the}} cross section. In such scrubbers, the scrubbing water has to be re-circulated. Precipitation of some solid material can occur in the <b>liquid</b> <b>circuit,</b> caused by chemical reactions. When such precipitations are detached from the place of formation, they can partly or totally block the liquid flow to a nozzle. Due to the resulting unbalanced supply of the nozzles with water and gas, the efficiency of separation decreases. Thus, the nozzles have to be cleaned if a certain fraction of blockages is reached. The aim of this study was to provide a tool for continuously monitoring the status of the nozzles of a scrubber based on the available operation data (water flow, air flow, water pressure and air pressure). The difference between the air pressure and the water pressure is not well suited for this purpose, because the difference is quite small and therefore very exact calibration of the pressure measurement would be required. Therefore, an equation for the reference air flow of a nozzle at the actual water flow and operation pressure was derived. This flow can be compared with the actual air flow for assessment of the status of the nozzles...|$|E

The electricity increase is 6 kWh of energy. In the summer, the energy savings are 17 to 38 kWh, with the electricity increase 8 kWh of energy. The second VS, i. e. system combining ventilation a solar systems, the calculation was carried out in TRNSYS computer program for two objects - a “low-energy house” (LEH) and “two-floor house” (TFH) - and 6 different solar systems modifications. The energy gains at the LEH for the 3 solar modif. are 49, 59 and 46 kWh per year (yearly consumption for heating is 2622 kWh). The energy gains at the TFH for the 3 solar modif. are 86, 134 and 129 kWh (yearly consumption for the heating is 8988 kWh). The third VS is a residential VS with <b>liquid</b> <b>circuit</b> with two compact “heat exchangers” (HE) at the inlet and outlet air. The results shows (compared to VS without heat recovery) that with the air flow volume 150 m 3 /h the energy savings in the winter are 1761 - 3148 kWh (16 -hour and 24 -hour operation mode). The electr. increase is 173 to 262 kWh of energy. In the exp. research the measuring section for the HE measuring was built. Then the conventional materials HE was measured.

40|$|Gallium-based liquid metals have {{recently}} been found important {{in a variety of}} newly emerging applications such as room temperature metal 3 D printing, direct writing of electronics and biomedicine etc. In all these practices, one frequently encounters the situations that a printed circuit or track needs to be corrected or the unwanted parts of the device should be removed as desired.

Here we have identified several low cost ways toward this goal by comparatively investigating three typical strategies spanning from mechanical, chemical, to electrochemical principles, for removing the gallium-based <b>liquid</b> metal <b>circuits</b> or thin films. Regarding the mechanical approach, we constructed an eraser for removing the liquid metal thin films.

They are used typically either for measuring flow-rate or to introduce a pressure drop for purposes of flow balancing. The present study focuses on the latter application. It is widely acknowledged in literature, that the turbulent, unsteady nature of the flow issuing through an orifice {{can also be a}} source of structural vibration. In order {{to understand the nature of}} the vibration source, the present experimental investigations analyze the time-varying flow field by means of unsteady wall-pressure measurements and time resolved, planar, particle-image-velocimetry (PIV). In addition to understanding the dynamics of the flow through a single-hole orifice, this study has assessed the possibility of using multiple-hole orifices as an alternative. It is observed that the overall magnitude and extent of the disturbance levels in the flow are reduced with the multiple-hole orifices, while maintaining similar levels of pressure drop. It is hypothesized that these lower disturbances are a result of the small-scale flow structures associated with the multiple-hole orifice flow (multiple jets as opposed to one). The measurements give detailed insights into the flow behavior downstream of orifice plates. Results indicate a low frequency flapping motion of the single-hole orifice jet, which is sustained by the surrounding large recirculation regions. For the geometries of the sharp-edged single-hole orifices investigated, the flapping frequency was observed to increase with flow speed and is found to occur at a Strouhal number = 0. 02 based on the orifice jet velocity and the difference in internal diameters of the pipe and orifice.

Large torsional muscle stroke (53 °/mm) with minor hysteresis loop was obtained for a low applied voltage (5 V) {{without the use}} of a relatively complex three-electrode electromechanical setup, liquid electrolyte, or packaging. Useful tensile muscle strokes were obtained (1. 3 % at 2. 5 V and 0. 52 % at 1 V) when lifting loads that are 25 times heavier than can be lifted by the same diameter human skeletal muscle. Also, the tensile actuator maintained its contraction following charging and subsequent disconnection from the power supply because of its own supercapacitor property at the same time. Possible eventual applications for the individual tensile and torsional muscles are in micromechanical devices, such as for controlling valves and stirring <b>liquids</b> in microfluidic <b>circuits,</b> and in medical catheters...|$|R
