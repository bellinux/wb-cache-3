50|$|Stadium {{spot lights}} are energy {{efficient}} and their superior brightness illuminates {{a large area}} of water. Rated at 250, 400, 1000 and 1500 watts, the high intensity discharge <b>lamp,</b> parabola-shaped reflector <b>and</b> light ballast are each sold separately. A complete <b>light</b> <b>fixture</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamp</b> costs about $400-$500. The cost of lamps with different wattage ratings are similar, so most people chose higher wattage lamps. The bulbs in these lamps can emit white, blue-green, green or yellow light. For most fishing waters the lamp color of choice is green. They are available through specialty light stores. It takes two people to install these big <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> the installation may also include a switch, timer, heavy gauge wiring and circuit breaker, thus adding to the cost.|$|R

50|$|Blown glass {{has been}} an {{important}} industry in the state since the early 20th century, especially in Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. Initially, it was developed to make bottles for the tequila industry. Since then, it has developed into the making of various utilitarian and decorative objects, using a variety of techniques. Traditional colors for glass pieces include cobalt blue, amethyst and green. Blown glass remains true to traditional forms as well as division of labor, with workshops having apprentices and workers under a master craftsman. However more modern setups have come into play since the mid 20th century, when Jose Camarasa began to manufacture glass prisms for <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamps</b> in Tlaquepaque. He also makes ornamental and utilitarian pieces of lead crystal, with the red pieces particularly prized. Metals include iron, gold, tin, copper, and silver to make fine and everyday objects. Tin is worked from sheets to make decorative objects such as mirror frames and Christmas decorations. Wrought iron is principally worked in Guadalajara, and in Sayuda where they make knives, blades and machetes and is home to the Knife Museum. Silver is worked into jewelry (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc.) in Guadalajara, which is one of Mexico’s main centers for this work. Pewter is worked into bowls, plates, frames and more.|$|R

There {{are several}} large {{rectangular}} tables with chairs {{in the center of}} the room, a row of chairs along either wall and in the corner of the far wall, set in front of the large arched French doors. A white fireplace is at the end of the room, and three elaborate chandeliers, suspended from ceiling fans hang above the tables, separated by the large wooden cross beams on the ceiling. <b>Light</b> <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> electric <b>lamps</b> are along either wall. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
50|$|A new {{sign was}} {{purchased}} and erected, extensive electrical rewiring, installation of ceiling fans, <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> sanctuary <b>lamps,</b> {{as well as}} electrical outlets were also installed. A new chalice, crystal cruets and a new paten were purchased. Old shrubbery has been removed and new flowers planted. Painting on both the inside and outside was also done. St. Olaf’s has even participated in its first Pictorial Directory. Occasionally potluck suppers are held after the Saturday evening worship service at member’s homes. During the Christmas season a potluck is held at St. Olaf’s after the decorations are put in place. Good food and good fellowship can always be found.|$|R

50|$|Fresnels use a spherical reflector, {{with the}} {{filament}} of the lamp at the focus {{point of the}} reflector. The reflector effectively doubles the light output of the <b>fixture,</b> as all <b>light</b> that is emitted backwards into the reflector is reflected back through the filament of the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> out the front. As with most <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures,</b> the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> reflector cannot move independently, and remain a fixed unit inside the housing. It is this unit that is moved back and forth inside the lamp to focus the light. This is done by a slider {{on the bottom of}} the lantern, or by a worm track with a crank in the back of the unit. The lamps are almost always mounted 'base down', i.e. with the bulb standing upwards. Burning these lamps upside down will shorten lamp life significantly.|$|R

Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|R
