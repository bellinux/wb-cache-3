40|$|The {{high time}} {{resolution}} observations {{obtained by the}} WAVES experiment of the STEREO spacecraft in solar type III radio bursts show that Langmuir waves often occur as intense localized wave packets. These wave packets are characterized by short durations {{of only a few}} ms and peak intensities, which well exceed the supersonic modulational instability (MI) thresholds. These timescales and peak intensities satisfy the criterion of the solitons collapsed to spatial scales of a few hundred Debye lengths. The spectra of these wave packets consist of primary spectral peaks corresponding to beam-resonant Langmuir waves, two or more sidebands corresponding to down-shifted and up-shifted daughter Langmuir waves, and <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>enhancements</b> below a few hundred Hz corresponding to daughter ion sound waves. The frequencies and wave numbers of these spectral components satisfy the resonance conditions of the modulational instability (MI). Moreover, the tricoherences, computed using trispectral analysis techniques show that these spectral components are coupled to each other {{with a high degree of}} coherency as expected of the MI type of four wave interactions. The high intensities, short scale lengths, sideband spectral structures and <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral <b>enhancements</b> and, high levels of tricoherences amongst the spectral components of these wave packets provide unambiguous evidence for the supersonic MI and related strong turbulence processes in type III radio bursts. The implication of these observations include: (1) the MI and related strong turbulence processes often occur in type III source regions, (2) the strong turbulence processes probably play very important roles in beam stabilization as well as conversion of Langmuir waves into escaping radiation at the fundamental and second harmonic of the electron plasma frequency, fpe, and (3) the Langmuir collapse probably follows the route of MI in type III radio bursts...|$|R

While serviceable, EL speech is plagued by shortcomings in both quality and intelligibility.

EL speech tokens that were enhanced using combinations of three different improvements, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>enhancement,</b> self-noise reduction, and added pitch information were presented in pairs to a group of ten listeners.

40|$|The four wave {{interaction}} process, {{known as}} the oscillating two stream instability (OTSI) is considered {{as one of the}} mechanisms responsible for stabilizing the electron beams associated with solar type III radio bursts. It has been reported that (1) an intense localized Langmuir wave packet associated with a type III burst contains the spectral characteristics of the OTSI: (a) a resonant peak at the local electron plasma frequency, f(sub pe), (b) a Stokes peak at a frequency slightly lower than f(sub pe), (c) anti-Stokes peak at a frequency slightly higher than f(sub pe), and (d) a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>enhancement</b> below a few hundred Hz, (2) the frequencies and wave numbers of these spectral components satisfy the resonance conditions of the OTSI, and (3) the peak intensity of the wave packet is well above the thresholds for the OTSI as well as spatial collapse of envelope solitons.

40|$|In this work, {{a method}} for {{evaluating}} the characteristic impedance and wave number of homogeneous and isotropic porous materials is described. To implement the procedure, a two-microphone standing wave tube was modified and an existing transfer matrix method was made more efficient. Good agreement {{was found between the}} estimated acoustical properties of glass fiber and theoretical predictions. ^ It has been noted that the absorption coefficient of a porous sample placed in a standing wave tube is affected at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> by the sample 2 ̆ 7 s edge-constraint. Measurements made using the new transfer matrix procedure suggest that the edge-constraint results in a shearing resonance of the solid phase of the sample, at which frequency the transmission loss is a minimum: below that frequency, the transmission loss increases with decreasing frequency to a finite, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> limit. The transmission loss in this frequency range is typically larger than that predicted {{on the basis of the}} mass law. It was found that this constraint effect could be modeled accurately by using a finite element model based on the Biot poroelastic theory. ^ Laser vibrometer measurements were then used to verify the effect of the edge-constraint on circular glass fiber samples and to visualize the samples 2 ̆ 7 mode shapes. The laser measurements confirmed the existence of a shearing resonance at the transmission loss minimum. The measured spatial mode shapes were found to be in good agreement with corresponding FE predictions. ^ The effects of placing axial and radial constraints within a fibrous sample were then considered. By appropriate choice of internal constraints, it was found possible to control and extend the frequency range over which the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> transmission loss <b>enhancement</b> occurred. ^ Finally, it was demonstrated both experimentally and by using FE models that the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> transmission loss <b>enhancement</b> created by using internal constraints also occurs in three-dimensional geometries. Thus, it is possible to create systems that simultaneously display effective barrier and absorptive properties.

40|$|To make {{efficient}} use of their limited signaling capacity, sensory systems often use predictive coding. Predictive coding works by exploiting the statistical regularities of the environment—specifically, by filtering the sensory input to remove its predictable elements, thus enabling the neural signal {{to focus on what}} cannot be guessed. To do this, the neural filters must remove the environmental correlations. If predictive coding is to work well in multiple environments, sensory systems must adapt their filtering properties to fit each environment's statistics. Using the visual system as a model, we determine whether this happens. We compare retinal ganglion cell dynamics in two very different environments: white noise and natural. Because natural environments have more power than that of white noise at <b>low</b> temporal <b>frequencies,</b> predictive coding is expected to produce a suppression of <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> and an <b>enhancement</b> of high <b>frequencies,</b> compared with the behavior in a white-noise environment. We find that this holds, but only in part. First, predictive coding behavior is not uniform: most on cells manifest it, whereas off cells, on average, do not. Overlaid on this nonuniformity between cell classes is further nonuniformity within both cell classes. These findings indicate that functional considerations beyond predictive coding {{play an important role in}} shaping the dynamics of sensory adaptation. Moreover, the differences in behavior between on and off cell classes add to the growing evidence that these classes are not merely homogeneous mirror images of each other and suggest that their roles in visual processing are more complex than expected from the classic view...|$|R

In the present work, the mental performance of students exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at low and high levels (45 & 65 dB) were studied. Additionally, other factors such as annoyance, sensitivity to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise and hearing status of participants were considered. Materials and Methods: After generating <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises required for the study, a pilot study was conducted. Then, 54 students participated in the main study after preliminary tests. Their mental performances were evaluated with standard psychological tests while they were exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at 45 and 65 dBA. Results: The results showed that noise annoyance and <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise sensitivity do not have a significant correlation with age and sex. The results also revealed that, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 65 dB can decrease concentration (P= 0. 003) and increase response time (P= 0. 039) of performance in comparison with <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 45 dB.

Exposure to a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> EMF significantly increased the percentage of cells at the S phase of the cell cycle, coupled with {{a decrease in the}} percentage of cells in the G 1 phase (P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 05) but the effect was not frequency dependent. The percentage of CD 29 +/CD 71 − cells remained unchanged in the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> EMF-exposed hESC. The results suggested that <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> EMF influenced hESC proliferation in vitro, and this effect was related to the increased proportion of cells at the S phase...|$|R
