40|$|Advances in {{semiconductor}} manufacturing still lead to ever decreasing feature sizes and constantly allow higher degrees of integration in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Therefore the bandwidth requirements on the external interfaces of such systems on chips (SoC) are steadily growing. Yet, {{as the number}} of pins on these ASICs is not increasing in the same pace - known as pin limitation - the bandwidth per pin has to be increased. SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) technology, which allows to transfer data serially at very high data rates of 25 Gbps and more is a key technology to overcome pin limitation and exploit the computing power that can be achieved in todays SoCs. As such SerDes blocks together with the digital <b>logic</b> <b>interfacing</b> them form complex mixed signal systems, verification of performance and functional correctness is very challenging. In this thesis a novel mixed-signal design methodology is proposed, which tightly couples model and implementation in order to ensure consistency throughout the design cycles and hereby accelerate the overall implementation flow. A tool flow that has been developed is presented, which integrates well into state of the art electronic design automation (EDA) environments and enables the usage of this methodology in practice. Further, the design space of todays high-speed serial links is analyzed and an architecture is proposed, which pushes complexity into the digital domain in order to achieve robustness, portability between manufacturing processes and scaling with advanced node technologies. The all digital phase locked loop (PLL) and clock data recovery (CDR), which have been developed are described in detail. The developed design flow was used for the implementation of the SerDes architecture in a 28 nm silicon process and proved to be indispensable for future projects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} using semantic annotations in XML documents for better querying XML data. We assume that the annotations refer to an ontology defined in OWL (Web Ontology Language). The intention is then to combine syntactic querying techniques on XML documents with OWL ontology reasoning to filter out semantically irrelevant answers. The solution {{presented in this paper}} is an extension of the declarative rule-based XML query and transformation language Xcerpt. The extension allows to interface an ontology reasoner from Xcerpt rules. This makes it possible to use Xcerpt to filter extracted XML data using ontological information. Additionally it allows to retrieve ontological information by sending semantic queries to a reasoner. The prototype implementation uses DIG (Description <b>Logic</b> <b>interface)</b> for communication with the OWL reasoner RacerPro where the ontology queries are answered. ...|$|R
