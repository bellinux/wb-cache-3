25|$|With {{gunpowder}} being increasingly {{applied to}} mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, {{not just an}} individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew up hand in hand as the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for {{over a hundred years}} in coal breakers, massive noisy buildings full of conveyors, belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. <b>Like</b> <b>mine</b> pumps, the internal conveyors and trip-hammers contained within these 711 story buildings.|$|E

Blackmon said of the officials' actions that [...] "The idea that a book <b>like</b> <b>mine</b> is somehow incendiary or a call to violence is so absurd".|$|E
500|$|Anne Moody {{mentioned}} the Till case in her autobiography, Coming of Age in Mississippi, {{in which she}} states she first learned to hate during the fall of 1955. Audre Lorde's poem [...] "Afterimages" [...] (1981) focuses on {{the perspective of a}} black woman thinking of Carolyn Bryant 24 years after the murder and trial. Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 novel Your Blues Ain't <b>Like</b> <b>Mine</b> centers on the events of Till's death. Toni Morrison's play Dreaming Emmett (1986), is a feminist look at the roles {{of men and women in}} black society, which she was inspired to write while considering [...] "time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance." [...] Emmylou Harris includes a song called [...] "My Name is Emmett Till" [...] on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's death. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted Open Casket, a controversial work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till's mother of seeing him after his death.|$|E

[...] "Playing this teenage kid in this Jewish family that was so much <b>like</b> <b>mine</b> was amazing," [...] he said. [...] "The same dynamics, the same tensions in the household." [...] The role [...] "lit a passion" [...] {{that led him to}} pursue an acting career. [...] "I never wanted to do anything else."

2500|$|González's parents, Manuel Antonio González and Carmen Alire Alonso, {{migrated}} from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. {{in the early}} 1900s. González was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that [...] "Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot <b>like</b> <b>mine.</b> He had a great mother {{and there was always}} a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, he might have been spoiled as a kid. It's a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage". However, according to other sources, Gonzales's father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, González states, [...] "We had few luxuries at our house. Food wasn't abundant but it was simple and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes – inexpensive but clean." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Kenneth Branagh's {{frequent}} composing collaborator Patrick Doyle called Thor [...] "the most commercially {{high profile}} film I have done since Frankenstein", {{and noted that}} [...] "Marvel Studios have a brand in Thor. Their interest, <b>like</b> <b>mine,</b> was for strong thematic material that would {{capture the essence of}} that brand." [...] Branagh and Doyle wanted the score to have a contemporary feel, while Doyle [...] "was also eager for the score to contain a strong sense of melody, which [...] responds to in my work. He was keen, as indeed I was, that the grand images were not in any way hyperbolized, and {{that there would be a}} balance between playing with, and against the images." [...] To distinguish between the realms of Asgard and Earth musically, Doyle used [...] "broader orchestral strokes and thicker orchestration" [...] to depict the grandeur and beauty of Asgard, and more [...] "contemporary, electronic and percussion driven" [...] music for the Earth scenes, incorporating the then-popular ostinato technique [...] "in a symphonic way whenever appropriate".|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms {{about the}} {{evidence}} {{used to justify}} the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: [...] "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement {{of the means of}} inspections." [...] In response to Donald Rumsfeld's reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as 'Old Europe', Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st Century: [...] "This message comes to you today from an old country, France, from a continent <b>like</b> <b>mine,</b> Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. (...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with {{all the members of the}} international community. It believes in our ability to build together a better world." [...] The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations. Anti-French propaganda exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 [...] "Sacrifice" [...] of the GIs that France had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled [...] "Chirac is a worm" [...] and including ad hominem attacks such as [...] "Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe". Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.|$|E
