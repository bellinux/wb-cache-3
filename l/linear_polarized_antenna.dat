40|$|Dual linear {{polarization}} microstrip antenna configurations are very suitable for high-performance satellites, wireless communication and radar applications. This paper presents a new method {{to improve the}} co-cross polarization discrimination (XPD) for dual <b>linear</b> <b>polarized</b> microstrip <b>antennas</b> at 10  GHz. For this, three various configurations of a dual {{linear polarization}} antenna utilizing metamaterial unit cells are shown. In the first layout, the microstrip patch antenna is loaded with two pairs of spiral ring resonators, in the second model, a split ring resonator is placed between two microstrip feed lines, and in the third design, a complementary split ring resonators are etched in the ground plane. This work has two primary goals: the first {{is related to the}} addition of metamaterial unit cells to the antenna structure which permits compensation for an asymmetric current distribution flow on the microstrip antenna and thus yields a symmetrical current distribution on it. This compensation leads to an important enhancement in the XPD in comparison to a conventional dual <b>linear</b> <b>polarized</b> microstrip patch <b>antenna.</b> The simulation reveals an improvement of 7. 9, 8. 8, and 4  dB in the E and H planes for the three designs, respectively, in the XPD as compared to the conventional dual <b>linear</b> <b>polarized</b> patch <b>antenna.</b> The second objective {{of this paper is to}} present the characteristics and performances of the designs of the spiral ring resonator (S-RR), split ring resonator (SRR), and complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) metamaterial unit cells.

40|$|Abstract—Polarization {{reconfigurable}} patch antennas {{which can}} switch polarization states among {{vertical and horizontal}} linear polarization (LP), left- and right-hand circular polarization (CP) is demonstrated in this paper. The original orthogonal <b>linear</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> is a square patch fed by two ports at the adjacent edges. CP operations can be activated by introducing perturbations at the opposite corners of the patch. If a diode is loaded on every perturbed corner, the antenna polarization states can be alternated by {{controlling the bias voltage}} of two PIN diodes. Perturbation elements can be cut on the patch or on the ground. Two antenna prototypes are suggested, simulated, and verified by experiments. These polarization reconfigurable antennas have good antenna performances of low reflection coefficient, axial ratio, and cross-polarization (X-pol), and high isolation between two LP operations. They have concise structure with only two PIN diodes being required. The two reconfigurable antennas are low cost and can be integrated easily in wireless communication systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{markets for}} smart home {{products}} and services are expected to grow over the next years, driven by the increasing demands of homeowners considering energy monitoring, management, environmental controls and security. Many of these new systems will be installed in existing homes and offices and therefore using radio based systems for cost reduction. A drawback of radio based systems in indoor environments are fading effects which {{lead to a high}} variance of the received signal strength and thereby to a difficult predictability of the encountered path loss of the various communication links. For that reason it is necessary to derive a statistical path loss model which can be used to plan a reliable and cost effective radio network. This paper presents the results of a measurement campaign, which was performed in six buildings to deduce realistic radio channel models for a high variety of indoor radio propagation scenarios in the short range devices (SRD) band at 868 MHz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the MIMO performance of three candidate antenna array designs, each embedded within a PDA footprint, using indoor wideband channel measurements at 5. 2 GHz alongside channel simulations. A channel model which employs the plane-wave approximation was used to combine the embedded antenna radiation patterns of the candidate devices obtained from far-field pattern measurements and multipath component parameters from an indoor ray-tracer. The 4 -element candidate arrays were each constructed using a different type of antenna element, and despite the diverse element directivities, pattern characteristics, and polarization purities, all three devices were constructed to fully exploit diversity in polarization, space, and angle. Thus, low correlation and high information theoretic capacity was observed in each case.
