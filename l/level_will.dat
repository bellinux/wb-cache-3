5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper <b>level</b> <b>will</b> be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger {{that he might}} be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each <b>level</b> <b>will</b> have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life <b>level</b> <b>will</b> decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic <b>level</b> <b>will</b> decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack <b>level</b> <b>will</b> strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk {{from one end of}} the game world to the other, and thus each game <b>level</b> <b>will</b> usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars {{is a life}} {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player assumes the role of one of three pop idols at a time: Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani or Ryō Akizuki. An idol's statistics are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image <b>level</b> <b>will</b> also increase. The game is largely divided into two modes: a story mode which encompasses normal gameplay, and a separate stage mode for performing songs outside of the story mode. At the start of every in-game week on Monday, the player is shown current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image ranked first, second and third in popularity. This gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity by augmenting an idol's statistics via the choice of song they will perform and what costumes they wear during an audition. Also on Monday, the player is first given the option to choose which costume and accessories to wear for performances, and to choose one of the available songs. Each costume, accessory and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute. The player can also modify the choreography and camera positioning used during performances at this time.|$|E

The recommended metering approach uses a power sum of the A-weighted audio level in all channels.

25|$|Individuals with {{substantial}} net worth. Substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law, since {{private equity funds}} are generally less regulated than ordinary mutual funds. For example, in the US, most funds require potential investors to qualify as accredited investors, which requires $1million of net worth, $200,000 of individual income, or $300,000 of joint income (with spouse) for two documented years and an expectation that such income <b>level</b> <b>will</b> continue.|$|E
25|$|The IRF {{gives the}} {{probability}} that a person with a given ability <b>level</b> <b>will</b> answer correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of item parameters for the IRF.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} opiates, {{overdose}} by heroin alone is rather rare, and most reported overdoses occur either due to {{combination with other}} sedatives, such as benzodiazepines and ethanol, or after a person has been abstinent {{for some time and}} then uses. Their tolerance <b>level</b> <b>will</b> have decreased but user does not often account for time abstinent and overdoses or as a purposeful act of suicide. Heroin overdose is also reversible within minutes with administration of the opioid antagonist Naloxone.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{compression}} is {{a method}} of electromyographically reducing the speech signal, resulting in {{a decrease in the}} time required for presentation of a message by increasing the number of words per minute. Research in the area of speech compression has to this time been focused on determining the listener response by means of comprehension testing. While comprehension testing uncovers the individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to resolve, organize, and recall a message at accelerated rates, it gives no information about the listener 2 ̆ 7 s psychophysical response to compression. Does the individual find listening to compression to be tension-provoking or stressful? Or can a listener accommodate accelerated speech without stress? The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the individual 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of compressed speech. 2 ̆ 2 Acceptability 2 ̆ 2 was operationally defined as finding no significant differences between tension levels produced while listening to normal speech rate as compared to tensions produced while listening to compressed speech rates. Tension levels were determined by an electromyograph which measures the amount of tension within a muscle. The specific hypotheses researched were: Hypothesis 1. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> differ significantly with Order of Presentation. Hypothesis 2. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> differ significantly with Rate of Presentation. Hypothesis 3. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> differ significantly between Males and Females. Hypothesis 4. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> show significant interaction between Order of Presentation and Rate of Presentation. Hypothesis 5. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> show significant interaction between Order of Presentation and Sex of the Listener. Hypothesis 6. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> show significant interaction between Rate of Presentation and Sex of the Listener. Hypothesis 7. Sampled muscular tension <b>levels</b> <b>will</b> show significant interaction among Order of Presentation, Rate of Presentation, and Sex of the Listener. A 6 x 3 x 2 factorial de sign was constructed to examine muscular tension levels. The controlled factors were Order of Presentation, Rate of Presentation, and Sex of Listener. Rate of Presentation included three speech sample s: normal (189 words per minute), speech compressed 25...|$|R
