25|$|The <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the massive}} building, {{together}} with adjacent constructions, and the surrounding brick and masonry fence, hides to the local transient the open and greenish interior patio of the residence. The patio can be access through the zaguan, the carport, or directly from the upper level eastern end, using a brick and masonry half-turn with landing staircase. As of 2013 the house was vacant, and thus the small urban courtyard-backyard reflects abandonment. However, there are certain built elements within the area that still warrant further description. Most important {{of these is the}} marble flared stair, identical to the zaguan staircase (but with one less riser) and the iron grilled gate, which replicates also the zaguans iron gate. Many early twentieth century Vives' family photos at the patio, using the staircase as stage, suggest the social importance of the location. A water fountain sits {{at the center of the}} patio, another favorite spot for early 20th century family photos. There are two separate brick and masonry constructions in a precarious state, currently used as construction material storage area. During the 19th century, the buildings were use as residence for the service personnel.|$|E

50|$|Croft and Boerner's design {{drew on the}} {{established}} best practices for American junior high schools. These favored H-, I-, or <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layouts</b> and flat roofs, fireproofing, large windows for natural light in classrooms, good air circulation, a well-stocked library, science laboratories, and specialized rooms for music, industrial, and vocational training. Auditoriums and gyms were often planned to serve the larger community as public event spaces. Croft and Boerner's design included an auditorium stage that could be opened up to the gymnasium behind it for additional seating.|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} compare two {{evolutionary}} algorithm based methods for rectangular architectural layout generation: dense packing and subdivision algorithms. We analyze {{the characteristics of}} the two methods on the basis of three floor plan sce- narios. Our analyses include the speed with which solutions are generated, the reliability with which optimal solutions can be found, and the number of different solutions that can be found overall. In a following step, we discuss the methods with respect to their different user interaction capabilities. In addition, we show that each method has the capability to generate more complex <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layouts.</b> Finally,we conclude that neither of the methods is superior but that each of them is suitable for use in distinct application scenarios because of its different properties...|$|R
50|$|The land {{on which}} this house was built belonged to Robert Sharp Davis, Sr. a {{descendant}} of Ebenezer Davis, who owned land in Brookline since the mid-18th century. It was built for Davis' son, also named Robert Sharp Davis, {{and is one of}} four similar Italianate houses in the immediate area. It is particularly rare as a well-preserved example of the classic Italianate box-like house with a central gable; most of the town's other Italianate houses outside this grouping are <b>L-shaped</b> in <b>layout.</b> The elder Davis' brother was Thomas Aspinwall Davis, who owned land {{on the other side of}} Brookline Village, and served as Mayor of Boston.|$|R
5000|$|Bellevue House {{is notable}} for the non-symmetrical Italian Villa style of its {{architecture}}. Features of Italianate architecture at Bellevue House include an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> with two wings extending from a square central tower; different varieties and shapes of windows and roof gables; and multiple small balconies.|$|E

50|$|Video {{cards that}} can be {{modified}} using software to faster versions (without regard to clock speed) usually contain mostly the same hardware. Softmodding a card should not include changing the video card's BIOS, as that is a BIOS flash. Currently only four softmods are known, a Radeon 9500 NP to a 9500 Pro (128 bit) or 9700 (256 bit), a Radeon 9800SE (with 256-bit <b>L-shaped</b> memory <b>layout</b> on the PCB) to a Radeon 9800 Pro, a GeForce 6200 to a 6600, and a GeForce 6800NU to a 6800GT. The act of a softmod usually enables pixel rendering pipelines, though may also include other enhancements. A softmodded card may not always reach the same performance as the real card it has been changed to, but the difference should be very little; and generally not noticeable. The softmodding is not guaranteed to always work; sometimes thepipelines have been disabled for a reason, e.g., a defect that produces artifacts when enabled.|$|R
50|$|The 1.5 story Greek Revival wood {{frame house}} was built c. 1858 by Charles L. Baxter, a local housewright who then lived there until his death. The house has an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> with the front {{entrance}} {{on the front of}} the main block, and a porch in the crook of the L. The house's corners are decorated with pilasters, as is the front door entry, which is topped by an entablature and lintel shelf.|$|E
50|$|The Pressey-Eustis House is a {{historic}} house at 14 Stevens Street in Winchester, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house {{was built in the}} early 1850s, and is a fine local example of Gothic Victorian decoration. It has an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> typical of the period, with a porch at the crook of the L. Its most distinctive features are the vergeboard featuring an unusual acorn pattern, and the finials at the gable tops. George Eustis, town treasurer 1910-24, lived here from c. 1870 to 1940.|$|E
50|$|The Laws-Jarvis House is a {{historic}} house at 409 North Main Street in Beebe, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a weatherboard exterior and brick foundation. Its original form, as built about 1880, featured an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> with central entrance gabled porch supported by slender columns with plain capitals, and windows with pedimented lintels. It has since been altered by an addition to the rear, giving its roof an overall hip shape. The house is one of White County's surviving 19th-century houses.|$|E
5000|$|House at 60 William Street is a {{historic}} house at 19 Jefferson Street in the Newton Corner village of Newton, Massachusetts. It is listed at 60 William Street in Massachusetts cultural inventory and National Register listings. [...] Built in 1850, it is a well-preserved example of a modest Italianate wood frame house. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> that has a three-story tower at the crook of the L. Italianate styling includes the tower's shallow-pitch hip roof, and paired round-arch windows on its top level.|$|E
50|$|The Carr-Jeeves House {{stands in}} a small {{residential}} area northwest of downtown Winchester, {{on the north side}} of Lake Street between Middlesex and Linden Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full second story, and a clapboarded exterior. It has an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> with a gable end section facing the street, below which is a squared projecting bay. The windows on this facade are arched in polygonal fashion. The gables and eaves (including those on the roof of the projecting bay) have dentil moulding and brackets. There is a three story turret in the crook of the L, also topped by a mansard roof.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{exterior}} is intact, the interior {{has undergone a}} substantial collapse or demolition of the first-floor ceiling, though the interior walls are still standing. A stone staircase provides limited access to {{what is left of}} the first floor. The fort has a roughly <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> with troop accommodation on the east-west leg of the L (a huge oven can still be seen in one of the first-floor rooms) and gun turrets on the north-south leg. There are four turrets positioned in a line with their Škoda-built rotating steel gun turrets still in situ. Associated ammunition storage rooms are located nearby. A single observation turret, also with its cupola still present, is located {{at the southern end of}} the L.|$|E
50|$|The Case-Shiras-Dearmore House is a {{historic}} house at 351 East 4th Street in Mountain Home, Arkansas, United States. It is a 2½-story plain traditional wood-frame structure, with a roughly <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> a stone foundation, and a cross-gable roof. A single-story shed-roofed porch stands on the crook of the L, which faces south. The house {{was built in the}} 1870s by Dr. J. H. Case, but its most notable resident was Tom Shiras, who acquired the house in 1900 and later married into the Case family. Shiras and his brother published the Baxter Bulletin, a newspaper that grew under his control to become a major regional news outlet with significant editorial influence. The Shiras family owned the property into the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Work on {{optimizing}} kitchen layouts {{was begun}} in the 1920s by Lillian Moller Gilbreth, an industrial psychologist and engineer, {{in partnership with the}} Brooklyn Borough Gas Company. Gilbreth’s Kitchen Practical was unveiled in 1929 at a Women’s Exposition based on Gilbreth’s research on motion savings. Gilbreth referred to the <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> as [...] "circular routing" [...] which later came to be called the kitchen work triangle. [...] A specific model was developed in the 1940s to address the efficiency of the kitchen space between the major work centers: Cooking (range), Preparation (sink/dishwasher) and Food Storage (refrigerator). It was designed to maximize the efficiency of a one-cook kitchen that stemmed from Taylorist principles {{that had to do with}} time-motion studies from around the turn of the century. The University of Illinois School of Architecture developed the work triangle to emphasize cost reduction by standardizing construction. This resulted in a variety of configurations.|$|E

5000|$|The monastery {{building}} {{was designed by}} a young architect Zbigniew Kupiec and his older collaborator Tadeusz Kossak, both since the early 1930s active in Gdynia; at that time Kupiec was already renown {{for a number of}} residential buildings along the main city street and prestigious villas in the plushy Kamienna Góra district; in total he designed some 40 buildings in Gdynia of the 1930s. Based on <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout,</b> the monastery edifice consisted of two symmetrical wings of approximately 35 meters length and 15 meters width each. Built in traditional technology and almost exclusively of bricks, it housed 22 individual cells, refectory, communication and common utility spaces; the adjacent large chapel was based on a 275 square meters floor plan, its main hall 7 meters high and with separate entrances from the monastery and for the public. Deprived of architectural novelties it is usually noted as an example of functionalism.Original design of the church was also prepared by Kupiec and his new collaborator, Zygmunt Gawlik, in the late 1940s. Unlike the down-to-earth monastery building it envisioned a large construction, which located on the hill was intended as a major city landmark. The temple was to be based on rectangular layout some 45 meters long and 25 meters width; the plan featured a hall church with central nave braced by two lower aisles, generously lit with vertically oriented windows running through all height of the walls. The front also emphasized vertical lines, reinforced by a slender, lighthouse-like tower framed in-between the church and the monastery; a two-pitched, gable roof was envisioned. The design was from the onset challenged by the Franciscan authorities, concerned with interior features like glass walls, deemed extravagant. Even when dropped, the project was rejected by municipal authorities with no reason specified. [...] A new design, eventually followed and leading to construction of the currently standing building, was worked out hastily in 1956. The hurry resulted from political circumstances; ecclesiastical authorities feared that apparent political thaw might be short-lived and insisted Kupiec produces new plans which might get approved before the communists change their course again. The new plan partially resembled the old one, as it was based on approximately the same layout, featured the same gabled roof, proposed high side windows and emphasized verticality, but it also advanced some major alterations. Central nave with 2 aisles was replaced with a somewhat wider nave with only one, Eastern aisle. It was separated from the central space by massive piers supporting a gallery, a new feature rather unusual in modern Roman Catholic churches. A slender tower was replaced with a larger one, crowned with two high spires; it was removed from in-between the church and the monastery to the South-Eastern corner of the temple. Most importantly, a one-level construction was replaced with two halls, taking advantage of the slope gradient; the lower one, accessible only from the North, was to house educational and social activities but was eventually turned into a church, the upper one, accessible from the North and the South, was to become the main church itself. Construction material was bricks; eventually it took some 1,2m of them to complete the building. Currently the design is noted as containing some Gothic references, though principally related to modernism and simplified cubism. Hurried architectural work is blamed for some deficiencies; upper church suffered from very poor visibility from the aisle, framed by massive piers, and from the gallery. The tower proved to be inappropriate for huge bells mounted, their motion threatening the very construction.Interior of the upper church took form in course of decades, shaped by esthetic preferences of the friars. The ambience is hugely determined by stained glass windows; composed of square, non-figurative tiles, they are grouped according to the color key and are supposed to reflect three mysteries of faith: creation, redemption and salvation. For many years the single eye-catching decorative feature was giant painting of Maksymilian Kolbe against the Auschwitz camp background, authored by one of the friars, Teofil Zimnoch. It is now removed from the church and substituted by a much smaller installation; as the single dominating object it was replaced in the 1990s by a giant crucifix designed by Stanisław Radwański, at that time head of the Gdańsk Akademia Sztuk Pięknych; naturalistically presented tortured body provides a counter-reference to the spirited face of crucified Jesus. Another giant object of the interior is painting of Mary as Queen of the Earth, painted in 1961 by Felicissimus Sztyka. Red-brick walls are scarcely decorated, except for the wooden Via Crucis of Stanisław Bąkowski. The chapel of St. Maksymlian, opened in the 1970s, is an example of modern design based on central layout, combining paintings of Mieczysław Kościelniak, stone sculptures of Piotr Żarnowski and metalwork of Józef Fukś and Józef Szczepanik.|$|E
40|$|This note {{presents}} further {{experimental evidence}} {{on the effect of}} the layout on the mooring forces of floating breakwaters under irregular waves. The latest results, here summarized, have been obtained by means of physical model tests carried out on an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> and are compared to data previously published by the authors. The experimental facility is located at the University of Padova, Italy. Results are given in non-dimensional form and concern the transmission phenomenon and the loads on mooring and tie rods interconnecting adjacent modules. It is confirmed that under more complex layouts, the wave transmission increases, due to smaller dissipation, maximum mooring forces decrease and link forces largely increase...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} simulation, {{fabrication}} and characterization of a 3 -DOF piezoelectric micro vibratory stage design with large X/Y-tilting and Z-translational motion capabilities. The vibratory stage utilizes four piezoelectric crab-leg suspensions formed of bulk-PZT/Si unimorph beams in a <b>L-shaped</b> <b>layout.</b> FEA simulations are utilized {{to optimize the}} PZT/Si thickness ratio and characterize the 3 -DOF actuation modes and off-axis coupling. A 3 × 3 -mm 2 sized stage is fabricated via a process that includes bonding and thinning of bulk-PZT substrates on pre-patterned silicon features and micro-patterning of thick PZT films via wet etching. At ± 25 V static excitation, X-tilting and Y-tilting angle ranges are measured as> 2. 3 °, and Z-translational displacement is 42 µm. At resonance, the tilting angle range is 12. 2 ° (~ 1. 77 kHz), and the vertical displacement range is 387 µm (0. 93 kHz). The device consumes only 100 µW and < 450 µW during static and resonant operation, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This residence, {{consisting}} of two floors and a <b>l-shaped</b> <b>layout</b> with wings of equal length, houses two independent apartments on the lower level and twelve dormitory type rooms equipped with bathrooms and kitchens common to every two rooms {{on the ground floor}} and to every four on the upper level. &# 13; The project is characterized by its simplicity of design, which strives to harmonize the new structure, both in the materials and in the formal approach, with the traditional architecture present in the surroundings. In this direction, fundamentally, the solution adopted for the roof —covered with slate— stands out, which are interrupted for window openings and to provide abundant lighting for the central distributing corridor on the first floor which is distant from the perimeter. &# 13; The achievements in the functional design are integrated into a pleasant and attractive solution which can be appreciated from both the inside and the outside. Esta Residencia, de dos niveles de altura y planta configurada como una «L» de brazos iguales, alberga dos apartamentos independientes en el nivel inferior, y doce salones-dormitorio, dotados de servicios de baño y cocina comunes a cada dos dormitorios, en planta baja, y a cada cuatro, en el nivel superior. &# 13; El proyecto se caracteriza por su sencillez de diseño, que procura armonizar la nueva construcción, tanto en los materiales como en el planteamiento formal, con la arquitectura tradicional existente en el entorno. En este sentido se destaca, fundamentalmente, la solución adoptada para la cubierta, revestida de pizarra, que se interrumpe para abrir huecos de ventana y para iluminar abundantemente el corredor central de distribución en la planta primera, alejado del perímetro. &# 13; Los logros en la solución funcional se integran en un diseño agradable y atractivo, apreciable tanto interior como exteriormente...|$|E
