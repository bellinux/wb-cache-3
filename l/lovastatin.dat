5|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} drugs, the statins, {{were initially}} produced by fungi including Penicillium. The first commercial statin, <b>lovastatin,</b> was fermented by the mould Aspergillus terreus.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and <b>lovastatin</b> from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications, {{conditions}} that warrant withholding treatment with <b>lovastatin,</b> include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. <b>Lovastatin</b> is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Due to {{its potential to}} disrupt infant lipid metabolism, <b>lovastatin</b> {{should not be taken}} while breastfeeding. Patients with liver disease should not take <b>lovastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> {{is derived}} from a fungus source and {{simvastatin}} and pravastatin are chemical modifications of <b>lovastatin</b> {{and as a result}} do not differ much in structure from <b>lovastatin.</b> All three are partially reduced napthylene ring structures. Simvastatin and <b>lovastatin</b> are inactive lactones which must be metabolized to their active hydroxy-acid forms in order to inhibit HMGR. Type 2 statins all exist in their active hydroxy-acid forms. Fluvastatin has indole ring structure, while atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have pyrrole and pyrimidine based ring structure respectively. The lipophilic cerivastatin has a pyridine-based ring structure.|$|E
25|$|These drugs include {{rosuvastatin}} (CRESTOR), <b>lovastatin</b> (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or <b>lovastatin</b> (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic <b>lovastatin).</b>|$|E
25|$|Large-scale trials {{confirmed}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>lovastatin.</b> Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and <b>lovastatin</b> {{was approved by the}} US FDA in 1987. It was the first statin approved by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> (Merck's Mevacor) is a statin drug, {{used for}} {{lowering}} cholesterol {{in those with}} hypercholesterolemia to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. <b>Lovastatin</b> is a naturally occurring compound found in low concentrations in food such as oyster mushrooms, red yeast rice, and Pu-erh.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, some {{small-scale}} {{clinical investigations}} of <b>lovastatin,</b> a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from Aspergillus terreus, in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, {{with very few}} adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with <b>lovastatin</b> revealed no toxicity of the type thought {{to be associated with}} compactin, clinical studies continued.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> tablets {{are tested}} for {{dissolution}} and assay as per the USP.|$|E
25|$|In plant physiology, <b>lovastatin</b> has {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as inhibitor of cytokinin biosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|As with atorvastatin, simvastatin, {{and other}} statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, {{drinking}} grapefruit juice during <b>lovastatin</b> therapy {{may increase the}} risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid naringin, or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, and may account for the in vivo effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of <b>lovastatin,</b> and increasing its plasma concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Simple organic {{reactions}} {{were used to}} get to <b>lovastatin</b> {{as shown in the}} scheme.|$|E
25|$|Several statin {{cholesterol-lowering}} drugs (such as <b>lovastatin,</b> from Aspergillus terreus) {{are derived}} from molds.|$|E
25|$|Mevalonate is a {{required}} building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and <b>lovastatin</b> interferes with its production by {{acting as a}} reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. <b>Lovastatin</b> is a prodrug, an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form {{in which it is}} administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form.|$|E
25|$|A major bulk {{of work in}} the {{synthesis}} of <b>lovastatin</b> was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> is {{composed}} of two polyketide chains derived from acetate, two and four carbons long, coupled in head-to-tail fashion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> tablets are {{preserved}} when stored in well-closed, light-resistant containers {{in a cool}} place or at controlled room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Limit for {{dissolution}} – Not {{less than}} 80% (Q) of the labeled amount of <b>lovastatin</b> is dissolved in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes {{the conversion of}} HMG-CoA to mevalonate.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies that}} <b>lovastatin</b> {{is a unique}} {{compound}} synthesized by A. terreus and that mevastatin is not an intermediate in its formation.|$|E
25|$|Limit for assay – Each tablet {{contains}} {{not less}} than 90% and not more than 110% of the labeled amount of <b>lovastatin,</b> tested by HPLC analysis.|$|E
25|$|Compactin and <b>lovastatin,</b> natural {{products}} {{with a powerful}} inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, were discovered in the 1970s, and taken into clinical development as potential drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of <b>lovastatin</b> {{is for the}} {{treatment}} of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.|$|E
25|$|P. Roy Vagelos, chief {{scientist}} and later CEO of Merck & Co, was interested, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated <b>lovastatin</b> (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus Aspergillus terreus, first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> {{and other}} statins {{have been studied}} for their chemopreventive and {{chemotherapeutic}} effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies. More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs. It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, and to subsequent G1-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), <b>lovastatin</b> (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.|$|E
25|$|Hirama {{synthesized}} compactin {{and used}} one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to <b>lovastatin.</b> The synthetic sequence {{is shown in the}} schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{researchers}} in the United States and Japan were isolating <b>lovastatin</b> from Aspergillus and monacolins from Monascus, respectively, the latter being the same fungus used to make red yeast rice but cultured under carefully controlled conditions. Chemical analysis soon showed that <b>lovastatin</b> and monacolin K are identical. The article [...] "The origin of statins" [...] summarizes how the two isolations, documentations and patent applications were just months apart. <b>Lovastatin</b> became the patented, prescription drug Mevacor for Merck & Co. Red yeast rice {{went on to become}} a contentious non-prescription dietary supplement in the United States and other countries.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval {{for the treatment of}} hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when Endo et al. reported the discovery of mevastatin, a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of Penicillium citrium. [...] Mevastatin was demonstrated to be an unusually potent inhibitor of the target enzyme and of cholesterol biosynthesis. Subsequent to the first reports describing mevastatin, efforts were initiated to search for other naturally occurring inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase. This led to the discovery of a novel fungal metabolite – <b>lovastatin.</b> The structure of <b>lovastatin</b> was determined to be different from that of mevastatin by the presence of a six alphamethyl group in the hexahydronaphthalene ring.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> {{is usually}} well tolerated, {{with the most}} common side effects being, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: creatine phosphokinase elevation, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, muscle aches or pains, nausea, indigestion, weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. As with all statin drugs, it can rarely cause myopathy, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), dermatomyositis or rhabdomyolysis. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on <b>lovastatin</b> should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include: ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2016, {{there are}} at least 30 brands available. Many of these avoid the FDA {{restriction}} by not having any appreciable monacolin content. Their labels and websites say no more than [...] "fermented according to traditional Asian methods" [...] or [...] "similar to that used in culinary applications." [...] The labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol. If they do not contain <b>lovastatin,</b> do not claim to contain <b>lovastatin,</b> and do not make a claim to lower cholesterol, they are not subject to FDA action. Two reviews confirm that the monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range, with some containing negligible monacolins.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> {{and other}} {{prescription}} [...] "statin" [...] drugs inhibit cholesterol synthesis by blocking {{action of the}} enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. As a consequence, circulating total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are lowered. In a meta-analysis of 91 randomized clinical trials of ≥12 weeks duration, totaling 68,485 participants, LDL-cholesterol was lowered by 24-49% depending on the statin. Different strains of Monascus fungus will produce different amounts of monacolins. The 'Went' strain of Monascus purpureus (purpureus = dark red in Latin), when properly fermented and processed, will yield a dried red yeast rice powder that is approximately 0.4% monacolins, of which roughly half will be monacolin K (identical to <b>lovastatin).</b> Monacolin content of a red yeast rice product is described in a 2008 clinical trial report.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lovastatin</b> is also {{naturally}} {{produced by}} certain higher fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) and closely related Pleurotus spp. [...] Research into {{the effect of}} oyster mushroom and its extracts on the cholesterol levels of laboratory animals has been extensive, although the effect has been demonstrated in a very limited number of human subjects.|$|E
2500|$|All statins are (metabolized) by the liver, {{which causes}} their low {{systemic}} bioavailability. <b>Lovastatin</b> and simvastatin are administered in their lactone forms, {{which is more}} lipophilic than their free acid forms, and therefore {{they have to be}} activated by hydrolysis to the active anionic carboxylate form. Cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of the statins, with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes being the most dominant. CYP3A4 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of <b>lovastatin,</b> simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of Fluvastatin, but CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes also contribute to the metabolism of Fluvastatin. Rosuvastatin is [...] metabolized to a small degree by CYP2C9 {{and to a lesser extent}} by CYP2C19 isoenzymes. Pravastatin is not metabolized by CYP isoenzymes to any appreciable extent. The statins that have the ability to be metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes may therefore avoid drug accumulation when one of the pathways is inhibited by co-administered drugs.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a number}} of statins are on the market: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, <b>lovastatin,</b> pitavastatin, pravastatin, {{rosuvastatin}} and simvastatin. Several combination preparations of a statin and another agent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available. In 2005, sales were estimated at US$18.7billion in the United States. The best-selling statin is atorvastatin, which in 2003 became the best-selling pharmaceutical in history. The manufacturer Pfizer reported sales of US$12.4billion in 2008. Due to patent expirations, several statins became available in 2016 as less expensive generics.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the FDA {{placed a}} ban on the sale of dietary {{supplements}} derived from red yeast rice, which naturally contains <b>lovastatin,</b> arguing that products containing prescription agents require drug approval. [...] Judge Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, granted a motion by Cholestin's manufacturer, Pharmanex, that the agency's ban was illegal under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act because the product was marketed as a dietary supplement, not a drug.|$|E
