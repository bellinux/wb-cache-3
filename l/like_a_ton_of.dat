2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the game, Beckham was vilified by the English press for his perceived petulance and naïvety {{on the international}} stage; the headline in The Daily Mirror the following day described the England team as: [...] "10 Heroic Lions, One Stupid Boy."

The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.|$|E

Two methods of odor-removal were investigated, and geosmin and 2 -methylisoborneol odor-removals, from both odor-free and CAP waters, were achieved using either adsorptive or oxidative techniques. Adsorptive odor-removal was effective from a threshold odor number (<b>TON)</b> <b>of</b> 20 to <b>a</b> <b>TON</b> <b>of</b> 1 {{with the use}} of powdered activated carbon.
