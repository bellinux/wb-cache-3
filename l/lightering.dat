5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as <b>lightering.</b> In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. <b>Lightering</b> is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated <b>lightering</b> points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, during the Australian gold rushes, Long Jetty reached {{a period of}} maximum use whereby ships where {{constantly}} coming and going. Even at its full length, {{it was necessary to}} use <b>lightering</b> with smaller vessels to bring in many of the shipments. The opening of Fremantle Harbour eliminated the need for <b>lightering</b> and helped to make Long Jetty obsolete as an importing and exporting structure.|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong widely uses <b>lighters</b> in {{midstream}} operations where <b>lighters</b> transport cargo, mostly containers, between oceangoing vessels or {{to and from}} terminals. <b>Lighters</b> in Hong Kong are usually equipped with cranes of 40-60 tonnes capacity, and the largest ones can carry up to 300 TEU containers (empties). <b>Lighters</b> are not fitted with engines but are towed by tugboats. In 2007, midstream operators handled about 2 million TEUs and 5 million TEUs were transported as river trade cargo which are heavily dependent on <b>lighters.</b>|$|R

25|$|The main {{commodities}} exported {{from the}} colony were wool, wheat, and timber. All {{of these materials}} were shipped in large vessels {{that could not be}} directly loaded from the jetty and required the use of smaller vessels for loading purposes. In December 1887 the jetty was extended to a length of 2,387 feet and the original south-westerly section was widened to 42 feet. This would allow six large vessels to be berthed at one time in water that was deeper than provided by the original structure. This addition led to the Ocean Jetty becoming known as the Long Jetty. In 1896 a final extension stretched the jetty an additional 457 feet out into the ocean. This extension was brought about due to the difficulty of <b>lightering.</b> With a total length of 3,294 feet, it was possible to facilitate eight large ships at once; however, <b>lightering</b> was still required.|$|E

5000|$|Specialized [...] "windproof" [...] butane <b>lighters</b> are {{manufactured}} for demanding {{conditions such as}} shipboard, high altitude, and wet climates. Some dedicated models double as synthetic rope cutters. Such <b>lighters</b> are often far hotter than normal <b>lighters</b> (those that use a [...] "soft flame") and can burn in excess of 1100 C. Contrary to common misconception, the windproof capabilities are not achieved from [...] "higher pressure" [...] fuel, with <b>lighters</b> using the same fuel (butane) as standard <b>lighters,</b> and therefore developing the same vapour pressure. Instead, windproof <b>lighters</b> mix the fuel with air, and pass the butane/air mixture through a catalytic coil. An electric spark starts the initial flame, and soon after the coil is hot enough to sustain a catalytic reaction and cause the fuel/air mixture to burn on contact.|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, {{a wealthy}} Nome mine-owner and businessman, Jafet Lindeberg, {{chartered}} the Corwin (Captain R.J. Healy) from the Kotzebue Transportation and Trading Company {{to attempt a}} rescue the Karluk survivors from Wrangel Island. She reached Wrangel Island {{one day after the}} survivors had been rescued by Olaf Swenson and his crew in the King & Winge. She then proceeded to look for four missing members of Karluk's crew, circling Herald Island without seeing any sign of the missing men. The Corwin struck a reef off Cape Douglas on her return trip and went hard aground. [...] She was refloated by jettisoning and <b>lightering</b> supplies to lighten ship, with [...] assistance from the USRC Bear and a crew from the Nome Lifesaving station.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{states that}} the {{original}} jetty was too shallow for most ocean-going vessels and lengthened multiple times, but never reached an adequate length. [...] It was always necessary to use lighters {{to help with the}} removal of cargo from larger vessels. Of the 600,000 tons of materials that went through the Long Jetty in 1897, over one third of the materials required <b>lightering</b> with smaller vessels. In 1897 the jetty was a total of one kilometre in length and reached a total depth of only 7 metres at its furthest end. The two extensions were built by R.O. Law and Mathew Price. In 1887, when the contract was first given to R.O. Law, he was still a minor. R.O. Law was also given the task of demolishing Fremantle Long Jetty after it was considered a hazard to pedestrians.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightering</b> (also called lighterage) is {{the process}} of {{transferring}} cargo between vessels of different sizes, usually between a barge and a bulker or oil tanker. <b>Lightering</b> is undertaken to reduce a vessel's draft in order to enter port facilities which cannot accept very large ocean-going vessels. <b>Lightering</b> can also refer to the use of a lighter barge for any form of short-distance transport, such as to bring railroad cars across a river. In addition, <b>lightering</b> can refer to the process of removing oil or other hazardous chemicals from a compromised vessel to another vessel to prevent oil from spilling into the surrounding waters.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States. {{the vast}} {{majority}} of fires caused by children are started with non-novelty <b>lighters</b> and matches (matches are the leading cause of fires started by children). [...] According to the National Association of Fire Marshals, despite attempts to collect statistical evidence concerning the prevalence of novelty lighter fires caused by children, only anecdotal evidence of such fires could be found. Thus, of the 3,168 fires caused by children playing with matches and <b>lighters</b> in 2004 in the United States, no cases were attributed to novelty <b>lighters</b> by the National Association of Fire Marshals. In one such anecdotal case, on September 25, 2007, two toddlers from Russellville, Arkansas, died after setting fire to their apartment with a motorcycle-shaped lighter that was imported illegally. Such tragic cases are often caused by <b>lighters</b> that lack proper child safety mechanisms as mandated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In the United States <b>lighters</b> must be child safe (children under 51 months must be unable to light the lighter with 100 children being used in testing). However, <b>lighters</b> manufactured at a cost higher than $2.50 {{do not have to be}} child safe. The <b>Lighter</b> Association, a lobbying organization pushing for the U.S. Congress to ban novelty <b>lighters,</b> draws its board members from Bic, Scripto, Swedish Match, and Calico Brands (four of the largest non-novelty lighter manufacturers). This constitutes a significant conflict of interest as non-novelty lighter manufacturers have a significant financial incentive to decrease competition from novelty lighter manufacturers despite the lack of statistical evidence that novelty <b>lighters</b> are more dangerous to children than non-novelty <b>lighters.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1888 {{the company}} {{expanded}} into dredging, where mechanisation led to greatly improved productivity, and secured {{a contract with}} the Port of London (PLA) to remove dredged ballast. This new venture was complementary to the existing business, utilising the barges already owned by the company, together with their knowledge of the river and its tides. There was a further synergy between <b>lightering</b> and dredging; <b>lightering</b> was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into port, whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to berth into port. The company’s move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to <b>lightering.</b> This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry bulk cargo after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of road haulage as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as Docklands) and shipping adopted containerisation methods. However, for the time being <b>lightering</b> still thrived and the New Zealand based Ashburton Guardian reported in 1890 that the Company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat. The newspaper noted that their capabilities for handling this cargo had been highlighted during a trip, organized for delegates at the International Congress on Inland Navigation, to inspect the company's custom built vessels complete with cold chambers that enabled the meat to arrive at Smithfield Market frozen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lightering</b> was practiced for {{all types}} of cargo for centuries. Prior to the 19th century {{introduction}} of steamships too large to enter some of the ports they intended to serve, in which case <b>lightering</b> became necessary to reduce the vessels' draft sufficiently to enter the port, cargoes ranging from water to ships's stores (food, livestock, misc. supplies), to gunpowder and shot, were carried from dockside to sailing ships moored in harbors and roadways. Dredging, advances in dock construction, and containerization have reduced the frequency of the practice in dry bulk shipping after the middle of the 20th century. However, the practice remains in common usage in the oil tanking industry ("wet" [...] cargo trade).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{industry}} center of <b>lighters</b> in Wenzhou, China, <b>lighters</b> {{are produced by}} {{a large number of}} small, vertically specialized, and agglomerated firms. Some firms specialize in assembling <b>lighters,</b> while the others specialize in producing parts. A perfect-competition model is developed to analyze this phenomenon, and four related factors are revealed to be involved. First, compared with standard factories, household workshops have the cost advantage in producing the parts of <b>lighters.</b> Next, <b>lighters</b> are produced by firms owned mostly by those transferring from peasants and other occupations. Due to the difficulty in financing, each of them focus on a specific component part of the product. Last, a large extent of market and agglomeration lead to low transaction costs. This makes it beneficial for the specialized firms to coordinate the production through the market. In the presence of the agglomeration effect in lowering the transaction costs, a perfectly competitive industry may have multiple equilibria. The ability of {{the industry}} of <b>lighters</b> in Wenzhou to expand to the high-level equilibrium by capturing the world market helps to explain the huge decreases in prices...|$|R
