25|$|Dor was an {{important}} salt production site, as attested to by pools and channels dug along the coast. Many shipwrecks have been discovered in the waters off Dor. Underwater exploration of a Byzantine wreck salvaged a medium-size boat constructed with iron nails. Based on coins recovered from the site, the boat dates to 665 CE, {{a decade after the}} Muslim conquest. Artifacts include several objects testifying to the practice of <b>light-fishing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{fisheries}} of Lake Albert {{have come}} under increasing focus due to several driving forces that have synergistically evolved resulting into concerns from diverse stakeholders. The driving forces include: the commercialization of the fisheries with entry into the value chain of industrial fish processing, a decline in fish stocks especially of the large-size fishes and the emergency of the light - fishing targeting small pelagic fishes. In addition, the assumption by some opinion leaders that <b>light-fishing</b> (use of light) has destroyed the Nile perch fishery of Lake Albert, other factors such as cross-border fishing conflicts, the emergence of oil, an influx of traders in fish-related activities, and the limited regulatory and enforcement regimes for the diverse commercially exploited fish fauna of Lake Albert all require continuous information and action...|$|E

The commercial fishery {{consists of a}} multinational jigging fleet, and the emission of light from these vessels can be observed using satellite-derived imagery obtained by the United States Defence Meteorological Satellite Program - Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), {{the location of the}} fleet (derived from DMSP-OLS data) was examined for the region 20 °N to 20 °S; 75 to 100 °W, covering {{the central part of the}} species' distribution. Satellite imagery of the <b>light-fishing</b> fleet revealed fishing grounds to be situated off the coast of Peru (2 to 10 °S), with fishing on the high seas observed off both Peru (3 to 18 °S), and Central America (5 to 10 °N). The distribution of the fleet was not associated with bathymetry or proximity to coastal regions, but is likely to be linked to upwelling events in the Eastern Pacific. DMSP-OLS data can be used to provide synoptic imagery of the fleet for time periods from a single day to several years, and enables the study of fleet activity across management and political boundaries...|$|E
