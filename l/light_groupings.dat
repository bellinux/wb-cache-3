50|$|The Rekord B {{can be seen}} as a {{cross-over}} {{model and}} an emergency response: Opel had originally intended to launch their all new generation of four cylinder engines in an all new Opel Rekord, but as the scheduled launch date approached it became clear that while the new engines would be ready for a 1965 launch, other key elements for the new models would not. With the marketing department and dealers geared up for a new model, the decision was therefore taken to present the new engines in what was essentially the old body, albeit with certain styling cues that adumbrated the new model that in the event would appear a year later. The Rekord B therefore featured the (then highly unusual) rectangular headlights that would be a feature of the 1966 Rekord C, as well as similar patterns of exterior chrome decoration. At the back the traditional rectangular <b>light</b> <b>groupings</b> of the Rekord A were, for the Rekord B, replaced with four bold round light units similar to those planned for the forthcoming Opel GT. The interior design and even the colour and trim options were only mildly modified for the Rekord B. Rekord Bs rolled down the Rüsselsheim production lines for rather less than a year between late Summer 1965 and mid Summer 1966. When, in August 1966, the plant restarted after the vacation shut down, the Rekord B had been replaced by the Rekord C.|$|E
25|$|Light clutter {{refers to}} {{excessive}} <b>groupings</b> of <b>lights.</b> <b>Groupings</b> of <b>lights</b> may generate confusion, distract from obstacles (including those {{that they may}} be intended to illuminate), and potentially cause accidents. Clutter is particularly noticeable on roads where the street lights are badly designed, or where brightly lit advertising surrounds the roadways. Depending on the motives of the person or organization that installed the lights, their placement and design can even be intended to distract drivers, and can contribute to accidents.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the design}} details, ultra lounge-style nightclubs may have subtly {{changing}} neon and vivid-colored <b>lights,</b> and seating <b>groupings</b> {{for people to}} socialize. Ultra lounge-style clubs sometimes create privacy around the seating areas with room dividers, sheets or curtains. Unlike most nightclubs, ultra lounges rarely have a separate dance floor. Some clubs have semi-private rooms with mattresses to lounge on and socialize. The music is often more subdued White-Room or ambient house-influenced music instead of uptempo dance music or techno. These clubs offer a range of cocktails and drinks, and sometimes serve bar food such as tapas-style finger food.|$|R
50|$|Unique sculptural creations for {{a single}} sites {{began to appear in}} 1998 (e.g., the 7 kW tree in Gleisdorf, Austria) or earlier. A number of {{variants}} of solar trees have been conceived, not all of them realized in installations. Locations have included roadways, public areas in cities, schools and universities, office buildings, science museums, and more. Recently, designers and manufacturers have introduced solar trees as products, designed to deliver the benefits of solar trees in a repeatable way to more places. Examples include Ross Lovegrove's solar tree which incorporated seating, <b>lighting,</b> and circular <b>groupings</b> of photovoltaic cells, Envision Solar solar parking canopy specifically trademarked Solar Tree, and Spotlight Solar's line of architectural structures and most recently CSIR’s Solar Power Tree from India.|$|R
50|$|The Harpsichord Concerto in C minor (K C17) {{exemplifies the}} {{transition}} from the Baroque to Galant style that took place throughout the 18th century. While this particular concerto demonstrates qualities from both styles, it tends more toward the modern. It is in three movements that follow the typical fast - slow - fast format of the Galant Concerti. Although the harmonic minor tonality and austere melody of the opening ritornello is reminiscent of Bach, the tone quickly turns sweeter with the entrance of the second theme. Typical of the Galant style, the harmony moves slowly with the underlying pulse carried by repeated eighth notes. The melodic content often consists of <b>light</b> flourishes in <b>groupings</b> of two or four measures, and the diatonic sequences are short and plain. The Baroque style most often emerges in the keyboard part with complex, chromatic, and virtuosic patterns. Furthermore, the counterpart between keyboard and orchestra is more intricate than what would be normally expected in the Galant style.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between body weight gain, nutrient intake, and skeletal and muscle growth in broiler breeder pullets was studied in two experiments. A total of 720 and 540 pullets were started in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In the first study, growing pullets were fed either a 15 % protein, 2, 885 kcal ME/kg pullet grower diet or a 23 % protein, 3, 133 kcal ME/kg broiler starter diet from 2 to 16 wk of age. Within each dietary treatment, {{there were three}} body weight <b>groupings</b> (<b>light,</b> control, heavy) achieved by manipulating weekly feed allowances. At 8, 12, and 16 wk of age, 12 pullets from each diet and body weight grouping were killed for muscle [pectoralis major] and skeletal (shank, keel, tibia, clavicle) measurements. As body weight increased, so did skeletal growth, {{but there were no}} significant differences in skeletal measurements related to diet. At 12 and 16 wk of age, pullets fed the broiler starter diet had significantly larger p. major muscles. In Experiment 2, growing pullets were fed restricted diets: 1) the 15 % protein grower diet (control), 2) the broiler starter diet adjusted weekly to the same calculated calorie intake as that obtained with the grower diet (broiler starter calorie), or 3) the broiler starter diet adjusted to the same calculated protein intake as the grower ration (broiler starter protein). At 16 wk, {{there were no significant differences}} between body weight or skeletal measurements of the control and broiler starter calorie treatments. Pullets in the broiler starter calorie treatment did have significantly larger pectoralis muscles and less abdominal fat than those fed the 15 % grower diet. Pullets in the broiler starter protein treatment were significantly lighter and had shorter bones, less abdominal fat, and smaller p. major muscles than those in the control treatment.
