5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, <b>lithium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E

40|$|The {{conformation}} of 36 kDa {{polyethylene oxide}} (PEO) dissolved in three glyme–Li⁺ solvate ionic liquids (SILs) {{has been investigated}} by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and rheology {{as a function of}} concentration and compared to a previously studied SIL. The solvent quality of a SIL for PEO can be tuned by changing the glyme length and anion type. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that PEO is dissolved in the SILs through Li⁺–PEO coordinate bonds. All SILs (lithium triglyme bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide ([Li(G 3) ]TFSI), lithium tetraglyme bis(pentafluoroethanesulfonyl) imide ([Li(G 4) ]BETI), <b>lithium</b> tetraglyme <b>perchlorate</b> ([Li(G 4) ]ClO₄) and the recently published [Li(G 4) ]TFSI) are found to be moderately good solvents for PEO but solvent quality decreases in the order [Li(G 4) ]TFSI ∼ [Li(G 4) ]BETI > [Li(G 4) ]ClO₄ > [Li(G 3) ]TFSI due to decreased availability of Li⁺ for PEO coordination. For the same glyme length, the solvent qualities of SILs with TFSI⁻ and BETI⁻ anions ([Li(G 4) ]TFSI and [Li(G 4) ]BETI) are very similar because they weakly coordinate with Li⁺, which facilitates Li⁺–PEO interactions. [Li(G 4) ]ClO₄ presents a poorer solvent environment for PEO than [Li(G 4) ]BETI because ClO₄⁻ binds more strongly to Li⁺ and thereby hinders interactions with PEO. [Li(G 3) ]TFSI is the poorest PEO solvent of these SILs because G 3 binds more strongly to Li⁺ than G 4. Rheological and radius of gyration (R g) data as a function of PEO concentration show that the PEO overlap concentrations, c* and c**, are similar in the three SILs...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{intensity of the}} infrared band associated with water libration has been examined for the <b>perchlorates</b> <b>lithium,</b> sodium and ammonium. Well developed concentration dependent isosbestic points are evident indicating a two species equilibrium.

There has been a large number of spectroscopic studies devoted to electrolyte solutions and the interactions between water and the dissolved.

50|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> is {{also used}} as an {{electrolyte}} in lithium-ion batteries. <b>Lithium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> is chosen over alternative electrolytes such as lithium hexafluorophosphate or lithium tetrafluoroborate when its superior electrical impedance, conductivity, hygroscopicity, and anodic stability properties are of importance to the specific application. However, these beneficial properties are often overshadowed by the electrolyte's strong oxidizing properties, making the electrolyte reactive toward its solvent at high temperatures and/or high current loads. Due to these hazards the battery is often considered unfit for industrial applications.|$|E

The igniter is struck by a firing pin when the device is activated. One cartridge releases 600 L of oxygen and burns for 5-20 minutes at 450 - 500 C.

50|$|The basic setup in electrosynthesis is a {{galvanic}} cell, a potentiostat and two electrodes. Good electrosynthetic conditions use {{a solvent}} and electrolyte combination that minimizes electrical resistance. Protic conditions often use alcohol-water or dioxane-water solvent mixtures with an electrolyte {{such as a}} soluble salt, acid or base. Aprotic conditions often use an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or dichloromethane with electrolytes such as <b>lithium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> or tetrabutylammonium acetate. Electrodes are selected which provide favorable electron transfer properties towards the substrate while maximizing the activation energy for side reactions. This activation energy is often related to an overpotential of a competing reaction. For example, in aqueous conditions the competing reactions in the cell are the formation of oxygen at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. In this case a graphite anode and lead cathode could be used effectively because of their high overpotentials for oxygen and hydrogen formation respectively. Many other materials {{can be used as}} electrodes. Other examples include platinum, magnesium, mercury (as a liquid pool in the reactor), stainless steel or reticulated vitreous carbon. Some reactions use a sacrificial electrode which is consumed during the reaction like zinc or lead. The two basic cell types are undivided cell or divided cell type. In divided cells the cathode and anode chambers are separated with a semiporous membrane. Common membrane materials include sintered glass, porous porcelain, polytetrafluoroethene or polypropylene. The purpose of the divided cell is to permit the diffusion of ions while restricting the flow of the products and reactants. This is important when unwanted side reactions are possible. An example of a reaction requiring a divided cell is the reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine, where the latter chemical is susceptible to oxidation at the anode.|$|E
50|$|Organosilanes {{are used}} to reduce {{alcohols}} to alkanes {{in the presence of}} a strong Lewis acid. Brønsted acids may also be used, although cationic, skeletal rearrangements, and nucleophilic attack of the conjugate base on the carbocation may be problematic. The rate of reduction increases with increasing substitution at the alcohol carbon—tertiary alcohols undergo facile reduction with boron trifluoride etherate but primary alcohols require an excess of the silane, a stronger Lewis acid, and longer reaction times.Allylic alcohols may be deoxygenated in the presence of tertiary alcohols when ethereal <b>lithium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> is employed.Reductions of alkyl halides and triflates give poorer yields in general than reductions of alcohols. A Lewis acid, typically aluminium(III) chloride or bromide, is required regardless of the substitution pattern of the alkyl halide. Benzyl halides may be reduced with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in high yield.Hydrosilanes are particularly useful for the reduction of 1,1-disubstituted double bonds, which form stable tertiary carbocations upon protonation. Trisubstituted double bonds may be reduced selectively in the presence of 1,2-disubstituted or monosubstituted alkenes.Notably, aromatic compounds may be reduced with TFA and triethylsilane. Substituted furans are reduced to tetrahydrofuran derivatives in high yield.Esters may be reduced to alcohols under conditions of nucleophilic activation with caesium or potassium fluoride.Aldehydes undergo hydrosilylation in the presence of hydrosilanes and fluoride. The resulting silyl ethers can be hydrolyzed with 1 M hydrochloric acid. Optimal yields of the hydrosilylation are obtained when the reaction is carried out in very polar solvents.Acetals, ketals, and aminals are reduced in the presence of hydrosilanes and acid. Site-selective reduction of acetals and ketals whose oxygens are inequivalent have been reported—the example below is used in a synthesis of Tamiflu.Other functional groups that have been reduced with hydrosilanes include amides, α,β-unsaturated amides, and α,β-unsaturated esters enamines, imines, and azides.|$|E
