40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of applying single-scan airborne, static terrestrial and mobile <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> for improving the accuracy of tree height growth measurement. Specifically, compared to the traditional works on forest growth inventory with airborne <b>laser</b> <b>scanning,</b> two issues are regarded: “Can the new technique characterize the height growth for each individual tree?” and “Can this technique refine the minimum growth-discernable temporal interval further?” To solve these two puzzles, the sampling principles of the three <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> modes were first examined, and their error sources against the task of tree-top capturing were also analyzed. Next, the three-year growths of 58 Nordic maple trees (Crimson King) for test were intermittently surveyed with one type of <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> each time and then analyzed by statistics. The evaluations show that the height growth of each individual tree still cannot be reliably characterized even by single-scan terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning,</b> and statistical analysis is necessary in this scenario. After Gaussian regression, {{it is found that}} the minimum temporal interval with distinguishable tree height growths can be refined into one month based on terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning,</b> far better than the two years deduced in the previous works based on airborne <b>laser</b> <b>scanning.</b> The associated mean growth was detected to be about 0. 12 m. Moreover, the parameter of tree height generally under-estimated by airborne and even mobile <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> can be relatively revised by means of introducing static terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> data.

Although numerous commercial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscopes exist, some of the more interesting and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition hardware and writing the complex software required to run the <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscope. Results We describe a simple, software-based approach to operating a <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscope without the need for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control of <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> are achieved through standard data acquisition boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality. Conclusions We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscope that allows easy custom design. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Data {{registration}} {{is a prerequisite}} for the integration of multi-platform <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> in various applications. A new approach is proposed for the semi-automatic registration of airborne and terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> data with buildings without eaves. Firstly, an automatic calculation procedure for thresholds in density of projected points (DoPP) method is introduced to extract boundary segments from terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> data. A new algorithm, using a self-extending procedure, is developed to recover the extracted boundary segments, which then intersect to form the corners of buildings. The building corners extracted from airborne and terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> are reliably matched through an automatic iterative process in which boundaries from two datasets are compared for the reliability check. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach provides both high reliability and high geometric accuracy (average error of 0. 44 m/ 0. 15 m in horizontal/vertical direction for corresponding building corners) for the final registration of airborne <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> (ALS) and tripod mounted terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> (TLS) data...|$|R

40|$|Aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> (lidar) {{has become}} a widely used {{technique}} for spatial data production. Although various rigorous error models of aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> already exist and examples of a-posteriori studies of aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> data accuracies verified with field-work {{can be found in}} the literature, a simple measure to define a-priori error sizes is not available. In this work the aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> error contributions are described in detail: the basic systematic error sources, the flight-mission-related error sources and the target-characteristic-related error sources. A review of the different error-source sizes is drawn from the literature in order to define the boundary conditions for each error size. Schenk’s geolocation equation is used as a basis for deriving a simplified a-priori error model. By changing different geometrical parameters the simulation of error sizes is made and the influence of different error sources is studied. This simplified error model enables a quick calculation and gives a-priori plausible values for the average and maximum error size, independent of the scan and heading angles as well as being independent of any specific aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> system’s characteristics. Spatial data production by aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> is also limited by acquisition precision. The acquisition precision is defined by spatial data products (in our case: geodetic data for local spatial planning). The acquisition precision of spatial data products also defines the minimum point density of aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning.</b> The minimum point density when applying aerial <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> as a stand-alone-technique is defined through minimal sampling density or Nyquist frequency. Through measuring penetration rate for different vegetation classes in the test area the total usable point density is defined.
