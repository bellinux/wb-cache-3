A building owner will want to claim as much as he can to cover the loss resulted from the delay of completion. The objectives of this research are to identify the basis in ascertaining the amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> and ascertain whether the amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> is a reasonable compensation or not. There are elements of cost from nine articles tabulated in a table to create a basis in ascertaining the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> amount. Twenty elements of cost found and they were divided into major and minor costs. There are seven elements under the major cost and the rest were classified as minor cost. The major costs are financing interest, loss of profit, professional fee, administrative cost, alternative facilities, supervision fees and overhead. Three public projects and two private projects were analysed to ascertain whether the amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> were reasonable or not. As a result, the amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> in public project appears to be reasonable as it is less than the amount of losses suffered. In private projects, the amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> is unreasonable as the amount is more than the losses suffered and can be challenged as penalty by the contractor...|$|R

The clause will be enforceable if it involves a genuine attempt to quantify a loss in advance and is a good faith estimate of economic loss.

One explanation is that sellers can undergo changes in production costs which generate an option value of waiting.

Next, we analyze the effects of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> aimed at protecting the buyer for the expected losses due to project delays. We show that when the expectation measure fails to discourage time overruns, a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> stipulation does not lead to a Pareto superior outcome.

40|$|Wage and hour {{cases are}} common in New York, yet courts {{calculate}} damages inconsistently when plaintiffs pursue their unpaid wages under both federal and state law. Overlapping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the New York Labor Law both authorize private actions for the recovery of certain unpaid wages, and each also provides an additional 100 percent of the unpaid wages as <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> unless the employer establishes a good-faith defense. Given these similarities, New York wage and hour cases regularly flirt with the double recovery doctrine, which prevents plaintiffs from receiving duplicative awards. Historically, courts in the Second Circuit have been split over whether awarding both sets of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> offends double recovery. An old New York statute authorized only 25 percent of the unpaid wages as <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> and allowed them only if an employee could demonstrate that the employer’s violation was willful. Based upon the old law’s scienter requirement and upon its legislative history, courts considered the state provision punitive in purpose, {{as opposed to the}} federal provision, which is compensatory. Consequently, some courts reasoned that because each provision served a different purpose, the awards were not duplicative. Others disagreed. Although the New York Labor Law’s current <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> provision bears little resemblance to its predecessor, some courts continue to apply analyses of the old statute to the new one. This Note analyzes the effects that amendments enacted in 2009 and 2010 should have upon the preexisting split and contends that neither the current statutory text nor its legislative history conclusively supports characterizing the state provision exclusively as either compensatory or punitive. Instead, the evidence suggests a dual purpose. Since the awards overlap, courts can only avoid double recovery by awarding one set of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages...</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{virtue of}} the Customs Courts Act of 1980 (the 2 ̆ 21980 Act 2 ̆ 2), 2 ̆ 7 the U. S.

This Article shall concentrate upon five of the claims and defenses considered by the CIT and the U. S.

Whether the assessment of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> is a protestable decision within the meaning of 19 U. S. C. § 1514 (a), and if so, whether the failure to protest within ninety days of the demand for damages precludes the challenging of the assessment of those damages as a defense to a collection suit by the U. S. government. 2. Whether the event that commences the running of the statute of limitations in suits to recover <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> for breach of the bond is the date of the actual breach, or the date of the mailing of the demand for payment of the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages.</b> 3. Whether liquidation of an entry affects the bond obligations of an importer and surety in a suit based upon failure to timely redeliver, export or destroy foodstuffs and/or motor vehicles. Whether <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> assessed for breach of a bond function as a penalty for purposes of the statute of limita- tions and/or the awarding of prejudgment interest. 5.

40|$|The {{construction}} of the Benzal Bridge over the White River in rural Arkansas brought about years of litigation between Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and contractor San Ore-Gardner, the crux of which was whether the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> provision in the parties 2 ̆ 7 contract was enforceable. The <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> provision at issue provided that San Ore-Gardner would be liable to Missouri Pacific Railroad Company for damages {{in the amount of}} 600 per day if performance of the contract was not completed within the specified time period. Although Missouri Pacific Railroad Company did contribute to the over two year delay in completion of the Benzal Bridge Project, the evidence showed that its responsibility was far less than that of San Ore-Gardner. The Eighth Circuit held that any act contributing to the failure to meet contractual deadlines, regardless of whether the levels of the parties fault was disproportionate, prevented enforcement of the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> provision. This note argues that the Eighth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding {{is one of the worst}} things to happen to Arkansas construction law in the last thirty years. Not only are <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions a fundamental principal to freedom of contract, but <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions also allow courts to award an identifiable amount of damages that were bargained for by the parties and would otherwise be difficult to determine in litigation. Courts are split on the issue of enforcement of a damage provision when the party seeking enforcement contributed to the breach. Traditionally, courts would not allow enforcement in such a situation. However, modern courts follow the apportionment rule, where the court will apportion fault and enforce the damage provision in accordance with the parties 2 ̆ 7 corresponding levels of fault. The background section of this note considers the development of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> law, including the historical backgrounds which lead to parties bargaining for remedies in the event of a breach of contract, the current state of the law regarding <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions, and development of the apportionment rule. Next, the note considers problems faced by jurisdictions opposing the apportionment rule. In particular, the traditional rule contravenes public policy (as found in a state 2 ̆ 7 s constitution and statutory scheme) in states that have enacted portions of the Uniform Commercial Code and comparative fault statutes that operate comparatively to the apportionment theory. Further, not applying the apportionment rule infringes on the parties 2 ̆ 7 freedom to contract and in turn prolongs litigation in ascertaining the proper award of damages. In conclusion, the note proposes that the modern approach 2 ̆ 7 s apportionment rule is supported by Arkansas public policy and should be expressly adopted by Arkansas courts...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper examines {{the issue of}} whether United States courts demonstrate a trend in preference for when in time the intent test is applied in ascertaining the validity of a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> clause. Judicial opinions dating from 1853 to 1991 formalize the study population. Retrieval of judicial opinions are from official and unofficial legal reporters for the United States. Of the 223 selected appellate court cases, 175 met the population parameters. Data derived from these judicial opinions were statistically tested by: (a) the chi-square test for binomial data, and (b) the Stuart-Cox sign test for trend analysis. Results of the chi-square test reveal that at present the courts demonstrate a preference for applying the intent test at the time of contract when construing the validity of a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> clause.
