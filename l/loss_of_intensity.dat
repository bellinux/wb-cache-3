A photoelectric cell collects the light which passes through the cuvette. A measurement is then given for the amount of absorbed light.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Elliptical centric contrast-enhanced MR {{angiography}} of the cervical vasculature is {{a well-established}} technique {{that in many}} practices has replaced conventional angiography for several clinical indications, including atherosclerotic disease and dissections. Occasionally blurring or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>intensity</b> occurs in the vertebral arteries, especially in young patients with rapid circulation times. This ringing artifact, which we termed “feathering, ” results from rapidly changing signal intensity in small vascular structures during the sampling {{of the center of}} k-space. Elliptical centric contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiographyis a well-established technique that in many practices has replaced conventional digital subtraction angiography for the preoperative evaluation of carotid occlusive disease and cervi-cal arterial dissection. 1 A commonly recognized artifact result-ing in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>intensity</b> in the vessel is the presence of surgical clips following endarterectomy. 2 The resulting mag-netic field distortion may result in signal intensity loss in both the carotid and vertebral arteries.

50|$|In Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance {{the introduction of}} the paramagnetic group increases the relaxation rate of nearby nuclei. Its presence can be detected as peak broadening and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> in peaks corresponding to nearby nuclei. Hence proximity can be inferred for all nuclei, that are affected. A major advantage of this method over traditional methods for obtaining distance restraints in protein NMR is the increased length, as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement can detect distances up to 25 Å (2.5 nm) as opposed to about 6 Å (0.6 nm) using the nuclear Overhauser effect. Spin labelling with MTSL is frequently used in investigation of residual structure in intrinsically unstructured proteins.|$|E

40|$|FTIR and Infrared {{emission}} spectroscopy (IES) {{has been used}} to characterise the Uley (Australian) and Garfield nontronites. These clay minerals are characterised by a strong emission band at 3570 cm- 1 attributed to the FeFeOH unit. Dehydroxylation is followed by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> of this band as a function of temperature. Dehydroxylation is also followed by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> of the FeFeOH deformation vibration at 843 cm- 1. IES shows that the dehydroxylation occurs as a continuous process in comparison to DTA/TGA studies where the dehydroxylation occurs abruptly at 425 °C. Water in these high iron bearing smectites have been observed through the stretching mode at 3430 cm- 1 and the 2 bending mode at 1630 cm- 1. Different types of water are identified in the nontronite structure by the analysis of the band profile in the 1590 to 1680 cm- 1 region. Low frequency vibrations show that the Uley green nontronite is similar to the Garfield nontronite. The brown Uley nontronite is closer to the Hohen-Hagen nontronite. The Uley nontronites may therefore be used spectroscopically to replace other nontronites as a reference clay mineral...|$|E

Indications for adrenalectomy of nonfunctional adrenal lesions included > 6  cm in size and ≤ 6  cm in size with atypical characteristics on MRI. Lesions with a size of > 6  cm, local invasion, irregular margins, and chemical-shift imaging that demonstrated no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>intensity</b> on out-of-phase images were considered suspected of malignancy. ResultsAdrenal lesions of > 6  cm in size exhibited an 80 -fold increased prediction of malignancy (OR:  80;  95 % CI 7. 8 – 813), whereas irregular margins and local invasion exhibited a 45 -fold (OR: 45; 95 % CI 6. 4 – 312. 5) and a 12 -fold (OR: 12; 95 % CI 4. 6 – 30. 6) increased occurrence of malignancy, respectively. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>intensity</b> {{did not affect the}} prediction of malignancy.

Of the remaining 16 animals, 6 were bleached once and 10 were bleached twice. One maxillary and one mandibular incisor were bleached in each jaw with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide and heat for ten minutes per tooth; the other incisors were protected with a rubber dam. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last bleach. The fluorescent <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> 374 select ground sections 100 ± 5 microns thick from the incisal, middle and gingival thirds of the teeth were measured with an ultraviolet light microscope coupled to a television electronic measurement system.

The dentin of tetracycline-stained maxillary incisors which were bleached twice and the dentin in the incisal one-third of the mandibular incisors which were bleached twice had a significantly (P ≤ 0. 001, P ≤ 0. 005) lower tetracycline fluorescent intensity than the dentin of unbleached tetracycline-stained teeth. The greatest <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fluorescent <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> tetracycline occurred in dentin closest to the dentino-enamel junction and varied from about 150 to 350 microns from the outer enamel surface.

40|$|Due to the {{individual}} steps of manufacturing various kinds of residual stresses and strains are induced in devices and components of microsystems. Often these residual stress states differ considerably from those determined in well known conventional materials and materials compounds.

X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool also for the investigation of the residual stress states in microsystems, because it enables the non-destructive testing of materials and components and the investigation of very small measurement volumes. Due to the small thickness of the single layers in multi-layered microsystems the X-rays penetrate in many cases the samples deeply and diffraction patterns of different materials layers occur.
