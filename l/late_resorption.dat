40|$|Restoration of lost bone {{support and}} joint {{stability}} {{are the primary}} challenges in revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, the defects type 2 B and type 3 are associated with several damaged metaphyseal bone and loss of cortical bone. Structural allografts {{have been used for}} the treatment of large, contained, or uncontained osseous defect in revision TKA. Disadvantages Of Using Structural allografts include <b>late</b> <b>resorption</b> or nonunion and Fisk of disease transmission. Alone, the Structural allograft can not provide the initial support for revision implants. In these cases the stems are frequently used to provide the necessary load sharing and increase initial component stability. When evaluating whether stems should be cemented or press-fit, there isn't a simple answer, since there are no clear advantages or disadvantages for each approach. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate load sharing and stability at bone graft-cement interface under femoral component with use of cemented and press-fit stems after allograft incorporation with host bone. The difficulties encountered or the impossibility on the evaluation of these biomechanical parameters in-vitro make the use of finite element (FE) models a way through this evaluation. The FE results suggest that a press-fit stem could be the adequate choice if structural allografts in femur revision are used. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} at Emory University Affiliated Hospitals with transplantation {{of the greater}} omentum as a free revascularized graft in 18 patients is presented. In each instance, there was realization of the therapeutic objective, either 1) the amelioration of congenital or acquired somatic deformity (14 patients) or 2) the control of infection (4 patients). Because the omentum is a syncytium of blood vessels and a variable amount of fat within redundant leaves of peritoneal membrane laden with macrophages, it is a tissue that serves admirably its extended role as an extracelomic free transplant. The greater omentum {{has been used for}} this purpose in five patients with hemifacial atrophy (Romberg's disease); three patients with hemifacial microsomia (first and second branchial arch syndrome); two patients with extensive losses of the maxilla, palate, and face due to a shotgun blast; two patients with atrophy and facial growth arrest due to x-irradiation; and two patients with deformity of the jaw and neck following tumor resection. In three additional patients, the omentum was used to obliterate the dead space after debridement of an infected open frontal sinus following failure of conventional therapy. In one instance, a revascularized free graft of omentum was used to salvage a patient with an exposed irradiated carotid artery graft and skin flap failure following radical neck dissection. In these 18 patients, there were no intra-abdominal complications consequent to harvest of the omentum. In one patient afflicted with hemifacial atrophy, there was spotty necrosis of the overlying attenuated facial skin flap and limited fat necrosis. In the follow-up period of four months to seven years, there has been no instance of <b>late</b> <b>resorption.</b> The method is reliable and has considerable promise in reconstructive surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} toxicity of acetyl cedrene (AC), a widely used fragrance ingredient, was evaluated in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (25 /group). Gavaged dosages of 0 (corn oil), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day were administered on days 7 through 17 of gestation (GDs 7 to 17). First and last day dosing suspensions were analyzed for AC content. All rats were observed daily for viability, clini-cal signs, abortions, and premature deliveries. Body weights were recorded at frequent intervals. Cesarean-sectioning and necropsy examinations {{were performed on}} GD 21. Uteri were examined for number and distribution of implantations, live and dead fetuses, and early and <b>late</b> <b>resorptions.</b> The number of corpora lutea in each ovary was also recorded. Fetuses were weighed and examined for gender and gross external changes and soft tissue or skeletal alterations.

40|$|Alpha-iso-methylionone, {{a widely}} used {{fragrance}} ingredient, was evaluated for developmental toxicity in presumed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (25 /group). Oral dosages of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day alpha-iso-methylionone in corn oil were administered by gavage on gestational days 7 to 17. The presence of spermatozoa and/or a copulatory plug in situ was designated as gestational day. Rats were observed for viability, clinical signs, body weights, and feed consumption. Caesarean sectioning and necropsy occurred on gestational day 21. Uteri were examined for number and distri-bution of implantations, live and dead fetuses, and early and <b>late</b> <b>resorptions.</b> Numbers of corpora lutea were also recorded. Fetuses were weighed and examined for gender, gross external changes, and soft tissue or skeletal alterations. No maternal or fetal deaths occurred. No fragrance ingredient–related clinical signs were ob-served. Feed consumption, body weight gains, gross tissue changes at necropsy, and caesarean section or litter parameters, {{as well as}} fetal developmental morphology, were unaffected by dosages of alpha-iso-methylionone as high as 30 mg/kg/day. Based on these data, maternal and developmental no observed adverse effect levels of {{equal to or greater}} than 30 mg/kg/day were established for alpha-iso-methylionone. It is concluded that alpha-iso-methylionone is not a developmental toxicant in rats at maternal doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day...|$|R
40|$|The embryotoxicity/teratogenicity of {{neohesperidin dihydrochalcone}} (NHDC) was {{examined}} in Wistar Crl:(WI) WU BR rats. NHDC was fed at dietary concentrations of 0, 1. 25, 2. 5 or 5 {{to groups of}} 28 mated female rats from day 0 to 21 of gestation. At Cesarean section 25, 22, 23, and 23 rats {{were found to be}} pregnant in the control, low-, mid-, and high-dose group, respectively. The NHDC treatment was well tolerated and all animals survived till the end of the study. Body weights (bw) and body weight gains did not differ between controls and NHDC treatment groups. The intake of NHDC was 0. 8 - 0. 9, 1. 6 - 1. 7, and 3. 1 - 3. 4 g/kg bw/day for the low-, mid-, and high-dose group, respectively. Except for cecal enlargement, there were no changes observed at necropsy which could be related to the NHDC treatment. All dams had viable fetuses. The fecundity and gestation index, the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live and dead fetuses, early and <b>late</b> <b>resorptions,</b> pre- and post-implantation losses, and sex-ratio were not affected by the treatment. There were no differences for the mean weight of the gravid and empty uterus, ovaries, and placenta between the NHDC treatment groups and the controls. Examination of the fetuses for external, visceral, and skeletal changes did not reveal any fetotoxic, embryotoxic or teratogenic effects of NHDC. In conclusion, no adverse effects were observed at NHDC levels of up to 5 % of the diet, the highest dose level tested, at which the rats consumed about 3. 3 g/kg body weight/day. The observed cecal enlargement is a well-known physiological, adaptive response to the ingestion of high doses of a low-digestible substance and is generally accepted to lack toxicological relevance. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Plant lignan 7 -hydromatairesinol, a novel {{precursor}} of the mammalian lignan enterolactone was evaluated in a prenatal developmental toxicity study {{conducted in the}} Wistar rat. Mated female rats were fed diets containing 0, 0. 25, 1, and 4 % (w/w) of 7 -hydroxymatairesinol {{in the form of}} potassium acetate complex (HMRlignan; potassium acetate level approximately 20 % w/w within the preparation) for days 0 - 21 of gestation. Test substance intake was calculated to be 0. 14 - 0. 18, 0. 46 - 0. 74, and 1. 19 - 2. 93 g/kg body weight/day for the low, mid, and high-dose groups, respectively. The rats were sacrificed on day 21 of the gestation period and examined for standard parameters of reproductive performance (fecundity index, gestation index, number of corpora lutea, number of implantations, pre- and post-implantation loss, number of early- and <b>late</b> <b>resorptions,</b> number of live- and dead fetuses, sex-ration and the weight of the reproductive organs). The fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations. The results from this study showed no effects on reproductive performance or any treatment related findings following external, visceral, and skeletal examination of the fetuses. However, approximately half of the mated dams of the high-dose failed to thrive due to an unexpected large decrease in their food intake, and were sacrificed early. Body weights of the remaining animals of the high-dose group were decreased. Food consumption was decreased in all treatment groups during the first three days of the gestation period as a result of decreased palatability of the feed. In conclusion, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for maternal effects was 1 %, whereas the NOEL for fetal development following daily oral HMRlignan administration throughout the gestation was equivalent to 4 % in the diet. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the potential embryo-fetal toxicity and toxicokinetics of the anti-malarial agent artesunate (ARTS) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnant rats were administered ARTS daily from gestational day 6 ~ 15 via oral gavage, at test doses of 0, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg (22 females per group). The fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities on gestational day 20. With regard to the dams, there were no deaths, treatment-related clinical signs, changes in body weight, or food intake in any of the treatment groups. There were no treatment-related gross findings at necropsy in any treat-ment group. In the 8 mg/kg group, there was a decrease in gravid uterine weight and in the weight of female fetuses. There was also an increase in fetal deaths (primarily <b>late</b> <b>resorptions)</b> and an increase in post-implantation losses (37 %) at 8 mg/kg. An increase in the incidence of visceral and skeletal variations at 4 and 8 mg/kg was observed. These defects included minor changes in the appearance of the kidney and thymus, as well as absent ribs or thoracic vertebrae. Toxicokinetics were assessed in a parallel study, using 4 mated females per group. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the con-centration of ARTS and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were quantified in plasma from rats on gestational days 5, 6, 10, and 15. Amniotic fluid was assayed for ARTS and DHA on gestational day 15. There was evidence of rapid conversion of ARTS to the metabolite DHA in maternal plasma, since ARTS could not be consistently detected in plasma at the three doses tested. ARTS and DHA were not detected in amniotic fluid at gestational day 15, indicating limited placental transfer of the two agents. The embryo-fetal no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of the test item was considered to be 8 mg/kg/day for dams, and 2 mg/kg/day for embryo-fetal development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Chapada Diamantina, {{located in}} the central region of the State of Bahia, is of {{important}} historical significance due to its diamond occurrences. Discovered in the nineteenth century, comprehensive research about the regional diamonds and their origins are still limited, demanding more investigation in the matter. Looking for insights about their genesis, mineral inclusions in 23 alluvial diamonds from 4 garimpos {{located in the}} Chapada Diamantina were analyzed {{through the use of}} Raman micro spectroscopy. Additionally, the characteristics of nitrogen aggregation of the host diamonds were measured using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The diamonds from Chapada Diamantina consist mainly of well-formed crystals, with dominant dodecahedral habits, characterized by faint to very light yellow body colors, typically with green and brown radiation spots on their surface. The main surface textures observed are related to processes {{that took place in the}} <b>late</b> stage <b>resorption</b> and during the residence of the diamonds in placer environments. The diamonds are predominantly type IaAB, with a significant occurrence of poorly aggregated nitrogen (Type IaA diamond). The main mineral assemblages of the studied peridotitic inclusions refer to a harzburgitic paragenesis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSize, {{caloric value}} and {{chemical}} composition were measured separately in the progeny of two northern pike (Esox lucius) females at 3 -day intervals during the endogenous feeding period from hatching to final yolk resorption. Tissue, yolk and entire larvae were analysed separately in {{three groups of}} larvae that hatched at different times (between 88 and 106 degree-days post-fertilization). An integrated approach with the Gompertz model was used to compute the yolk conversion efficiency and time to maximum tissue size in early, mid and late hatched larvae. At hatching, unresorbed yolk of early hatched larvae contained more energy (39. 20 J) and more protein (0. 99 mg) compared to the yolk of larvae that hatched later (38. 13 J and 0. 92 mg protein for late hatched larvae, p < 0. 05). In contrast, {{a significant reduction in}} tissue weight (- 0. 7 mg DW) and protein content (- 0. 5 mg) was found in early hatched larvae compared to those which hatched later (p < 0. 05). Between days 9 and 12 post-hatching (108 and 144 degree-days post-hatching), close to the final yolk <b>resorption,</b> <b>late</b> hatched larvae stopped growing and their tissue began to be resorbed. This tissue resorption time was delayed in early hatched larvae which presented {{at the end of the}} experiment a greater tissue weight than late hatched ones. Yolk conversion efficiency in term of energy from hatching to complete yolk resorption stage was significantly higher for early and mid hatched larvae (51 %) compared to late hatched ones (44 %) (p = 0. 004). Furthermore, the time to maximum tissue size was found to be negatively related to hatching time which implies that early hatched larvae take longer time to switch from one developmental stage to the next. The maximum tissue dry weight and energy content were found to be reached at approximately the same age post-fertilization for both early hatched and late hatched larvae, suggesting that the principal steps in a fish's lifespan are better correlated with time of fertilization than hatching time...|$|R
40|$|PGE {{mineralization}} {{has been}} identified in various rock types and at various stratigraphic levels in layered intrusions of any age, size and magmatic lineage, {{but the most important}} deposits occur as relatively narrow stratiform reefs in the lower to central ultramafic–mafic portions of large tholeiitic intrusions of late Archean to early Proterozoic age. One of the main challenges in exploration is that the reefs tend to be sulfide-poor. In many chromitites, magnetitites and silicate-hosted ores, the rocks contain no visible sulfides, possibly due to (<b>late)</b> magmatic sulfide <b>resorption.</b> As a result, some deposits may have been overlooked, particularly those in the upper portions of the intrusions that were in the past considered to be relatively unprospective. Amongst lithogeochemical tools, Cu/Pd ratios have proven to be particularly useful to evaluate the PGE potential of intrusions and to delineate the position of the reefs within the intrusions. The origin of the PGE mineralization remains controversial. A possible explanation for the low sulfide contents of many PGE-rich intrusions is that most of their parental magmas were strongly undersaturated in sulfur and at least partially derived from the S-poor and PGE-enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Sulfide saturation upon emplacement in the crust may have been reached during differentiation. Empirical evidence supports theoretical considerations that chromite and magnetite precipitation may be particularly conducive to trigger sulfide melt saturation, due to a pronounced decrease in FeO content of the magma. The importance of magma mixing in triggering sulfide supersaturation remains unclear. The same applies to contamination; some intrusions show a distinct crustal component, but many others do not, and there is little if any correlation between sulfide content and crustal component. Together with the general paucity of sulfides in the intrusions this could suggest that contamination is not critical in reef formation and may indeed be a negative factor. Other processes may also be relevant to reef formation. Data from the well-studied Bushveld Complex suggest that the magmas had reached sulfide saturation prior to emplacement, and that sulfides were entrained in the magma during ascent and emplacement. Sulfide entrainment has previously been recognised as one of the key factors in the formation of massive Ni–Cu sulfide deposits, and it is suggested here that it is also relevant to the formation of PGE deposits...|$|R
