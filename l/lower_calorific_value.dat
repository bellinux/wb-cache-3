50|$|The {{quantity}} {{known as}} {{lower heating value}} (LHV) (net calorific value (NCV) or <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> (LCV)) is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water vapor from the higher heating value.

The current installed capacity of coal-fired power plants is around 167  GW, which {{accounts for more than}} 60  % of the total installed capacity (CEA 2015 a, b). The larger availability and subsidized costing of coal in India plays a major role for the domination of coal based power in India. The increase in the pricing of power grade coal at <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> is quite low. For example, the cost of coal increases from INR 620 /t for the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of 3100  kcal/kg coal to only INR 630 /t for 4000  kcal/kg coal (Sen and Sarkar 2012). Recently, a large number of larger power plants have been coming up, including the ultra-mega power plants (UMPPs), which are super-critical power plants of around 4  GW. It is projected that between 2005 and 2030, the coal-fired power capacity will be added to the tune of 150  GW (Nair et al. 2003). The older power plants in India are characterized by lower efficiency and higher emission and coal consumption rates (Kapila and Haszeldine 2009). Such plants may be refurbished or retrofitted with modern equipment to reduce the emissions and resource consumption levels. Also, for such plants a concrete renovation and modernization programme has been taken up to 2016 – 2017 (CEA 2009). Another recent feature is the setting up of super-critical units. Such units are being commissioned in the capacity of 660 and 800  MW (CEA 2013 a, b). Commissioning of super critical plants has been put on more emphasis so as to improve the conversion efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint.|$|R

40|$|Gases {{with a low}} <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> (LCV) are {{produced}} by many different processes, both natural and industrial. They are released from landfill sites, coal mines or sewage treatment plants, {{or they may be}} by-products of industrial processes, for example in the steel or chemical industry. In recent years, these fuel gases have received increasing interest as alternative fuel sources. They are especially suited to small-scale decentralized heat and power generation. The <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of these gases range from 1 to 3 kWh/m 3 (natural gas, for comparison's sake has about 10 - 12 kWh/m 3). This is due to the large amounts of inert components such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide which can be found in these gases, the combustible species usually being methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. While the use of these gases is desirable from both economic and ecological points of view, the utilization of such fuels in technical systems poses some challenges. The composition and hen ce heating values of these gases may change quite drastically over time; also they may contain hazardous substances such as siloxanes or H 2 S, raising corrosion issues. These issues have {{to be taken into account}} when designing a burner system for such fuels. Today, low calorific gases are often utilized in combined heat and power gas engines. However, these engines are restricted to fuel gases with a minimum CH 4 content of 38 vol-% for economic reasons. Micro gas turbines (MGT), however, present an interesting alternative to utilize these gases for decentralized heat and power generation since they can handle gases with much lower CH 4 contents and varying compositions, an important consideration with low quality fuels. Also, MGTs are efficient at partial loads and can maintain low CO and NOx emissions, making them an interesting option for the utilization of low calorific fuel gases.

40|$|Burning fuels in an O 2 /H 2 O {{atmosphere}} {{is regarded as}} the next generation of oxy-fuel combustion for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). By combining oxy-fuel combustion and biomass utilization technology, CO 2 emissions could be further reduced. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the combustion characteristics of single particles from bituminous coal (BC) and pine sawdust (PS) in O 2 /N 2, O 2 /CO 2 and O 2 /H 2 O atmospheres at different O 2 mole fractions (21 %, 30 %, and 40 %). The experiments were carried out in a drop tube furnace (DTF), and a high-speed camera was used to record the combustion processes of fuel particles. The combustion temperatures were measured by a two-color method. The results reveal that the particles from BC and PS all ignite homogeneously. Replacing N 2 by CO 2 results in a longer ignition delay time and lower combustion temperatures. After substituting H 2 O for N 2, the ignition delay time is shortened, which is mainly caused by the steam gasification reaction (C + H 2 O → CO + H 2) and steam shift reaction (CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2). In addition, the combustion temperatures are first decreased at low O 2 mole fractions, and then increased at high O 2 mole fractions because the oxidation effect of H 2 O performs a more important role than its volumetric heat capacity and thermal radiation capacity. At the same condition, particles from PS ignite earlier because of their higher reactivity, but the combustion temperatures are lower than those of BC, which is owing to their <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} oxygenated neat palm biodiesel in a direct injection single cylinder diesel engine in terms of ignition, combustion and emissions characteristics. Conventional non-oxygenated diesel fuel is compared as baseline. The engine testing is performed between the operating speed of 2000 - 3000 rpm and load of up to 3 bar of brake mean effective pressure. From it, a total of 50 experiment cases are tested to form a comprehensive operational speed-load contour map for ignition and combustion; while various engine-out emissions such as NO, CO, UHCs and CO 2 are compared based on fuel type-speed combinations. The ignition and combustion evolution contour maps quantify the absolute ignition delay period and elucidate the difference between that of palm biodiesel and fossil diesel. Although diesel has shorter ignition delay period by up to 0. 6 CAD at 3000 rpm and burns more rapidly {{at the start of}} combustion, combustion of palm biodiesel accelerates during the mid-combustion phase and overtakes diesel in the cumulative heat release rates (HRR) prior to the 90 % cumulative HRR.

Biofules are considered promising unlimited potentiality and they are renewable, burn-clean, and also useful blending to gasoline. Bioethanol is grain alcohol derived from sugar cane, corn or other crop. It is widely used as vehicle fuel in some countries, particularly Brazil and, more recently, the U. S. as well. However, the idea has generated little enthusiasm it does not almost spread in Japan. Such fuels are now used only in {{a small number of}} experimental projects. The law regulating the quality of gasoline in our country limits the amount of ethanol 3 % by volume (E 3). The government’s target is 500, 000 kL per year (equivalent in oil) of in 2010. This value shows equal to or less than 1 % of total gasoline consumption. A bout tax incentive for use of alternative fuel, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry and the Environment Ministry are lobbying for a tax change in fiscal 2007 to exempt the portion of ethanol in blended fuel from the gasoline tax. In a bioethanol zone in the subtropical prefecture of Okinawa, financial support is provided to boost production of sugar cane. And, in a several areas, the establishment of manufacturing facilities for mass production of ethanol from wheat out of standard and sugar cane is planned together with facilities to mix ethanol with gasoline. In January 2006 U. S. President George W. Bush announced a plan to whittle down U. S. oil imports from the Middle East to one-quarter of the current amount by 2025 through efforts to develop technologies using ethanol as fuel.

In our tests, the characteristics of engine starting in the E 3 fueled vehicle did not show a significant difference for gasoline powered vehicles.

Moreover, due to the notable dust agglomeration, to validly measure MEC, the moisture content of test dust should not exceed 10 wt %. When the moisture content is lower than 10 wt %, the MEC smoothly increases with the rise of moisture content. With the decrease of particle size, the measured MEC becomes lower, and the MEC has an approximate linear relation with particle size. The results reported in this work provide the experimental basis and data guidance for the prevention and evaluation of dust explosion risk...|$|E
30|$|Figure  4 {{demonstrates}} {{that a very}} smaller portion on the curve in right edge consists of high yield (3.5  ml) zones and smaller lower yield (3.0  ml) zone at the lower left corner. It is found that a higher calorific value zone could be obtained using a NaCl concentrations range of 0.73 – 0.77  % and chloroform range of 196 – 198  ml. While a <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> zone resulted from a NaCl concentrations range of 0.70 – 0.71  % and chloroform range of 120 – 128  ml. This curve point out that high calorific value is more responsive to NaCl concentrations than to chloroform when temperature is kept constant.|$|E

In particular, this paper focuses the attention to the possibility of a correct combustion close to the flameless regime, even in the presence of <b>lower</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> fuels like those that can be found with high concentrations in the biomass derived ones. In addition, the authors pay attention to the nitric oxide control by means of an optimal choice of the pilot injector location...|$|E

The objective {{of this study is}} to develop country-specific net <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and carbon emission factors for petroleum energy produced in Korea. <b>Calorific</b> <b>values</b> and carbon contents of the fuels were measured using the oxygen bomb calorimeter method and the CHN elemental analysis method, respectively. Sulfur and hydrogen contents, which were used to calculate the net <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> were also measured and then net <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and carbon emission factors were determined based on the measurement results. The net <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and carbon emission factors determined for the petroleum produced in Korea 2012 and 2013 were compared to those in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Most of the values were different compared with the default values of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines although those were placed within their upper and lower limits. Time series analysis results showed inconsistent seasonal variation for the net <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and carbon emissio...|$|R
30|$|To {{calculate}} the fuel use of NGVs {{in terms of}} energy, the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the fuel is required. Different fuels have different <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> that estimate the energy they contain. Usually, energy is reflected by the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of each fuel. In this study, the <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of gasoline, diesel, CNG and LNG fuel are 31.87, 35.83, 7.12 and 21.35  MJ/L, respectively (British Petroleum (BP) 2016; Huo et al. 2012). In addition, the density of gasoline and diesel fuel is 0.74 and 0.84  kg/L (BP 2016; National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 2016).|$|R
40|$|Bomb {{calorimeter}} is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the amount of heat (<b>calorific</b> <b>value)</b> which was released on combustion (in O 2 excess) of a compound, food material, and fuel. 	Solar is a fuel came fom petroleum processed at the oil refinery and separated the results based on their boiling points so as to produce various of fuels. Usually, solar used for diesel transportation which has a large CC such as truck, tronton, bus, etc. 	The experiment using by calorimeter bomb with 500 ml solar as a sample to test the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of solar. The principle of bomb calorimeter is carried out under conditions of constant volume without flow or in other the combustion reaction carried out without the use of flame but uses oxygen as the gas burner with a constant volume or high voltage. 	The result of this test be obtained <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> from second trialincreased and different from other experiment <b>calorific</b> <b>value.</b> Because when the temperature setting on the second trial only allowed to stand a few minutes from the previous experiments that cause the lack of accurate data is obtained.
