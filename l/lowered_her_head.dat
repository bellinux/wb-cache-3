6000|$|Frances <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{upon her}} bosom, for a moment, in shame; then, {{elevating}} her fine and glowing face, she added, with enthusiasm,-- ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slowly with}} a {{backward}} gesture {{of her arm}} as if to keep me off, for I had sprung to my feet all at once as if mad.|$|E

60|$|She put {{her hand}} into his offered palm, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> dark with bronze glints, upon which her father's hand rested for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a high}} {{compliment}} {{from one}} who is himself so beautiful," [...] murmured Scraps, casting down her suspender-button eyes by <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "But, tell me, good sir, are you not a trifle lumpy?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{a prayer for}} {{explanation}} trembling on her lips. But before the calm command of his tone and glance she slowly <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and withdrew beyond the curtain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on, dear," [...] I said; [...] "tell {{me what it}} is that {{troubles}} you?" [...] This time I saw {{the tears}} drop, as she <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and hid her face from me.|$|E
60|$|She {{was quite}} collected. Changing her {{position}} casually, she threw an elbow well {{over on the}} skin bale, rested her body upon it, and arranged her parka. In this way he was completely concealed. Then, and still most casually, she reclined across him, {{so that he could}} breathe between her arm and breast, and when she <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> her ear pressed lightly against his lips.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old lady}} turned her {{flashing}} eyes on Mrs. Tolbridge, and, slightly <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she almost screamed these words: [...] "Blow {{to the top}} of the sky Mrs. Drane's influence on Miriam! That is not what I care for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{stayed in}} the prison for a month, and every day I went to see him. Then came the trial and {{he was sentenced to}} prison for life. They—they proved that he ordered his men to shoot,” she added, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as if ashamed.|$|R
6000|$|... "How the safest? What is your protection?" [...] For {{several moments}} that spun {{themselves}} out endlessly she looked me {{straight in the}} face, the stars in her eyes seeming to glow like fire; then, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she took a fold of her shroud {{and held it up}} to me.|$|R
60|$|The low whisper reached Helen's ears. She {{seemed to}} float dreamily away to some {{beautiful}} world, {{with the music}} of those words ringing in her ears. She looked at him again. Had she been dreaming? No; his dark eyes met hers with a love that {{he could no longer}} deny. An exquisite emotion, keen, strangely sweet and strong, yet terrible with sharp pain, pulsated through her being. The revelation had been too abrupt. It was so wonderfully different from what she had ever dared hope. She <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|Jones {{could not}} let well enough alone; he {{acknowledged}} this even as he swore he must have five. Emboldened by his marvelous luck, and yielding headlong to the passion within, he threw caution to the winds. A lame old cow with a red calf caught his eye; in he spurred his willing horse and slung his rope. It stung the haunch of the mother. The mad grunt she vented was no quicker than the velocity with which she plunged and reared. Jones had but time to swing his leg over the saddle when the hoofs beat down. Kentuck rolled on the plain, flinging his rider from him. The infuriated buffalo <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for the fatal charge on the horse, when the plainsman, jerking out his heavy Colts, shot her dead in her tracks.|$|E
50|$|Dove's {{interest}} in fragrance was sparked {{at an early}} age when his mother kissed him goodnight; as she <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to kiss him, he was aware that her fragrance lingered in his room long after she had gone, keeping the image of her cocktail dress and the kiss alive. This interest developed whilst Dove grew up, as a teenager he spent his money purchasing small bottles of scent and was impressed that the tiny containers could contain such an overwhelming effect.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} {{where he had}} left her, gazing after him, leaning forward with her hands still held behind her. Suddenly, as with an inspiration, she raised them both, carried them impetuously to her lips, blew him a dozen riotous kisses, and then, <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> like a colt, whisked her skirt behind her, and vanished in the cover.|$|R
50|$|Though mostly found singly or in pairs, {{larger numbers}} may {{concentrate}} at favourite flowering trees, where they act aggressively towards other sunbird species. The complex song is a loud, sustained twittering. Food includes emergent termites, spiders and nectar. In courtship a male will hop about a branch near a female, droop one wing, then the other, and finally both wings. The wings {{will then be}} fluttered and displayed. A responsive female may <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and assume a rigid posture.|$|R
5000|$|Back at {{the boxing}} ring, Starbuck and Apollo have battled {{each other to}} a stand-still. They slump {{against each other in}} the middle of the ring with their arms around each other. An awkward silence follows, and the spectators shuffle out of the hall. Anders leaves too, while Dee <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Starbuck whispers to Apollo that she has [...] "missed him". Apollo replies that he missed her, too. As the scene fades out, there is the trace of a smile upon Starbuck's face.|$|R
5000|$|Hansen Jacobsen {{created the}} {{original}} plaster model in 1892, {{shortly after he}} had settled in Paris where he lived until 1901. His newly wedded wife Gabriela served as model for the mother crouching on the ground. The literary inspiration for the work was Hans Christian Andersen's tale The Story of a Mother. When the sculpture was exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1894, the catalogue contained a slightly {{modified version of the}} last sentence of the tale: [...] "And she <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> into her lap. And Death took her child into the Unknown Lands".|$|E
500|$|Mom and Dad {{tells the}} story of Joan Blake (June Carlson), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell). After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl {{requests}} [...] "hygiene books" [...] from her mother Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married. [...] The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as the film fades into intermission.|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] was created with an unknown release date. The video begins with Durand {{walking into a}} futuristic photo booth located in an open space {{surrounded}} by lanterns, while shots of the Ivy members, who are outside of the booth, are displayed. As Durand continues singing, several individuals enter and exit the room while getting their picture taken, each leaving with a CD in their hand. Durand sings into a microphone while Chase and Schlesinger play their guitars. For the final verse, Durand <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to the microphone as the screen fades to black.|$|R

5000|$|The psychical {{researcher}} J. B. Rhine {{investigated the}} horse and {{concluded that there was}} evidence for extrasensory perception between human and horse. However, the magician Milbourne Christopher investigated {{the horse and}} noticed that the phenomenon was the result of cueing from her trainer, Fonda. He determined that Lady Wonder only answered questions correctly when her trainer was aware of the answer. According to Christopher [...] "Lady was trained to move <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back and forth above the board bearing the letters. When she was over the right lever, a slight movement of Mrs Fonda's stick cued <b>her</b> to <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and touch the proper lever." [...] Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that the Lady was [...] "a well-trained animal, not a telepathic one." ...|$|R
50|$|Canegrass dragons reach sexual {{maturity}} at around one year old. During the breeding season, the male will attract a female by repeated head bobs, which displays {{his willingness to}} mate. If the female is not ready she will run away, however if she is, she will <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> several times to show she is interested. The breeding season for the dragons is from October to April {{and in that time}} the female can lay between four and six clutches. After fertilization, the eggs will develop in approximately two to three weeks. The dragons are oviparous, and will lay between one and three eggs per clutch in a small nest in moist sandy soil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just a {{word with}} your pretty friend here." [...] He {{stretched}} out an unsteady hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or foes. <b>Lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she repeated a manoeuvre of childish days, and butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly on the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they sought was some way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their breath was coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James's door. Tuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.|$|R

50|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature by {{one year of}} age, while males take one-and-a-half-year before they mature. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year. When females gather, the males compete among {{each other for the}} right to mate, showing polygyny in males. The rutting male approaches the female in a lower bending posture, sniffing her vulva. The female may move slowly or react nervously. Even if the female flees, the male continues pursuing her steadily, without showing any sign of hurry. A receptive female will raise <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with <b>her</b> mouth wide open, following which the male will begin attempts at mounting. At the time of mounting the female <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> while the male first bends and then straightens his forelegs and rests his head and neck on her back. The two remain together for one or two days, during which time the male ensures that no other male can approach the female.|$|R
2500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Ellen von Unwerth, with {{additional}} photos by Mario Testino. The cover depicts Jackson <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> amidst a crimson backdrop, symbolizing remorse. [...] "Janet" [...] is faintly embossed in a pixelated block formation. Jackson stated, [...] "The shot we {{used on the}} cover shows me just looking down, and that's what the album was about, looking inward". MTV News regarded the artwork as iconic and an influence on various artists. Its internal artwork depicts Jackson's piercings and tattoos, also displaying her hands tied in bondage and latex attire, exhibiting fetishism. A particular photo of Jackson wearing a latex ensemble with her nipple piercing peering through an opening gained notoriety for its explicit nature. The photo also shows Jackson pricking her body with an ice pick.|$|R
60|$|Jasper {{advanced}} rapidly, but noiselessly, to the canoe, {{and with}} a gentle violence induced Mabel to place herself in such an attitude as concealed her entire body, though it would have probably exceeded his means to induce the girl so far to <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{that she could not}} keep her gaze fastened on their enemies. He then took his own post near her, with his rifle cocked and poised, in readiness to fire. Arrowhead and Chingachgook crawled to the cover, and lay in wait like snakes, with their arms prepared for service, while the wife of the former bowed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> between <b>her</b> knees, covered it with her calico robe, and remained passive and immovable. Cap loosened both his pistols in their belt, but seemed quite at a loss what course to pursue. The Pathfinder did not stir. He had originally got a position where he might aim with deadly effect through the leaves, and where he could watch the movements of his enemies; and he was far too steady to be disconcerted at a moment so critical.|$|R
50|$|The three musketeers {{retrieve}} the treaty and {{learn that the}} Cardinal is planning something on King Louis' birthday, though it does not specify what in the treaty. Athos attempts to learn what it is by visiting Sabine in her cell. She asks if he can stop her execution tomorrow. Athos cannot and Sabine does not reveal what the Cardinal's plan is. During the execution, just as Sabine is <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for the executioner, Athos stops him and begs forgiveness from Sabine for his betrayal. She accepts and whispers to Athos Richelieu's plans to assassinate King Louis before jumping off a cliff to her death. After learning of the Cardinal's plan, the three musketeers set out to re-band {{the rest of the}} musketeers, in secret, for the king's birthday celebration. Richelieu and Rochefort hire a sharpshooter to assassinate the king. During the assembly, D'Artagnan is able to stop the sniper from killing the king, but the shot narrowly misses its target and the Cardinal blames the musketeers in the crowd for the attempted assassination.|$|R
500|$|Condors {{begin to}} look for a mate when they reach sexual {{maturity}} at the age of six. To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April. The egg weighs about [...] and measures from [...] in length and about [...] in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents [...] "double clutch", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.|$|R
40|$|Oral sex {{is widely}} used in human foreplay, but rarely {{documented}} in other animals. Fellatio has been recorded in bonobos Pan paniscus, but even then functions largely as play behaviour among juvenile males. The short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx exhibits resource defence polygyny and one sexually active male often roosts with groups of females in tents made from leaves. Female bats often lick their mate’s penis during dorsoventral copulation. The female <b>lowers</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to lick the shaft or {{the base of the}} male’s penis but does not lick the glans penis which has already penetrated the vagina. Males never withdrew their penis when it was licked by the mating partner. A positive relationship exists between the length of time that the female licked the male’s penis during copulation and the duration of copulation. Furthermore, mating pairs spent significantly more time in copulation if the female licked her mate’s penis than if fellatio was absent. Males also show postcopulatory genital grooming after intromission. At present, we do not know why genital licking occurs, and we present four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that may explain the function of fellatio in C. sphinx...|$|R

50|$|Kyriaki was {{tortured}} {{again by}} Apollonius, the successor of Hilarion. She {{was thrown into}} a fire, but the flames were extinguished, and then to wild beasts, but they became tame and gentle. Apollonius then sentenced her to death by the sword. As she was given a few time to pray, she asked God to receive her soul and to remember those who honored her martyrdom. Upon completing her prayer, she rendered her soul to God before the sword was <b>lowered</b> on <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Pious Christians took her relics and buried them. At {{the time of her}} death, she was 21 years old.|$|R
6000|$|When {{within a}} quarter of a mile of the breakers, the man with the lead proclaimed a depth of ten fathoms. This was better than they had expected. The jib was <b>lowered,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> brought dead to wind. The captain shouted [...] "cut," [...] and, in an instant, the {{stoppers}} were severed, and two heavy anchors dropt into the sea. One had a heavy chain cable, the other hemp; and these were allowed to run out to the bits. The vessel brought up with less shock than could be expected. A wave or two passed under her, and still her cable held.|$|R
500|$|Breeding {{behavior}} commences with a courtship chase {{with the}} female running in a crouch, pursued by the male, who adopts a more upright stance and has his neck outstretched. The female may stop and <b>lower</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and tail to allow copulation; this takes just a few seconds, but may be repeated several times in an hour. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves, sometimes with a loose canopy, built in a depression and hidden under a grass tussock or small bush; it may be on dry ground or slightly raised above standing water, or occasionally floating. The nest is about [...] across with the internal cup [...] deep, and [...] wide. The clutch size is from 3 to 11 pink-coloured eggs; the first is often laid when the nest {{is little more than}} a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day. Both sexes incubate, and the eggs start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to five weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether a second brood is raised.|$|R
