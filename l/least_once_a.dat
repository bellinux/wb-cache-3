He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, he liked to boast about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini would become an important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss.

5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day.

5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven courts were located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven courts were part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From {{time to time}} the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, {{it is worth noting}} that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E
