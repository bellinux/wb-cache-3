30|$|In Sweden, {{the cost}} of {{antibiotics}} – like most other prescription medicines – is partly reimbursed. If the total cost for medicines during one year has surpassed a ceiling of SEK 1800 (around € 200), the cost is <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{antibiotics}} in Belgian hospitals are nearly <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> {{by the health}} insurance. Such a situation is not conductive to rational drug use. A new reimbursement system for perioperatively-administered antibiotics in Belgian hospitals was implemented in May 1997 by Royal Decree. A reimbursement code for antibiotic use {{was linked to the}} reimbursement of surgical interventions. This code represents a reimbursement which covers 75 % of the cost of perioperative prophylaxis based on optimal indication, dose, and duration as recommended by international and Belgian consensus guidelines. The actual antibiotic prescribed during the 72 -hour perioperative period (the day before, during and after surgery) is reimbursed at only 25 % of its full cost. Thus, if the perioperative prophylactic antibiotic regimen complies with the evidence-based guidelines, the costs of antibiotic prescribing will be <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> by the health insurance (75 % of the standard + 25 % of the actual costs). The new reimbursement system does not apply to antibiotics which are prescribed for treatment of intercurrent infections; these antibiotics continue to be <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed.</b> Annual expenditures for antibiotics, for both antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis, nationwide and per hospital, have shown marked improvements in perioperative antibiotic use after the decree was implemented. Surgeons' adherence to the evidence-based standard of prophylactic antibiotic use has improved over time. In conclusion, rapid implementation of the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis policy was achieved through changes in the reimbursement of antibiotics for surgery patients. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the impact of out-of-pocket costs on Dutch general practitioners' prescribing. A {{qualitative}} study using focus groups was conducted. An open-ended topic guide was used to elucidate the influence of out-of-pocket costs on decision making for the treatment of dyspepsia, hay fever, hormone replacement therapy, and hypertension. A total of 21 Dutch GPs from University Departments of General Practice participated in four separate focus groups. These discussions were held between November 1998 and March 1999. Each discussion was tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. From this transcription, key factors and issues were identified. GPs reported that they do not generally take out-of-pocket costs into account. <b>Fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> drugs were usually prescribed and GPs felt that most patients were highly motivated and thus willing to pay for their medication. The patient charges were seen to be low and not likely to affect patients' willingness to pay. GPs felt that patients need not have to pay for their medication. They adjusted their drug choice in order to avoid co-payment and were willing to agree to a patient's demand for a reimbursed prescription. GPs describe their prescribing as not influenced by out-of-pocket costs. GPs seem inclined to avoid co-payment for patients when patients have financial difficulties and the disease is perceived as severe. They chose <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> drugs.

30|$|In Section “The bank trusts {{the small}} {{business}} and {{the small business}} reciprocates”, we described a case where a bank chooses to endow trust in a small business and the small business repays the <b>loan</b> <b>fully</b> on time to reciprocate trust from bank.

Specifically, we consider a case where a bank chooses to trust a small business from the first round by granting loans based on its trust antecedents and subjective trust. However, the small business is driven by a high level of self-interest motivation and it decides to default from the very beginning without repaying the <b>loan</b> <b>fully</b> on time.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spent more than $ 15 million to move air traffic controllers and their managers to new permanent duty locations. FAA classifies the funds that it spends for these moves as permanent change of station (PCS) benefits. In 1998, {{as part of a}} broader effort to reform its personnel policies, FAA changed its policies on PCS benefits. Instead of <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursing</b> the costs of all PCS moves and prohibiting unfunded PCS moves, as it once did, FAA now determines the amount of PCS benefits to be offered on a position-by-position basis and allows employees and managers to move at their own expense. Under its new polices, FAA can <b>fully</b> <b>reimburse</b> the costs of a move if it determines that he move is in the interest of the government, or it can offer partial fixed relocation benefits if it determines that the agency will derive some benefit from the move. FAA's policies on eligibility for PCS benefits are the same for air traffic controllers and their managers, but the amounts of the benefits vary. According to these policies, eligibility depends on a determining official's decision about how critical a position is and/or whether FAA will benefit from the move. Air traffic controllers have been less likely than air traffic managers to be offered PCS benefits when they move between facilities. Between fiscal year 1999 and 2001, Air Traffic Services funded 16 percent of moves involving a promotion and 6 percent of lateral moves between field facilities for controllers, compared with 38 percent of promotional moves and 34 percent of lateral moves for managers. According to FAA officials, PCS costs have decreased and FAA's ability to quickly fill vacant controller positions has improved since the new PCS policies took effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Despite the {{efficacy}} of innovative treatments for metastatic melanoma, their high costs has led to disparities in cancer care among different European countries. We analysed the availability of these innovative therapies in Europe and estimated {{the number of patients}} without access to first-line recommended treatment per current guidelines of professional entities such as the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), and European Dermatology Forum (EDF). Materials and methods Web-based online survey was conducted in 30 European countries with questions about the treatment schedules from 1 st May 2015 to 1 st May 2016 : number of metastatic melanoma patients, registration and reimbursement of innovative medicines (updated data, as of 1 st October 2016), percentage of patients treated and availability of clinical studies and compassionate-use programmes. Results The recommended BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) + MEK inhibitor (MEKi) combination was both registered and <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> in 9 / 30 (30 %) countries, and in 13 / 30 (43 %) (all from Eastern Europe) not reimbursed. First-line immunotherapy with anti-PD 1 antibodies was registered and <b>fully</b> <b>reimbursed</b> in 14 / 30 (47 %) countries, while in 13 / 30 (43 %) (all from Eastern Europe) not reimbursed. It was estimated that in Europe 19, 600 patients with metastatic melanoma are treated, and 5238 (27 %) {{do not have access to}} recommended first-line therapy. Significant correlation was found between human development index (HDI, UNDP report 2015), (r = 0. 662; p < 0. 001), health expenditure per capita (r = 0. 695; p < 0. 001) and the Mackenbach score of health policy performance (r = 0. 765; p < 0. 001) with the percentage of patients treated with innovative medicines and a number of reimbursed medicines. Conclusions Great discrepancy exists in metastatic melanoma treatment across Europe. It is crucial to increase the awareness of national and European policymakers, oncological societies, melanoma patients' associations and pharma industry...|$|R
