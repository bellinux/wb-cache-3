40|$|This paper employs {{multiple}} regression analysis {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of yieldraising techniques available to medieval farm managers (reeves) using a panel dataset of 49 manors held by the Bishop of Winchester from 1349 - 70. There are three main interesting findings. First, annual weather variation, modelled with climate reconstructions, was highly significant in explaining annual yield variation in wheat, barley, and oat yields, though the weather influenced each grain differently. Second, there is evidence that planting <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> and livestock stocking rates had small or even negative effects on grain yields. Finally, there is indirect evidence that reeves responded to economic incentives in allocating labour inputs such as manuring, weeding, harvesting, and gleaning among their crops, giving them a small ability to adjust their output based on economic incentives. These findings complicate our understanding of the agricultural revolution. The ineffectiveness of short-run yield-raising strategies employed in open field agriculture would support Overton’s traditional argument of the importance of enclosure for the gains in agricultura...|$|E
40|$|<b>Leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> such as lucerne contain {{oestrogenic}} {{substances and}} their precursors that {{may interfere with}} reproduction in sheep. There is no definite information about the actual levels of oestrogenicity of New Zealand lucerne crops and {{the magnitude of the}} effect that they have on the reproduction of sheep. There is no information about when a crop may be unsafe for ewes to graze just prior to mating and a simple measurement of sheep is needed to provide an alert so sheep farmers can move sheep off a crop or leave them on knowing {{that there will be no}} deleterious effects on subsequent lambing performance. The sheep farm study was an incidental finding from a farmer who noticed udder development in pre-pubertal (25 - 28 weeks of age) lambs (n = 22) grazing lucerne (oestrogenicity ranging from 98. 6 – 149. 6 µg oestradiol equivalent/kg DM) compared with lambs grazing grass (n = 36) that showed no udder development. Differences in teat length, teat width, mammary development and vulva colour were measured on two occasions – straight after grazing oestrogenic lucerne (12 March) and 35 days later (16 April), 4 weeks after the removal from the lucerne crop. The experimental study was designed to provide a reference calibration with known dosage of an oestrogen. For this 12 Coopworth ewes (42 - 44 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (n = 4, per treatment) : 0, 0, 1, 1. 0 mg β-oestradiol every 3 days for 40 days. Measurements of teat length, teat width and mammary development was measured every 6 days and, on day 41, the ewes were killed and vulva colour, mammary weight, ovary weight and uterus weight were measured and the number of follicles and corpora lutea were counted. In both studies photographs of the mammary region were taken to provide an alternative measurement technique to use of calipers. Results of the sheep farm study showed lambs grazing oestrogenic lucerne were heavier, had longer teat lengths (2. 1 mm difference), with larger teat widths (4. 63 mm difference) than sheep grazing grass and mammary development (in 14 out of 25 lambs grazing lucerne) had occurred. There was no change in vulva colour. After removal from lucerne there was a slight reduction in the oestrogen-related changes and the grass-fed lambs had experienced some mammary/teat development in the intervening period. In the experimental trial, there were dose-related effects on the live weight, teat length, mammary development, uterus weight, ovary weight and mammary weight. There were no changes in teat width, vulva redness or colour saturation, numbers of ovarian follicles and there were no corpora lutea present. Measurements taken from photographs provided reliable information about mammary/teat dimensions. Although the pre-pubertal lambs grazing lucerne were receiving less oestradiol equivalent daily than the older ewes supplied with known amounts of oestradiol (181. 2 – 274. 9 µg oestradiol equivalent versus 333. 3 µg oestradiol per day, respectively), they showed a greater sensitivity to this hormonal stimulus than was exhibited by the pubertal ewes...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} supplementation in female calves with flour of Gliricidia sepium leaves (GS) on partial and final body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) a study was under-taken in the “San Pedro Farm ” located in Zulia State, in a tropi-cal sub-humid forest environment of Venezuela. The data were analyzed by the least-square analysis of variance-covariance of The Statistical Analysis System, testing effects of treatment on 7 weaned Holstein crossbred female calves, 5 months old at initiation, and supplemented with a growing ration (2 % of body weight) : (a) supplementation with 100 % of feed concen-trate (TA) and (b) a mixture of 60 % corn meal + 40 % of dehy-drated GS flour + 50 g. /animal/day of complete mineral mixture (TR). The female calves supplemented with TA reached a higher BW (106. 65 ± 2. 51 kg.) and ADG (334. 61 ± 42 g/d) than the female calves fed with TR (BW= 96. 06 ± 2. 51 kg, ADG= 157 ± 42 g/d). The apparent cause for these results was the cutting age (5 months old) of the plant {{used to make the}} ration and the lower feed intake in TR. It is important to cut the GS plant green and very young (between 6 and 12 weeks old) because it has the best rate of digestibility at this stage. It is suggested prepare a ration with a minor proportion (30 %) of GS flour, adding edible molasses to improve the palatability.

40|$|This study {{arose from}} {{the need to develop}} {{strategies}} that optimize the use of available feed resources from natural range fallow and crop residues in combination with the fodder bank innovation. The paper discusses the interactive effects of feeding both forage legume and urea molasses supplements. Since rumen flora can use non protein nitrogen (NPN) to satisfy its nitrogen (N) requirement. It was hypothesized that feeding urea molasses would raise the efficiency of utilization of natural pasture and would have a positive interactive effect with forage legume supplementation. Five treatment groups were therefore formed so that animals were either solely grazed on natural range or 2) supplemented by having access to conserved natural pasture, or 3) molasses urea blocks or 4) <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> banks and molasses urea blocks or 5) <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> banks...|$|R
