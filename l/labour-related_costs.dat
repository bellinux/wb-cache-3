40|$|Under present-day {{conditions}} of providing permanent socio-economic {{development of the}} country and aspiration of domestic enterprises to meet the case of world environment in relation to an effective business, the effective management of personnel is emphasized, that is why the important task for the enterprise management becomes the awareness of leading role of personnel and the formation of the newest vision of problem of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> determination. The analysis of statistical information of state statistics committee of Ukraine confirms a small specific gravity of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> (unlike the European countries) which makes approximately 10 % of transaction costs. For this reason the understanding of all the components of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> is becoming urgent, that will favour the reasonable dividing of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> for the purpose of optimization on the part of enterprise management. Authors consider the essence of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs.</b> They analyze subsystems of personnel management with the purpose of exposure of classification signs of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs.</b> There has been proposed the definition of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> category on the basis of grouping of subsystems from the position of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> and analysis of various approaches. There has been developed the classification of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> according to such subsystems of personnel management: a subsystem of payment of labour and social measures, a subsystem of personnel planning and marketing, a subsystem of personnel selection and hire, a subsystem of personnel estimation and accounting, a subsystem of personnel development, a subsystem of personnel stimulation, a subsystem of social development and a subsystem of working conditions organization. Thus, the scientific grounds of definition of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> and reasonable division of costs in the context of analyzed subsystems will allow the management not only to define the hidden reserves of enterprise in relation to <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> but also to manage costs with the purpose of their optimization...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{investigate}} changes in corporate disclosures of <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> in financial statements arising from {{a change in}} the accounting regime from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAPs) to international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - An archival empirical approach is taken. Data are sampled for 160 listed companies in Australia over seven years covering Australian GAAPs (2003 - 2005) and Australian IFRSs (2006 - 2009) periods. To measure disclosures, a classification and count is made of line items for <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> found on the face of and in the notes to financial statements. These disclosures are analysed against firm-specific characteristics and industry categories. Findings - Results reveal companies disclosing &# 039;total labour costs&# 039; rose from about 60 - 85 per cent, and the discretionary disaggregation of &# 039;total labour costs&# 039; became more prevalent. Companies providing disaggregated information in the post-IFRSs period are characterized by lower total assets, lower sales and lower labour costs. Their return on equity and labour intensity are not found to be differentiating characteristics. Reasons for these phenomena are addressed. Originality/value - Previous studies have not analysed the effect of IFRSs adoption on disclosures of labour-related information. This study provides new evidence about the types of firms that have responded to IFRSs with new or enhanced labour-related financial disclosures. It points to new opportunities for research and financial analysis from the enhanced availability of corporate-level labour cost data...|$|E
40|$|Although AIDS {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} "big-city" disease, it is also {{becoming}} a serious health care issue for doctors and other health care workers in "small-city" Canada. Kingston, Ont., is one of those small cities, and of the facilities trying {{to come to grips with}} a disease about which much remains to be learned. In this article, Drs. Peter Ford and David Robertson outline their hospital's estimate of the cost, in manpower and money, of dealing with the AIDS crisis. The final estimate: roughly $ 700, 000. Although most of the cost will involve one-time capital spending, they point out that there will likely be ongoing <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> because of the special programs and increased manpower needed to deal with AIDS patients. Clearly, AIDS is no longer a big-city disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the cost of}} resources required to deliver a program to assess international medical graduates (IMGs) in Newcastle, Australia, known as the Workplace Based Assessment (WBA) Program. Design and setting: A costing study to identify and evaluate the resources required and the overheads of delivering the program for a cohort of 15 IMGs, based on costs in 2012. Main outcome measures: <b>Labour-related</b> <b>costs.</b> Results: The total cost in 2012 for delivering the program to a typical cohort of 15 candidates was $ 243 384. This equated {{to an average of}} $ 16226 per IMG. After allowing for the fees paid by IMGs, the WBA Program had a deficit of $ 153384, or $ 10226 per candidate, which represents the contribution made by the health system. Conclusion: The cost per candidate to the health system of this intensive WBA program for IMGs is small...|$|E
40|$|In early 1980 s, China {{started its}} {{economic}} reform after thirty years isolation from world economy. Along its opening to outside world to encourage {{international trade and}} attract inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) to China, its own enterprises, both state-owned and private-owned also started to embrace the international market by marketing their product globally and expanding its business operations to new territories through outward FDI, mainly in forms of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and joint-venture with foreign partners. In this paper, we discuss the main financial risks that Chinese enterprises encountered in their cross-border M&A deals and the causes of such risks in context of internationalization of companies from emerging economy (EE). Through literature reviews, secondary data analysis and case studies, we have identified the major financial risks in M&A as valuation/pricing risk, financing risk and risk from payment structure. These risks have their unique/specific reflection when faced by Chinese enterprises in their cross-border M&As. The research shows that for Chinese companies‟ cross-border M&As, the valuation risk was mainly caused by information asymmetry, especially lack of labour law and industrial relation knowledge of host countries, which led to underestimated <b>labour-related</b> <b>costs</b> in post acquisition business integration. The pricing risk {{is a result of}} valuation risk and competition for deals. Interestingly, though many M&A practitioner‟s manuals indicated the primary financial risk in M&A is the risk arsing from leverage financing for acquisition, in reality, leverage financing risk itself is insignificant in Chinese companies‟ cross-border M&A deals. However, currency choice of leverage financing is a factor that acquiring company cannot ignore in its assessment on overall financial risks of an M&A deal. In the context of internationalisation of EE MNCs, these identified financial risks were rooted in the special CSAs based growing model of Chinese MNCs. In recent years, the major force of Chinese companies overseas M&A deals are large state-owned enterprises targeting on tangible assets especially natural resources. This trend, on one side, is the reflection of China‟s national energy security strategy in business arena, on another side; it is also the result of several high-profile unsuccessful M&A deals conducted by Chinese companies in IT, manufacturing sectors in the early Years of first decade of 21 st century...|$|E
