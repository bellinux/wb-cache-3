5000|$|It is {{commonly}} known as the <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> or northern bluefin tuna. The usage of the latter name, mainly in Australia to distinguish it from the southern bluefin tuna, leads to easy confusion with Thunnus thynnus of the Atlantic and Thunnus orientalis of the North Pacific. Compared to these [...] "true" [...] bluefins, Thunnus tonggol is more slender and has shorter pectoral fins.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Australia, land based game fishing can be divided into two fairly {{distinct}} geographic regions. On the north coast of New South Wales, from approximately Sydney north, light tackle is generally used, with smaller target species such as <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna,</b> Spanish mackerel and cobia. Particularly noted are the rock platforms of Jervis Bay, where black marlin of up to 200 lb have been caught using bait floated out on balloons. South of Sydney, heavier tackle is used as the target species are generally much larger, with the main targets being black marlin, yellowfin tuna, kingfish and sharks.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{most closely}} related to the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and the {{southern}} bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), and more distantly to the other large tunas of the genus Thunnus - the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). For many years, the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna species were considered to be the same, or subspecies, and referred to as the [...] "northern bluefin tuna". This name occasionally gives rise to some confusion, as the <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus tonggol) can in Australia sometimes be known under the name [...] "northern bluefin tuna".

50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E
30|$|Abdussamad et al. (2012) have {{reported}} that <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> along the Indian Coast is supported by fishery having a length range of 23 – 111  cm and a mean length of 60.5  cm in gillnets fishery. Khorshidian and Carrara (1993) indicated the differences in size composition of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> between the Iranian and Omani fisheries on {{the northern and southern}} shores of the Oman Sea. Size-related migration or differences in the mesh size of the gill nets used were possibly contributed to this difference. No differences in the monthly length frequency of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> were observed. Moreover, the average length was lower than that at first sexual maturity, indicating overfishing or the use of small mesh size nets.|$|E
30|$|The growth {{parameters}} of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> estimated by ELEFANI were as: L ∞ =  111.23  cm fork length, t 0  = − 0.38  year, ϕ′ =  3.6. The k value was 0.3  year− 1. Studies in different regions {{have indicated that}} the L ∞ of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> was differed from 55  cm in waters of Japan (Itoh et al. 1999) to 135.4  cm in Australia (Griffiths et al. 2010) and the range for k was 0.228 in Oman (Prabhakar and Dudley 1989) to 1.7 in waters of Japan (Itoh et al. 1999). The L ∞ estimated in our study for the <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> was higher than the estimates given by some previous studies (Supongpan and Saikliang 1987; Yesaki 1989; Itoh et al. 1999) but lower than that by Griffiths et al.

30|$|The {{exploitation}} rate for population of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (E =  0.63) {{in the present}} study was high. Gulland (1985) stated that in an optimally exploited stock, fishing mortality should be equal to natural mortality, resulting in an {{exploitation rate}} of 0.5. Patterson (1992) declared that the fishing rate satisfying optimal E level of 0.5 tended to reduce pelagic fish stock abundance and, hence, the former author suggested that E should be maintained at 0.4 for optimal exploitation of those stocks. The present estimate of E suggests that the population of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> in the waters of northern Persian Gulf and Oman Sea is being heavily exploited and overfished at a higher level than the optimum and a better management policy is necessary in this area. The decision making on fisheries management of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> cannot use only biological information; thus, the socioeconomic condition of small-scale fishermen in waters of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea should be considered to achieve sustainable management of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> resources. Finally, results of this study are particularly helpful for drift gillnet fisheries management in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman.|$|E
30|$|In our study, the length–weight {{relationship}} {{was estimated to}} be W =  0.00003  × FL 2.82 (R 2  =  0.84). To verify if b was significantly different from the isometric value (b =  3), the Student’s t test (H 0 : b =  3) was utilized. Results showed no difference between obtained b value (2.82) and 3 and isometric growth model was determined for <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> in study area (P >  0.05). Biswass (1993) and Froese (2006) presented the acceptable range of b value between 2.5 and 3.5 that is in agreement with our estimation. Length–weight relationship for <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> was estimated as W =  0.0148  × L 3.0 in waters of India (Abdussamad et al. 2012), indicating a perfect isometric pattern in growth that is in agreement with the results of our study. Griffiths et al. (2010) estimated the length–weight relationship of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> as W =  0.00005  × L 2.82 in tropical and temperate waters of the central Indo-Pacific that is completely in agreement with our findings.|$|E
30|$|The total {{mortality}} for <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> was 1.15  year− 1.

The fork length (FL) of all specimens ranged from 27 to 107  cm, and total weight (TW) was between 200 and 12, 000  g. Among the length frequencies examined, specimens with fork length in the range of 62 – 65  cm were the dominant group. The equation of length–weight relationship was estimated as TW =  0.00003  × FL 2.82 (R 2  =  0.84) and isometric growth model was determined for <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> in study area. The parameters of Von Bertalanffy growth function were obtained as: L ∞ =  111.23  cm, k =  0.3  year− 1 and t 0  = − 0.38  years and ϕ′ =  3.6. The annual instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) was estimated to be 1.15, 0.43 and 0.72  year− 1, respectively.

40|$|Age {{and growth}} of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus tonggol) were {{assessed}} by examination of annual growth increments in sectioned sagittal otoliths from 461 fish (238 – 1250 mm fork length, LF) sampled from tropical and temperate waters in the central Indo-Pacific between February 2003 and April 2005. Edge and microincrement analyses (presumed daily increments) suggest that <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> deposit a single annual growth increment mainly between August and October. Age was, therefore, estimated for all fish by counting assumed annual growth increments. Ages ranged from 154 d to 18. 7 years, with most fish being 3 – 9 years. Five growth models were fitted to length-at-age data, all of which indicated that the species is relatively slow-growing and long-lived. Recaptures of two tagged fish at liberty for 6. 2 and 10. 5 years support this notion. A bias-corrected form of Akaike's Information Criterion determined that the Schnute–Richards model provided the best fit to length-at-age data, with model parameter estimates (sexes combined) of L{infty} = 135. 4 cm LF, K = 22. 3 year– 1, t 0 = 0. 120 years, {delta} = 150. 0, v = 0. 019, and {gamma} = 2. 7 x 10 – 8.

30|$|Tuna fishes, Scombridae family, {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important marine resources for industrial fishing activities in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Kamrani et al. 2010). The Scombridae is a family of 15 genera and about 50 species of epipelagic marine fishes (Block and Stevens 2001). The main tuna species caught in the Iranian waters of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea are: <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus tonggol Bleeker, 1851), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares Bonnaterre, 1788), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis Linnaeus, 1758), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis Cantor, 1849), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard Lacepede, 1800), Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson Lacepede, 1800) and Indo-Pacific king mackerel (Scomberomorus guttatus Bloch & Schneider, 1801). Tuna fishes constitute around 50 % of total landings of the Hormozgan province and total annual commercial landings of tuna fishes in Iranian waters of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were around 175, 000 tonnes. <b>Longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> represented 46 % of total catch (Iran Fishery Organization 2013).|$|E
30|$|<b>Longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> is an epipelagic species inhabiting {{tropical}} to temperate {{regions of}} the Indo-Pacific, found almost exclusively in the neritic waters close to the shore, avoiding estuaries, turbid wasters and open Ocean.

No correlation was observed between histamine and TVB-N values except at 25 oC and assessment of TVB-N was not sufficient for estimating the degree of histamine-related health hazard. Poor correlation was found between sensory score and pooled TVB-N value compared to histamine, and the correlation was closer at 8 and 25 oC than at the lower temperatures...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{at the behest}} of the Papua New Guinea Government in 1973 and extended to 1978. It aimed at elucidating the various aspects of the life history of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus tonggol with a consideration of the factors influencing distribution, relative abundance and exploitation. During this period, 414 tagged fish were released with an overall recapture rate of 8. 6 % being recorded. Age at first maturity was established at approximately 60 cm for both sexes with a spring-summer spawning being postulated on the basis of gonadal development as evidenced by increasing gonadal indices. No significant departure from the 1 : 1 sex ratio was observed. [...] Von Bertalanffy growth eguations were derived from the reading of increments on sagittal otoliths and modal progression analysis, and yielded respectively:- Lt = 131. 8 [1 -e⁻·³⁹⁵ ⁽t⁻·⁰³⁵⁾] and Lt = 122. 91 [1 -e⁻·⁴¹ ⁽t⁻·⁰³²⁾] Both curves were consistent with growth indications from tag recoveries. The predictive length-weight relationship was determined to be ln(Wt) = - 9. 67 + 2. 656 ln(L. C. F.) and no significant differences existed between the sexes. [...] Longtail were shown to be opportunistic feeders: fish constituted the major portion of the diet and increased in accord with longtail size. It is postulated that longtail undergo longshore migrations due to thermal requirements and that these allowed for a hypothetical spawning site around the Aru Island region - an acknowledged nutrient rich area during spring. Both morphometric and biochemical analyses failed to establish the existence of an eastern and western Australian <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> population although there is strong evidence to suggest that sub-specific differences occur between Malaysian and Australian-P. N. G. stocks. [...] The exploitation of longtail at three levels; artisanal, amateur and commercial are reported. Concern is expressed as to the lack of data collection and collation of the Taiwanese gillnet fleet operating in the Australian Fishing Zone and about the exploitation of pre-adult <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna.</b> Accordingly, recommendations are made to alleviate the statistical problems and that consideration be given to a detailed study of the fishing parameters which affect the population dynamics of <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna.</b> The latter recommendation in particular should examine the impact that the foreign operated fishery has had on the stocks in Oceania.

30|$|Knowledge {{of growth}} and {{mortality}} parameters is essential for understanding the population dynamics of different species. Several approaches were often {{used to determine the}} age and growth of the aquatic species, such as length–frequency analyses, tagging and recapture experiments and observations of the mark on the hard parts (scales, otoliths, spines and vertebrates) (Stequert et al. 1996). Particular morphometric measurements, such as length–weight relationship (LWR), are useful in fishery management and stock assessment models (Barría et al. 2014), and has been widely used in the environmental monitoring programs such as calculation of fish weight at a certain length and the conversion of an equation of growth in weight and vice versa, as well as the calculation of a condition index to allow for morphological comparisons of populations among different regions (Yoon et al. 2013; Oliveira et al. 2014). The general biology and population dynamics of the several tuna species have been researched in Iranian waters of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Kaymaram et al. 2010; Taghavi Motlagh et al. 2010; Hosseini and Ehsani 2014).

Methods: Samples of four popular brands of canned fish in the Iranian market (yellowfin tuna, common Kilka, Kawakawa and <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna)</b> were analyzed for levels of Cu, Ni, Fe and Cr after wet digestion with acids using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: The mean concentrations for the metals in the different brands were: For Cu: 0. 91, 0. 73, 1. 18 and 0. 84 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively. For Ni: 0. 37, 0. 19, 0. 14 and 0. 18 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively; For Fe: 45. 9, 34. 0, 77. 53 and 61. 3 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively.

40|$|Mercury, cadmium, {{and lead}} {{concentrations}} were determined in various fishery products (fishes, cephalopod molluscs, and crustaceans) imported into Italy from many European and non-European coastal countries. Considerable {{differences were found}} in the concentrations of these metals among the products tested. The highest mean Hg concentration was found in fishes (0. 21 μg g - 1 wet weight), whereas cephalopods had the highest mean Cd concentration (0. 35 mg g 21 wet weight). Swordfish (0. 80 μg g - 1 wet weight), <b>longtail</b> <b>tuna</b> (0. 53 μg g - 1 wet weight), and thornback ray (0. 52 μg g - 1 wet weight) had the highest concentrations of Hg, whereas maximum Cd concentrations were found in samples of common cuttlefish (0. 85 μg g - 1 wet weight) and common octopus (0. 64 μg g - 1 wet weight). The majority of the samples analyzed were in compliance with European Union legislation, except for a few cases. The calculated mean weekly intakes of Hg, Cd, and Pb through consumption of the fishery products tested were all below the legislated respective provisional tolerable weekly intakes. In general, the samples analyzed were considered safe to eat with regard to the metal concentrations found and the allowable intakes based on legislation. Nevertheless, the consumption of some species may be of significant importance for consumer health. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection...|$|E
30|$|More {{stratified}} conditions, {{along with}} acidification {{of the upper}} 300  m layer (Fig.  7), shoaling of the oxycline (Fig.  8) and declining oxygen concentrations will directly contribute to increasing fish kill incidents (Fig.  13) and habitat compression for pelagic fishes over Omani shelf. This habitat compression is likely {{the cause of the}} reduced variability in sardine landings (Fig.  11). Oxygen concentrations below 3.5  ml L− 1 are stressful for many larger tropical pelagic fish (Prince and Goodyear 2006; Stramma et al. 2012). Oxygen and a shoaling oxycline both result in pelagic populations compressed in the upper layer. This increases they susceptibility to trawling and traditional fishing practices. Consequently, artisanal landings of pelagic species in Oman are tightly linked to hydrophysical processes and their changes over the last 50  years. Landings for 13 major groups of large pelagic species (Yellowfin tuna, <b>Longtail</b> <b>tuna,</b> Kawakawa, Stripped bonito, Frigate tuna, Other tuna, Skipjack, Kingfish, Queenfish, Baracuda, Cobia, Sailfish, and Large jacks) displayed positive trends through the past 20  years (Fishery Statistics Book 2012). However, rising landings (markedly driven by increased number of boats) might end soon. A shoaling oxycline (Fig.  8) could reach an ecological threshold of oxygen depletion in the upper 50  m layer, pushing hypoxic waters further onto the Omani shelf in the coming decades. Further shoaling could cause a gradual decline or even a collapse of large pelagic fisheries as many species will move offshore. This is a critical issue as the artisanal fishery, accounting for 96  % of Omani landings, represents the cornerstone of the national industry, directly employing around 40, 000 fishermen (Fishery Statistics Book 2012; Piontkovski et al. 2014).|$|E
