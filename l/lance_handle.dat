6000|$|The {{ride that}} {{followed}} {{was really quite}} exhilarating. The camels, notwithstanding their long journey, seemed to have caught some of the enthusiasm of the war-horse {{as described in the}} Book of Job; indeed I had no idea that they could travel at such a rate. On we swung down the slope, keeping excellent order, the forest of tall spears shining and the little lancer-like pennons fluttering on the breeze in a very gallant way. In silence we went save for the thudding of the hoofs of the camels and an occasional squeal of anger as some rider drove his <b>lance</b> <b>handle</b> into their ribs. Not until we actually joined battle did a single man open his lips. Then, it is true, there went up one simultaneous and mighty roar of: ...|$|E

60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} shout close at hand, and two other Eskimos ran {{out from behind the}} ice-hummocks and joined their comrade. They were armed with long <b>lances,</b> the <b>handles</b> of which were made of bone, and the points of {{beautiful}} white ivory tipped with steel. It was afterwards discovered that these natives obtained small pieces of iron and steel from the Eskimos further south, who were in the habit of trading at the settlements on the coast of Greenland.|$|R
50|$|With Julie {{dead and}} Michael and Debbie gone, Philip relies on help from Helen {{to bring up}} Hannah. Philip begins a {{relationship}} with Jen Handley, which Hannah is ecstatic about. However, the relationship later ends. Shortly after Helen suffers a stroke and is hospitalised, Philip meets Ruth Wilkinson, the mother of Hannah's ex-boyfriend, Lance (Andrew Bibby) and they clash over Helen's care. Philip and Ruth kiss on Christmas Day 1996, which is witnessed by <b>Lance</b> who <b>handles</b> it badly. Eventually, all their respective children accept the couple. Philip and Ruth's relationship goes through several tests including Helen's death in 1997, Philip's proposal seconds before Ruth's other son, Ben Atkins (Brett Cousins) is injured in a racing car accident and Ruth's breast cancer scare. The couple marry, but Hannah {{finds it hard to}} adjust and she goes to stay in Paris for six months.|$|R
50|$|Lorie {{would have}} {{canceled}} her Rome trip if Brock {{had given her}} the least encouragement. She's done her best to seduce him to no avail, because Brock is letting the Lord lead him where he's needed rather than where Brock might want to go. Lorie has {{also said that the}} only way to <b>handle</b> <b>Lance</b> is to be indifferent to him. Oddly enough, Lance has told Leslie that the only way for him to treat Lorie is with indifference. Leslie, knowing that Lorie cannot stand to be ignored for long, is fascinated at what the Rome trip portends.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Saxon porker," [...] he said, [...] "is either asleep or minds me not--Prick {{him with}} your lance, De Bracy," [...] {{speaking}} to a knight who rode near him, {{the leader of a}} band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed the point of the <b>lance</b> from the <b>handle.</b> The blood rushed into the countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed, and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.|$|R
