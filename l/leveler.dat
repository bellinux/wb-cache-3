25|$|To be successful, a beaver dam pipe must {{eliminate}} {{the sound and}} feel of water flowing into the pipe. Successful pipe designs (e.g. Flexible Pond <b>Leveler,</b> Castor Master, Clemson Pond <b>Leveler)</b> achieve this by protecting the intake end of the pipe with a cylindrical fence enclosure. A beaver swimming along {{the outside of the}} fence enclosure is unable to hear or feel the flow of water into the pipe and cannot reach it to block it.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond <b>Leveler</b> Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond <b>Leveler</b> Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|A {{thousand}} {{years after the}} death of Sorangath, The Apparitor appeared, heralding the return of The <b>Leveler.</b> Inhabiting the long dead body of Tireces, and assuming all his knowledge, The <b>Leveler</b> became known as Moagim. However, humanity had grown strong, and Moagim knew defeat was imminent. Using black magic, he opened a door into another realm, and found a race of fearless monsters known as Myrkridia. Shortly thereafter, he was captured by the Avatara, and drawn and quartered. However, he had already brought the Myrkridia into the world. Humanity were unprepared for such a vicious foe, and was hunted to near extinction. Only Llancarfan remained of the Cath Bruig Empire. In the mountainous lands of Gower, refugees {{from other parts of the}} world banded together for survival. One {{thousand years}} since the Myrkridia appeared, they remain undefeated in battle, and their numbers continue to grow. Meanwhile, a necromancer calling himself Moagim Reborn has emerged. However, in the western skies, The Apparitor heralds the coming of a new hero.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully installed and maintained beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond <b>Leveler,</b> a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver.|$|E

25|$|However, as {{they return}} from the battle, Connacht realizes Mjarin is the real Leveler; he resurrected Moagim to cover his own machinations. Connacht also learns Myrdred is {{in the service of}} Mjarin. Connacht and his men fight their way to Mjarin, with Connacht {{beheading}} him. The head, however, refuses to die, and so is buried. Myrdred is banished and renamed The Deceiver, whilst Bahl'al is hunted down, and imprisoned beneath the Cloudspine. Connacht becomes Emperor of Llancarfan, which he renames Muirthemne in honour of the dwarven smiths. Years later, Connacht tells Damas to destroy what artifacts of power he can and hide the indestructible ones, explaining that from his knowledge of the Total Codex, he knows he will become the next <b>Leveler,</b> and does not want to have access to any of these items. Connacht presides over a prosperous era known as the Wolf Age, before disappearing into the east, not to be seen again for a thousand years when he would return as Balor, with Damas and Ravanna again by his side as Soulblighter and Shiver.|$|E

Gates married in 1871 to Helen Melvina Batcheller, and they had three children, Oliver, Helen, and Samuel. In 1880, he worked for the Northern Pacific Railway where he was responsible for the locating party through the Cascade Range. The next year Gates started working for the Oregon & Pacific Railroad in Corvallis, first as their locater then as superintendent of construction, and in 1886 he was the railroad's superintendent. Gates continued to work for the railroads, and was responsible for the construction of over 2,000 miles of track from 1891 until 1922.

2500|$|Many {{thousands}} of years since humanity first evolved {{in the world of}} Myth, scholars looking back through its history began to notice a pattern; civilisation would rise, only to be torn down, before again rising. More specifically, they noticed that every thousand years, a powerful being bent only on destruction would conquer humanity, ushering in an age of darkness. This age of darkness would itself last a thousand years, until a hero emerged to lead humanity into an age of light. For a thousand years, humanity would prosper, only to be conquered once again, leading to another thousand years of darkness, and so on. The commencement of each thousand-year cycle is marked by the appearance of a comet in the western skies, [...] "The Apparitor". Believing each evil being to be the same entity in different guises, scholars called him [...] "The Leveler." [...] They noted that each time The <b>Leveler</b> returned, he was more powerful than before, and feared that eventually he would be unstoppable. When Sorangath assumed the mantle of The <b>Leveler,</b> many felt this was the final phase of the cycle. However, Sorangath was defeated by Tireces, and once again, humanity prospered.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical and spectroscopic {{methods are}} {{utilized}} {{to study the}} interaction of three <b>levelers</b> – Dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB), benzyldimethylhexadecyl ammonium chloride (BDAC), and thonzonium bromide (ThonB) – with Cu electrode surfaces.

Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) showed that DTAB exhibits no poten-tial dependent behavior while both BDAC and ThonB exhibit potential dependent behavior. The stability of DTAB, evidenced by the gradual onset Cu deposition and lack of potential dependence in the SERS data, is possibly due to the formation of hemi or pre-micellar structures on the Cu surface. Stabilization of BDAC and ThonB is attained by the electrostatic interactions with the surface as evidenced by the potential dependent behavior exhibited in the SERS.

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of tools needed for agriculture, from {{ploughing}} to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was a plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. It consists of a wooden plank to tie the oxen and an iron bar attached to the plank, that tilled the land. This tool helped to bring the low-lying soil to the upper layer and send the top layer to the bottom, thereby aerating the land. For digging earth, a spade with wooden handle and a sharp terminal was used. A wooden <b>leveler</b> known as palli or maram was used to level the ploughed land. Palliyadutal refers {{to the process of}} removing weeds by means of a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Farmers used a bullock-propelled contrivance called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Water bales were also known as ampi and kilar. [...] Protecting the standing crops from stray animals and birds was an important activity and was carried out by young girls and lower-class peasants. While the young girls used rattles to scare birds away, the Kuravan and Kurathi used a stone-sling device called Kavan to drive away elephants and birds. It is said that an accurate shot from the sling could even kill an animal. Bugles and burning torches were other mechanisms used to keep wild animals away from the fields. Sickles were used for harvesting fully grown paddy and reaping the ripe ears of corn. The paddy grain was separated by thrashing the sheaths on the ground. Ears of millets were stamped on by farm workers and that of black gram were beaten by a stick.|$|E
