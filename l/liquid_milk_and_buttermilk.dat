40|$|It is {{well-documented}} that buttermilk has poor coagulation properties due to {{changes that occur}} to the casein micelles during the butter-making process. These modifications are generally attributed to the pasteurization of the cream upon which interactions between the proteins are promoted. It was hypothesized that churning is also a critical step for the changes that occur in composition of the casein micelles. The objective of this work was {{to learn more about}} the interactions that occur between casein micelles and MFGM components during the butter making process. Raw cream was processed using a rotary churn at 18 °C for approximately 30 minutes, <b>and</b> <b>buttermilk</b> was collected for analysis. Raw milk was skimmed at 10 °C by centrifuging at 3000 x g for 20 minutes. Cream, skim <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> <b>buttermilk</b> were centrifuged at 60, 000 x g for 40 minutes twice using imidazole buffer at pH 6. 8 in order to isolate the micellar content in the pellet. Variation in physical properties of the casein micelles was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer. Protein profiles of UP cream, skim <b>milk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>buttermilk</b> were analyzed using one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique. Experiments were performed using three different batches of UP cream, skim <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> <b>buttermilk.</b> Statistical analyses showed that processing the buttermilk significantly increased the surface charge (P 0. 05). Our results also indicate that churning of cream promoted interactions between casein micelles and MFGM proteins as shown by the more complex 2 D-gel electrophoresis pattern obtained for casein micelles sedimented from buttermilk. This work is significant in its focus of better understanding the functionality changes of valuable milk components during the churning of cream...|$|R

Looks into the smallholder milk processing techniques in the highlands of Ethiopia. It is found that milk produced by smallholders is used for family consumption {{and the production of}} butter and a cottage-type cheese. For butter making, milk is collected over a period of three or four days in a clay pot. When the <b>milk</b> has soured <b>and</b> sufficient <b>milk</b> has been collected, the pot is shaken back and forth until butter granules are formed. The buttermilk remaining after the butter is separated from the whole milk is used to produce a cottage type cheese by heating the <b>buttermilk</b> <b>and</b> separating the coagulated fat and protein from the whey. The various options <b>and</b> outlets for <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> products available to rural smallholder milk producers are shown.

The aim is to find out whether it is possible to reach a 40 percent reduction by 2020 since 1990 in total greenhouse gas emission by changing the production and available consumption of these eight products. The study takes point of origin in data from the year 2012 about the production, import and export of these eight products. This is done in order to find the available consumption of the products too. Then a report calculating a life cycle analysis on food products in Denmark is applied to the statistical data upon production, export and available consumption in order to show the overall environmental impact the production, export and available consumption of these eight products have. Furthermore, four scenarios are mathematical analysed and illustrated in order to show possible ways of reaching a 40 percent reduction in total greenhouse gas by 2020 since 1990. The four scenarios represents a scenario where the total production of the products is reduced, a scenario where the total production exported of the eight products is reduced, a scenario where no actual meat products are produced including pork, beef and poultry and a scenario where no cattle related product are being produced including beef, cheese, butter, <b>liquid</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> preserved <b>milk.</b> The findings of the study conclude {{that it is possible to}} reach a 40 percent reduction before 2020 if: 1) the total production of the eight products is reduced with at least 72. 16 percent, 2) the total production exported of the eight products are reduced with at least 83. 94 percent, 3) the production of pork, beef and poultry stops.
