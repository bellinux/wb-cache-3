5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t <b>like</b> <b>being</b> alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's <b>like</b> <b>being</b> revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
5000|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> with them. He <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> kidded-he <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.https://web.archive.org/web/20021128070101/http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/sunmyungmoon84/OneOfUs.htm ...|$|R

She took the waters at Aachen in Germany on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, <b>like</b> <b>being</b> able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E

25|$|While not {{the fastest}} car all week, the #11 Castrol Holden VR Commodore {{was close to}} the front in most sessions, and the race looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a battle between Wayne Gardner, Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton and the Perkins car. At the start, a minor {{collision}} between Perkins and Lowndes saw the tyre valve from Perkins front right wheel torn off, resulting in the deflation of the tyre, and a slow lap back around to the pits. After replacing the tyre, and checking for other damage, Perkins roared down pit lane, trying to stay on the lead lap, a feat he accomplished.|$|E

He quickly became the break-out star and variety favorite because of his natural optimism and eagerness to learn Korean culture, despite being Canadian-born and completely unfamiliar with the Korean military. In addition, his appearance in Star King further cemented his skills, along with his appearance in Real Men propelled his rising popularity, leading to more variety show opportunities <b>like</b> <b>being</b> chosen as the first guest star in JTBC's Crime Scene and his first solo endorsement opportunity with KFC Korea and netting his second solo endorsement with Sprite Korea.|$|E

25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, <b>like</b> <b>being</b> used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E
25|$|After the {{traditional}} Christmas break, Parma travelled to underachieving Internazionale who {{were led by}} ex-Parma boss Claudio Ranieri and who had not lost the first match back from the break in their 12 openers since 1999, when they were beaten by Parma. That trend never looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> broken as Inter cruised past a hapless Parma side, as the pressure mounted on Franco Colomba, who led the Emaliani to a sixth game without a win. Diego Milito opened the scoring after 13 minutes and grabbed a second 4 minutes before the break, after Thiago Motta had doubled the lead on 18 minutes. Their lead grew to 4 after the break as Giampaolo Pazzini got involved, before novice right-back Marco Faraoni scored a spectacular fifth late on. This result led to the sacking of Franco Colomba on 9 January 2012; he was replaced by Roberto Donadoni.|$|E
25|$|In a {{relatively}} closely fought game at Chelmsford, the Essex team showed more resilience than the visitors, with nearly everyone chipping in {{to give the}} hosts {{a relatively}} comfortable victory. It started with a good bowling effort on the first day, after Ronnie Irani had chosen to put Leicestershire in. It nearly backfired, Darren Robinson and Darren Maddy easing their way to 98 for no loss, but the part-time medium pace of Essex number three Ravinder Bopara got Maddy out, resulting in a mini-collapse to 167 for 8. David Masters (27) and Phil DeFreitas (20) saved the innings somewhat, but Leicestershire's final total of 220 off 81 overs meant that Essex looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in the drivers' seat. Dale Steyn, the young South African pace bowler with three Test caps, took three for 69 on Essex debut, but Darren Gough was the pick of the bowlers with three for 46 - including Robinson, Paul Nixon for a golden duck and DeFreitas.|$|E
