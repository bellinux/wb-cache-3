5|$|In Bloemfontein Spruyt {{worked as}} clerk of the <b>Landdrost</b> (1854–1855), {{and in that}} {{capacity}} he acted {{as secretary of the}} Volksraad on two occasions (September 1854 and February 1855), also filling in as Government Secretary. On the strength of his capacities Spruyt was appointed clerk to the State President in September 1855. Soon after, during the illness of Government Secretary Groenendaal, Spruyt again took up that position. In October 1856 he was appointed to the vacancy and succeeded J. Groenendaal as Government Secretary of the Orange Free State. Spruyt was regarded by his colleagues as an accurate civil servant, but as a lesser politician and statesman, reason that he was not appointed Acting State President when State President Boshoff went on leave in 1858. However, Boshoff trusted Spruyt fully, and he allowed him to represent the presidency in meetings of the Volksraad on several occasions in 1861 and 1862.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax {{payments}} from burghers who were in arrears. Piet Cronjé, a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local <b>landdrost</b> a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their [...] "legal government"—that of the South African Republic—but not to the British [...] "usurper" [...] administration. Kruger and Cronjé knew each other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed. In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher's wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronjé and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon. On hearing of this from Cronjé, Kruger told Joubert: [...] "I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1903 the British {{government}} {{appointed him}} to the legislative council of the colony, and in 1907 after the return to responsible government, Blignaut {{became a member of}} the Legislative Assembly. A better civil servant than politician, his impact on the proceedings of these two institutions was limited.

These districts are again subdivided into wards presided over by field cornets, who exercise judicial powers in minor matters, and in times of war have considerable authority.

60|$|Standerton is {{the first}} town of any size {{on the main road}} from Natal to Pretoria, and is {{situated}} on the north bank of the Vaal River. On the outbreak of hostilities two companies of the 94th and one of the 88th marched from Wackerstroom to this town, and Major Montague of the 94th Regiment arrived from Natal to take the command. The total strength of the garrison consisted of about 350 soldiers and seventy civilians. The <b>Landdrost,</b> J.C. Krogh, remained loyal and assisted in the defence, three forts were erected on eminences round the town, two outworks and many breastworks and rifle-pits were dug, houses interfering with the line of fire were pulled down, and other buildings in suitable positions were barricaded and loop-holed.|$|E
50|$|In February 1804, De Mist {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} which formed several wards {{of the colony}} into a new district which General Janssens named Uitenhage after a title in De Mist's family. He also reorganised other areas, creating Tulbagh in the same year. This was intended to ease administration by dividing the colony into less disparate geographic areas. The settlement was previously divided for magisterial and fiscal purposes into four districts - the Cape, Stellenbosch, Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet, - this reorganisation divided it into six of smaller size and he stantioned <b>landdrosts</b> in the two new districts.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Cape {{legislative}} council, Sir Andries piloted the passage of the Divisional Councils Act, which in his view restored a link {{between the government and the}} governed, which had been broken in 1828 (with the abolition of <b>landdrosts).</b> He also supported the passing of the Burgher Force Bill, which placed the local Cape commandos on an equal footing with the British imperial military. In one of his final political acts, he gave his support to the infant movement for [...] "Responsible Government" [...] in the Cape, as a way to curtail what he saw as the ineptitude and injustice of direct British rule in southern Africa.|$|R

The [...] "officiating {{minister}} for the time being" [...] (there is no word as to his appointment, which was still in the hands of Government) was to preside at all meetings of the vestry. The vestry took over all powers and possessions of the church committee, and was made a corporation capable of suing and being sued. In 1841 the meaning of the words [...] "holding, communion" [...] was queried, and the Attorney-General decided that they did not mean what they said, but that any one professing to be a churchman was a full member of the Church. Governors and colonial chaplains and <b>landdrosts</b> obtaining communion vessels and Royal Engineers (they inspected the building of the church) and pew-rents and church ordinances and secretaries of state for war-it is a queer, mad sort of story ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{and other}} {{passages}} show beyond all doubt from what an awful catastrophe the Transvaal was {{saved by the}} Annexation. That Cetywayo personally detested the Boers is made clear by his words to Mr. Fynney. [...] "'The Boers,' he says, 'are a nation of liars; they are a bad people, bad altogether. I do not want them near my people; they lie and claim what is not theirs, and ill-use my people. Where is Thomas?' (President Burgers). I informed him that Mr. Burgers had left the Transvaal. 'Then let them pack up and follow Thomas,' said he. 'Let them go. The Queen does not want such people as those about her land. What can the Queen make of them or do with them? Their evil ways puzzled both Thomas and Rudolph, <b>Landdrost</b> of Utrecht; {{they will not be}} quiet.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{trenches}} {{had been}} dug and sangars erected to the north-west of the town; but Lord Roberts, {{with his usual}} perverseness, took the wrong turning and appeared upon the broad open plain to the south, where resistance would have been absurd. Already Steyn and the irreconcilables had fled from the town, and the General was met by a deputation of the Mayor, the <b>Landdrost,</b> and Mr. Fraser to tender the submission of the capital. Fraser, a sturdy clear-headed Highlander, {{had been the one}} politician in the Free State who combined a perfect loyalty to his adopted country with a just appreciation of what a quarrel A l'outrance with the British Empire would mean. Had Fraser's views prevailed, the Orange Free State would still exist as a happy and independent State. As it is, he may help her to happiness and prosperity as the prime minister of the Orange River Colony.|$|E
60|$|Prior to the Annexation {{justice was}} {{administered}} {{in a very}} primitive fashion. First, there was the Landdrosts' Court, from which an appeal lay to a court consisting of the <b>Landdrost</b> and six councillors elected by the public. This was a court of first instance {{as well as a}} court of appeal. Then there was a Supreme Court, consisting of three Landdrosts from three different districts, and a jury of twelve selected from the burghers of the State. There was no appeal from this court, but cases have sometimes been brought under the consideration of the Volksraad as the supreme power. It is easy to imagine what the administration of justice was like when the presidents of all the law courts in the country were elected by the mob, not on account of their knowledge of the law, but because they were popular. Suitors before the old Transvaal courts found the law surprisingly uncertain. A High Court of Justice was, however, established after the Annexation, and has been continued by the Volksraad, but an agitation is being got up against it, and it will possibly be abolished in favour of the old system.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{and other}} British figures often contended {{that there were}} more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger's {{administration}} recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged {{that there were more}} uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician James Bryce, most uitlanders saw the country as [...] "virtually English" [...] and perceived [...] "something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors." [...] On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the vierkleur at the city <b>landdrost's</b> office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying. One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: [...] "I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself." [...] The riot was broken up by police and the Chamber of Mines issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying {{only a few of the}} uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as [...] "the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began." ...|$|R
60|$|On the 16th a Boer patrol {{fired on}} some of the mounted infantry, and the fire was returned. These were the first shots fired during the war, and they were fired by Boers. Orders were thereupon signalled to Clarke by Lieutenant-Colonel Winsloe, 21st Regiment, now {{commanding}} at the fort which he afterwards defended so gallantly, that he was to commence firing. Clarke was in the <b>Landdrost's</b> office on the Market Square with a force of about twenty soldiers under Captain Falls and twenty civilians under Captain Raaf, C.M.G., a position but ill-suited for defensive purposes, from whence fire was accordingly opened, the Boers taking up positions in the surrounding houses commanding the office. Shortly after the commencement of the fighting, Captain Falls was shot dead whilst talking to Major Clarke, the latter having a narrow escape, a bullet grazing his head just above the ear. The fighting continued during the 17th and till the morning of the 18th, when the Boers succeeded in firing the roof, which was of thatch, by throwing fire-balls on to it. Major Clarke then addressed the men, telling them that, though personally he did not care about his own life, he did not see that they could serve any useful purpose by being burned alive, so he should surrender, which he did, with a loss of about six killed and wounded. The camp meanwhile had repulsed with loss the attack made on it, and was never again directly attacked.|$|R
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called <b>Landdrosts,</b> whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|R
6000|$|However {{this may}} be, after a pause, {{agitation}} in the Transvaal suddenly recommenced with redoubled vigour. It began through {{a man named}} Bezuidenhout, who refused to pay his taxes. Thereupon a waggon was seized in execution {{under the authority of}} the court and put up to auction, but its sale was prevented by a crowd of rebel Boers, who kicked the auctioneer off the waggon and dragged the vehicle away. This was on the 11th November 1880. When this intelligence reached Pretoria, Sir Owen Lanyon sent down a few companies of the 21st Regiment, under the command of Major Thornhill, to support the <b>Landdrost</b> in arresting the rioters, and appointed Captain Raaf, C.M.G., to act as special messenger to the Landdrost's Court at Potchefstroom, with authority to enrol special constables to assist him to carry out the arrests. On arrival at Potchefstroom Captain Raaf found that, without an armed force, it was quite impossible to effect any arrest. On the 26th November Sir Owen Lanyon, realising the gravity of the situation, telegraphed to Sir George Colley, asking that the 58th Regiment should be sent back to the Transvaal. Sir George replied that he could ill spare it on account of [...] "daily expected outbreak of Pondos and possible appeal for help from Cape Colony," [...] and that the Government must be supported by the loyal inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Pilcher, {{the leader}} of the Douglas raid, was {{inclined}} to explore a little further, and with three squadrons of mounted men he rode on to the eastward. Two commandos, supposed to be Grobler's and Olivier's, were seen by them, moving on a line which suggested {{that they were going to}} join Steyn, who was known to be rallying his forces at Kroonstad, his new seat of government in the north of the Free State. Pilcher, with great daring, pushed onwards until with his little band on their tired horses he found himself in Ladybrand, thirty miles from his nearest supports. Entering the town he seized the <b>landdrost</b> and the field-cornet, but found that strong bodies of the enemy were moving upon him and that it was impossible for him to hold the place. He retired, therefore, holding grimly on to his prisoners, and got back with small loss to the place from which he started. It was a dashing piece of bluff, and, when taken with the Douglas exploit, leads one to hope that Pilcher may have a chance of showing what he can do with larger means at his disposal. Finding that the enemy was following him in force, he pushed on the same night for Thabanchu. His horsemen must have covered between fifty and sixty miles in the twenty-four hours.|$|E
6000|$|Before the {{beginning}} of this story of the most remarkable episodes in his life, Philip Hadden was engaged for several years in transport-riding--that is, in carrying goods on ox waggons from Durban or Maritzburg to various points in the interior. A difficulty such as had more than once confronted him {{in the course of his}} career, led to his temporary abandonment of this means of earning a livelihood. On arriving at the little frontier town of Utrecht in the Transvaal, in charge of two waggon loads of mixed goods consigned to a storekeeper there, it was discovered that out of six cases of brandy five were missing from his waggon. Hadden explained the matter by throwing the blame upon his Kaffir [...] "boys," [...] but the storekeeper, a rough-tongued man, openly called him a thief and refused to pay the freight on any of the load. From words the two men came to blows, knives were drawn, and before anybody could interfere the storekeeper received a nasty wound in his side. That night, without waiting till the matter could be inquired into by the <b>landdrost</b> or magistrate, Hadden slipped away, and trekked back into Natal as quickly as his oxen would travel. Feeling that even here he was not safe, he left one of his waggons at Newcastle, loaded up the other with Kaffir goods--such as blankets, calico, and hardware--and crossed into Zululand, where in those days no sheriff's officer would be likely to follow him.|$|E
6000|$|To {{come to some}} {{evidence}} more recently adduced. On the 9th May 1881, an affidavit was sworn to by the Rev. John Thorne, curate of St. John the Evangelist, Lydenburg, Transvaal, and presented to the Royal Commission appointed to settle Transvaal affairs, in which he states:--"That I {{was appointed to the}} charge of a congregation in Potchefstroom, about thirteen years ago, when the Republic was under the presidency of Mr. Pretorius.[*] I remember noticing one morning, as I walked through the streets, a number of young natives, whom I knew to be strangers. I inquired where they came from. I was told that they had just been brought from Zoutpansberg. This was the locality from which slaves were chiefly brought at that time, and were traded for under the name of 'Black Ivory.' One of these natives belonged to Mr. Munich, the State Attorney. It was a matter of common remark at that time, that the President of the Republic was himself one of the greatest dealers in slaves." [...] In the fourth paragraph of the same affidavit Mr. Thorne says, [...] "That the Rev. Doctor Nachtigal, of the Berlin Missionary Society, was the interpreter for Shatane's people in the private office of Mr. Roth, and, {{at the close of the}} interview, told me what had occurred. On my expressing surprise, he went on to relate that he had information on native matters which would surprise me more. He then produced the copy of a register, kept in the <b>landdrost's</b> office, of men, women, and children, to the number of four hundred and eighty (480), who had been disposed of by one Boer to another for a consideration. In one case an ox was given in exchange, in another goats, in a third a blanket, and so forth. Many of these natives he (Mr. Nachtigal) knew personally. The copy was certified as true and correct by an official of the Republic, and I would mention his name now, only that I am persuaded that it would cost the man his life if his act became known to the Boers." ...|$|R
6000|$|In 1868 {{a public}} meeting {{was held at}} Potchefstroom to {{consider}} the war then {{going on with the}} Zoutpansberg natives. According to the report of the proceedings, the Rev. Mr. Ludorf said that [...] "on a particular occasion a number of native children, who were too young to be removed, had been collected in a heap, covered with long grass, and burned alive. Other atrocities had also been committed, but these were too horrible to relate." [...] When called upon to produce his authority for this statement, Mr. Ludorf named his authority [...] "in a solemn declaration to the State Attorney." [...] At this same meeting Mr. J. G. Steyn, who had been <b>Landdrost</b> of Potchefstroom, said [...] "there now was innocent blood on our hands which had not yet been avenged, and the curse of God rested on the land in consequence." [...] Mr. Rosalt remarked that [...] "it was a singular circumstance that in the different colonial Kafir wars, as also in the Basutu wars, one did not hear of destitute children being found by the commandoes, and asked how it was that every petty commando that took the field in this Republic invariably found numbers of destitute children. He gave it as his opinion that the present system of apprenticeship was an essential cause of our frequent hostilities with the natives." [...] Mr. Jan Talyard said, [...] "Children were forcibly taken from their parents, and were then called destitute and apprenticed." [...] Mr. Daniel Van Nooren was heard to say, [...] "If they had to clear the country, and could not have the children they found, he would shoot them." [...] Mr. Field-Cornet Furstenburg stated [...] "that when he was at Zoutpansberg with his burghers, the chief Katse-Kats was told to come down from the mountains; that he sent one of his subordinates as a proof of amity; that whilst a delay of five days was guaranteed by Commandant Paul Kruger, who was then in command, orders were given {{at the same time to}} attack the natives at break of day, which was accordingly done, but which resulted in total failure." [...] Truly, this must have been an interesting meeting.|$|E
6000|$|Though {{it will be}} {{seen that}} the Boers were on good terms neither with the Zulus nor the Keate Award natives, they still had one Kafir ally, namely, Umbandeni, the Amaswazi king. This {{alliance}} was concluded under circumstances so peculiar that they are worthy of a brief recapitulation. It appears that {{in the winter of}} the year 1875 Mr. Rudolph, the <b>Landdrost</b> of Utrecht, went to Swazieland, and, imitating the example of the Natal Government with Cetywayo, crowned Umbandeni king, on behalf of the Boer Government. He further made a treaty of alliance with him, and promised him a commando to help him in case of his being attacked by the Zulus. Now comes the curious part of the story. On the 18th May 1876, a message came from this same Umbandeni to Sir H. Bulwer, of which the following is an extract:--"We are sent by our king to thank the Government of Natal for the information sent to him last winter by that Government, and conveyed by Mr. Rudolph, of the intended attack on his people by the Zulus. We are further instructed by the king to thank the Natal Government for the influence it used to stop the intended raid, and for instructing a Boer commando to go to his country to render him assistance in case of need; and further for appointing Mr. Randolph {{at the head of the}} commando to place him (Umbandeni) as king over the Amaswazi, and to make a treaty with him and his people on behalf of the Natal Government. [...] . [...] . The Transvaal Government has asked Umbandeni to acknowledge himself a subject of the Republic, but he has distinctly refused to do so." [...] In a minute written on this subject, the Secretary for Native Affairs for Natal says, [...] "No explanation or assurance was sufficient to convince them (Umbandeni's messengers) that they had on that occasion made themselves subjects of the South African Republic; they declared it was not their wish or intention to do so, and that they would refuse to acknowledge a position into which they had been unwittingly betrayed." [...] I must conclude this episode by quoting the last paragraph of Sir H. Bulwer's covering despatch, because it concerns larger issues than the supposed treaty: [...] "It will not be necessary that I should at present add any remarks to those contained in the minute for the Secretary for Native Affairs, but I would observe that the situation arising out of the relations of the Government of the South African Republic with the neighbouring states is so complicated, and presents so many elements of confusion and of danger to the peace of this portion of South Africa, that I trust some way may be found to an early settlement of questions that ought not, in my opinion, to be left alone, as so many have been left, to take the chance of the future." ...|$|E
