[...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie.
