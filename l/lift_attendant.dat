2500|$|At {{that time}} diplomats were {{recruited}} from public schools, and it was said of Bevin {{that it was hard}} to imagine him filling any other job in the Foreign Office except perhaps that of an old and truculent <b>lift</b> <b>attendant.</b> In praise of Bevin, his Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office (Alexander Cadogan) wrote, [...] "He knows a great deal, is prepared to read any amount, seems to take in what he does read, and is capable of making up his own mind and sticking up for his (and our) point of view against anyone." [...] An alternative view is offered by Charmley, who writes that Bevin read and wrote with some difficulty, and that examination of Foreign Office documents shows little sign of the frequent annotations made by Anthony Eden, suggesting that Bevin preferred to reach most of his decisions after oral discussion with his advisers.|$|E
2500|$|In performance, Cardiacs {{generally}} reject (or occasionally parody) standard {{rock band}} posturing. In {{keeping with the}} Alphabet mythology, the band's shows have instead featured behaviour which {{has been described as}} [...] "therapeutic, surrealist pantomime", compared to absurdist theatre, and labelled [...] "not so much theatrically eccentric as completely fucking neurotic". During any given performance, Tim Smith rants between and during numbers, acting out bizarre childlike ideas and emotions. During the 1980s the band perfected a detailed stage act involving shabby <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> costumes, badly-applied clown make-up, Tim Smith's bullying of other band members (predominantly Jim Smith), and a final formal presentation of champagne and flowers by The Consultant and Miss Swift complete with confetti, taking place to [...] "a euphoric sweep of saxophone and keyboards that wouldn’t seem out of place in a '70s cigar advert." [...] During the 1990s, the theatrical elements of the live show were toned down and the uniforms replaced by formal suits, although certain rituals (including the childlike mannerisms and Smith's ranting style) were retained.|$|E
60|$|Bedtime at Roville is an {{hour that}} seems to vary {{according}} to one's proximity to the sea. The gilded palaces along the front keep deplorable hours, polluting the night air till dawn with indefatigable jazz: but at the pensions of the economical like the Normandie, early to bed is the rule. True, Jules, the stout young native who combined the offices of night-clerk and <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> at that establishment, was on duty in the hall throughout the night, but few of the Normandie's patrons made use of his services.|$|E

50|$|The Anchorage Ski Club {{was founded}} in 1937 by Al Corey and Ralph Soberg. It has {{provided}} skiing at Arctic Valley since the 1940s. The club has a long-term lease of more than 500 acre from Chugach State Park. The Anchorage Ski Club also has an area use permit for additional neighboring acreage in Chugach State Park. Ninety percent of the area's operations are volunteered, including ticket sellers, <b>lift</b> <b>attendants,</b> bookkeepers, and maintenance.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} {{pavement}} and entered the <b>lift.</b> The <b>attendant</b> grinned broadly as {{he stopped at the}} eighth floor, and held out his hand for the tip for which Philip had been fumbling. The door of the suite was opened before they could reach the bell. Elizabeth's maid, Phoebe, came forward to take her mistress' cloak, and the floor valet was there to relieve Philip of his overcoat. A waiter was hovering in the background.|$|R

50|$|Like Spirou, Velter {{began his}} career as a <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> at age 16, in the London Ritz Charlton. He later learned the trade as an {{assistant}} to American cartoonist Martin Branner on the Winnie Winkle strip from 1934-1936.|$|E
50|$|Curtis is accosted by a {{young female}} college student who overzealously {{petitions}} him for an audition. Curtis awkwardly escapes {{down a flight of}} stairs. During this time, Kevin visits his father (Jay O. Sanders), a ski <b>lift</b> <b>attendant,</b> in an attempt to gain some advice about his impending divorce from Leanne.|$|E
50|$|Sails allow {{progress}} of a sailing craft to windward, {{thanks to their}} ability to generate lift (and the craft's ability to resist the lateral forces that result). Each sail configuration has a characteristic coefficient of <b>lift</b> and <b>attendant</b> coefficient of drag, which can be determined experimentally and calculated theoretically. Sailing craft orient their sails with a favorable angle of attack between the entry point of the sail and the apparent wind even as their course changes. The ability to generate lift is limited by sailing too close to the wind when no effective angle of attack is available to generate lift (causing luffing) and sailing sufficiently off the wind that the sail cannot be oriented at a favorable angle of attack to prevent the sail from stalling with flow separation.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the negro}} <b>{{attendant}}s</b> <b>lifted</b> {{the lid and}} helped Raymond out. He danced about as if on hot bricks. His body {{was the color of}} a boiled lobster. The attendant put him under one of the showers and turned the water on. Raymond uttered one deep, low, [...] "O-o-o-o!" [...] Then McCord begged to be let out; Weir's big head, with its shock of hair, resembled that of an angry lion; little Trace screamed, and Duncan yelled.|$|R

The ability to generate lift is limited by sailing too close to the wind when no effective angle of attack is available to generate lift (luffing) and sailing sufficiently off the wind that the sail cannot be oriented at a favorable angle of attack (running downwind). Instead, past a critical angle of attack, the sail stalls and promotes flow separation.|$|R
50|$|After World War I Sharkey {{moved to}} Sydney and {{obtained}} {{a job as}} a <b>lift</b> <b>attendant,</b> also becoming a militant activist in the Sydney Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union. In 1922 Sharkey {{became a member of the}} Sydney labor union council. Sharkey was elected to the executive of the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, but lost that post in another election in 1925. In 1928 he became a union delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|The friends {{convince}} the ski <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> {{to let them}} on one last time. Before the group gets {{all the way to}} the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.|$|E
5000|$|In 1898 the [...] "Bergen {{exhibition}}" [...] {{changed the}} park into an exhibition area. With a ticket costing 50 øre you could visit a small zoo and a botanical garden, study objects from Nansen's polar expeditions, {{and take the}} elevator to the top of Wisbech & Meinich's [...] "Panorama tower with electric elevator". A <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> in uniform was in charge of what was most likely the first elevator in Bergen. Norway's first elevator was namely produced in the same year, in Wisbech's factory in Christiania.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} a woman came up {{to say that the}} palanquin was in {{readiness}} at the gate of the zenana garden. A large cushion was taken off a divan, and Isobel was laid upon it and covered with a light shawl. Six of the female <b>attendants</b> <b>lifted</b> it and carried it downstairs, accompanied by Rabda and the mistress off the zenana, both closely veiled. Outside the gate was a large palanquin, with its bearers and four soldiers and an officer. The cushion was lifted and placed in the palanquin, and Rabda also took her place there.|$|R
40|$|Microfilm is deadly. Deadly for the eyes, {{the brain}} and, as I {{recently}} learned {{here on a}} research jaunt to Beijing, the stomach. So when a CD booklet on the bar of a Haidian district livehouse caught my weary eye I thought I’d found a good wall ornament for the apartment and a better image to set my evenings eyes on. The only problem was the insert – a black 2 ̆ 6 white sketch of a mass of punks tossing Molotovs at a grinning Mao – wasn’t big enough. I was thinking poster size, so I {{took it to the}} first place that came to mind: my local Beijing Kinko’s. The <b>attendant</b> <b>lifted</b> the thing to her face and, yes, things got uncomfortable. There was no mistaking the message on the graphic’s palace backdrop to the Chairman: fanzui xiangfa, pohuai (criminals minds, destroy). And I felt a bit awkward walking in as an American with this suggestive graphic, so I made sure the staff took in the CD cover: two hands, a bloodied hatchet and the head of George W. Bush. These rockers were clearly out for everyone. The manager and attendant conferred in mutters while a third staffer busied himself with the printed album lyrics, half rendered in English. (E. g. “Kill your Television. We sit back passively as OUR culture is commoditized and force-fed back to us. We have nothing to talk about except TV’s imaginary lives that are safe and sanitized, while the real hours of our own lives are sold away as advertising space to corporations. Our lives become the commodity as the things we buy, the words we speak and the way we live all become reflections of what we watch. Smash your TV and live YOUR life!”; or “We destroy the red dream… The dream turned into a nightmare without end. Now it’s time to destroy this dream gone stale. Smash it up and find a new way!”...|$|R
5000|$|When the Doctor {{arrives in}} the lift, he says [...] "First Floor, Perfumery", {{in the manner of}} a {{department}} store <b>lift</b> <b>attendant.</b> This method of announcing both floor and departments found thereon is also used as the basis of the theme music to the BBC situation comedy [...] "Are You Being Served?". Since Britons typically use the phrase [...] "ground floor" [...] to describe what Americans would call [...] "the first floor", the line is an ostensible Americanisation of the [...] "Are You Being Served?" [...] theme's first verse, which begins with the words, [...] "Ground Floor, Perfumery".|$|E
50|$|The {{ski area}} {{was started by}} Chuck Stone, who {{discovered}} the sport as a child recovering from polio, and {{had worked as a}} <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> at Suicide Six in Vermont. Returning to Minneapolis, he wanted to start a ski area, and went to the public library to search out viable topography. The present ski area of Buck Hill was the tallest hill close to the Twin Cities, but was on private land, part of a remote farm owned by Grace Whittier. Stone (and his fiancée Nancy) convinced Ms. Whittier to lease them the property, succeeding where previous wooers had failed, and the ski area began operating in 1954. Ms. Whittier left the property to St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minnesota, upon her death.|$|E

50|$|Poirot and Hastings are {{in their}} rooms with a neighbour, Dr Hawker, when the medical man's {{housekeeper}} arrives with the message that a client, Count Foscatini, has phoned for the doctor, crying out for help. Poirot, Hastings and Hawker rush to Foscatini's flat in Regent's Court. The <b>lift</b> <b>attendant</b> there, unaware of any problems, says that Graves, the Count's man, left half an hour earlier with no indication of anything wrong. The flat is locked but {{the manager of the}} building opens it for them. Inside, they find a table set for three people, with the meals finished. The Count is alone and dead - his head crushed in by a small marble statue. Poirot is interested in the remains on the table. He questions the kitchen staff {{at the top of the}} building. They describe the meal they served and the dirty plates passed up to them in the service elevator. Poirot seems especially interested in the fact that little of the side dish and none of the dessert were eaten, while the main course was consumed entirely. He also points out that after crying out for help on the phone, the dying man replaced the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this point}} {{he took to}} using the name Owen Evans, and worked briefly for British Rail before again trying the armed forces. The Royal Air Force {{accepted}} him in July 1959, but discharged him after four months as [...] "physically unfit for Air Force service". It was during a series of short-term jobs around Workington from September 1960 that Evans briefly worked for the Lakeland Laundry and came to know Jack West. He soon left and moved to Birmingham in October 1961 and there worked as a kitchen porter, driver and <b>lift</b> <b>attendant.</b> On 5 April 1963 as Gwyn Evans he was convicted by Carlisle magistrates of larceny of 5s cash, and obtaining 16s. cash and a railway ticket by false pretences. He was fined £5 with four days' detention in default; he chose to serve the four days. He had stolen two half crowns from a friend while he was distracted, and obtained a 16s loan from a police station by claiming to have lost his wallet at his mother's funeral. In the following month Evans was given three months' imprisonment at Dudley for driving a motor vehicle without a licence, and using a driving licence with intent to deceive. Evans enlisted again, into the Lancastrian Brigade, in October 1963 but was discharged on 14 November 1963 when his criminal convictions and failure to disclose them came to light.|$|E
