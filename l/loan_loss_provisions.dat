40|$|This Thesis is a both {{timely and}} {{warranted}} examination of ‘risk management behaviour’ in Greek banking inter-linking cost efficiencies with <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> practices during 2005 to 2012. Firstly, utilising Stochastic Frontier Analysis, we construct numerous cost efficiency frontiers {{and examine the}} evolution of cost efficiency in the banking system. Secondly, we investigate the risk management behaviour and the dominant <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> practises in the domestic banking sector. These include capital management, efficiency hypotheses and the cyclicality of <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning.</b> Finally, we investigate the evolution of non-performing loans {{and if they are}} Granger caused by bad management or cost skimping within our construct of risk management behaviour. During 2005 to 2012 the ‘four core’ banks record strong performances and operate at higher levels of cost efficiency than their domestic competitors. This gap was reduced after the 2008 and 2010 financial crises, thus indicating an adverse impact due to the Private Sector Involvement. Overall, despite the so called bond haircut, the Greek banking system still recorded a strong performance where many banks operated close to the optimal efficiency levels, despite the ongoing deepening economic recession. In addition risk bank management behaviour presents <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> practices that are counter cyclical to the Greek business cycle.

Our estimated results {{do not support the}} capital management and signalling hypotheses. We also find that the global crisis has contributed significantly to the procyclicality of loan loss provisioning in Albania and banks continued to do income smoothing during the crisis...|$|E
3000|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>Loss</b> Reserve/Loans (100 ×) It is {{the ratio}} of the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provision</b> to the total balance of loans. Since this {{variable}} is not available for all banks, we capitalize the volume of impairment provisions of the last three years and substitute this amount in the numerator. It provides a reasonable adjustment for the cases of banks with actual data on LLR. The variable is winsorized at 1 [...]...|$|R
40|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>Loss</b> <b>Provisioning</b> (LLP) is {{an amount}} of reserve that banks "put aside" to cover loss in case that loan goes in default, meaning that clients do not repay it. It is a safety buffer for {{preserving}} banks liquidity and capital adequacy. On the other hand, the <b>Loan</b> <b>Loss</b> <b>Provisioning</b> is a cost. In the Profit and Lost statement of banks, LLP decreases profit. It is a good tool/mechanism for risk management, but also expensive one, {{and that is why}} it is important for banks to optimize it in every possible way. The aim of optimization is to distribute collateral value to the connected loans, in a way to minimize amount of LLP. It can be done easily on a one loan level, but creating a universal algorithm that is applicable to all loans and all collaterals on the Bank portfolio level, is the goal to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> {{behaviour}} {{of banks}} in Tanzania to understand if it follows income smoothing, business cycle or capital management hypothesis. It also {{looks at the}} impact of efficiency on provisioning behaviour. Data from 26 banks over a 7 year period from 2009 to 2015 were {{used to calculate the}} estimates of efficiency through Stochastic Frontier Analysis. These values were then included in a <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> model with other independent variables and observed through the General Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. The results showed that banks are overall efficient, with efficiency improving from 0. 863 in 2009 to 1. 126 in 2015. The second part of the paper showed that Tanzanian banks exhibited procyclicality and capital management hypothesis. While the lags were insignificant, efficiency was positive and significant. This shows the importance of including them in the paper and the misleading effects its omission could have...|$|R
