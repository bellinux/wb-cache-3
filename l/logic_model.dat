The underlying purpose of constructing a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is to assess how a program's activities will affect its outcomes.

40|$|Motivation: <b>Logic</b> <b>modeling</b> is {{a useful}} tool to study signal transduc-tion across {{multiple}} pathways. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> can be generated by training a network containing the prior knowledge to phospho-prote-omics data. The training can be performed using stochastic optimiza-tion procedures, but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models. This, however, is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal transduction and generate reliable predictions. Results: We propose the use of Answer Set Programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> Toward this end, we have developed caspo, an open-source Python package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> by lever-aging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of Answer Set Programming.

40|$|Mining large {{datasets}} using {{machine learning}} approaches often leads to models {{that are hard to}} interpret and not amenable to the generation of hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. We present ‘Logic Optimization for Binary Input to Continuous Output’ (LOBICO), a computational approach that infers small and easily interpretable <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> of binary input features that explain a continuous output variable. Applying LOBICO to a large cancer cell line panel, we find that logic combinations of multiple mutations are more predictive of drug response than single gene predictors. Importantly, we show that the use of the continuous information leads to robust and more accurate <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> LOBICO implements the ability to uncover <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> around predefined operating points in terms of sensitivity and specificity. As such, it represents an important step towards practical application of interpretable <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatic...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{scholars}} of nonprofit organizational effectiveness {{acknowledge that the}} concept has multiple dimensions [...] and multiple definitions. For example, while most nonprofit leaders define organizational effectiveness as 'outcome accountability,' or {{the extent to which}} an organization achieves specified levels of progress toward its own goals, a minority of nonprofit leaders define effectiveness as 'overhead minimization,' or the minimization of fundraising and administrative costs. Hence,Organizational effectiveness is typically evaluated within nonprofit organizations using <b>logic</b> <b>models.</b> <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are a management tool widely used in the nonprofit sector in program evaluation. <b>Logic</b> <b>models</b> are created for specific programs to link specific, measurable inputs to specific, measurable impacts. Typically, <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> specify how program inputs, such as money and staff time, produce activities and outputs, such as services delivered, which in turn lead to impacts, such as improved beneficiary health.|$|R
5000|$|Creating a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is a {{wonderful}} way to help visualize important aspects of programs, especially when preparing for an evaluation. An evaluator should create a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> with input from many different stake holders. Logic Models have 5 major components: Resources or Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Short-term outcomes, and Long-term outcomes [...] Creating a <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> helps articulate the problem, the resources and capacity that are currently being used to address the problem, and the measurable outcomes from the program. Looking at the different components of a program in relation to the overall short-term and long-term goals allows for illumination of potential misalignments. Creating an actual <b>logic</b> <b>model</b> is particularly important because it helps clarify for all stakeholders: the definition of the problem, the overarching goals, and the capacity and outputs of the program.|$|E

The transparency and user-centricity of quantitative models of Software Engineering are of paramount relevancy as they help us gain a better and more comprehensive insight into the revealed relationships characteristic to software quality and software processes. In this study, we are concerned with logic-driven architectures of <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> based on fuzzy multiplexers (FMUXs). Those constructs exhibit a clear and modular topology whose interpretation {{gives rise to a}} collection of straightforward logic expressions. The design of the <b>logic</b> <b>models</b> is based on the genetic optimization and genetic algorithms, in particular.
