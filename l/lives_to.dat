5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.|$|E

5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view.

They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

Pounder), a fellow Group member who has worked with them in the past. She offers her help but Watts declines it. Watts is later able to access Schlossburg's computer files; meanwhile, the doctor is found to be alive, regaining consciousness in a hospital bed and telling police his assailant was Watts.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E

5|$|During a {{subsequent}} confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, Armidale {{was struck by}} two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He {{made his way to}} the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, {{writes that}} the novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of theosophy and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E

5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When {{atmospheric}} pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} side-scrolling shoot 'em up and {{revolves}} around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman. The game features {{a total of five}} levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles, in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out.

5|$|Typhoon Nepartak, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Weng, was a modest {{tropical}} cyclone that struck the central Philippines and the southern China island of Hainan in November 2003. Forming as a tropical depression on November 11 between Yap and Guam, the system moved westward and slowly intensified. It received the name Nepartak midday on November 12 from the Japan Meteorological Agency, becoming the 20th named storm of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. On November 13, Napartak struck Samar in the Philippines and bisected the island chain. Up to four million people lost power, and transportation ground to a halt; over 5,000 individuals became stranded on ships forced to stay in port during the tropical storm. It was reported that 13 individuals lost their <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> the storm in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
