40|$|Pallets of {{automatic}} transfer lines {{serve as the}} technological and work-transfer equipment. However, their design {{is based on the}} general principles of designing machine accessories. Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the <b>clamping</b> <b>locks</b> of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a clamping load is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> play length when the lead-in chamfer contacts the bushing chamfer; - a <b>clamping</b> <b>lock</b> play length over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> These calculations made it possible to calculate the required diameter of the <b>clamping</b> <b>lock.</b> The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|R
50|$|The FN40GL {{is deemed}} a third {{generation}} grenade launcher, meaning it is multifunctional: {{it can be}} used mounted to the rifle or as a standalone system; it is manufactured using a number of materials like aluminum, composites, and polymers; the breech opens to the side for use of longer 40 mm rounds including less-lethal; and it is mounted on the bottom accessory rail instead of requiring specialized mounting hardware. The FN40GL is attached to SCAR rifles on the bottom rail with a trigger adapter and dual <b>locking</b> <b>clamp</b> levers on the launcher, limiting the ability to integrate with other rifles. Barrel length is 9.6 in, and is unique in that it is the only system where the barrel can swivel to the left or right for loading, while other breech loading launchers pivot specifically to one side. This enhances its ambidextrousness, making it easy for a left-handed operator to load under fire. The standalone stock assembly has the FN40GL mounted to the bottom rail as with the rifle, but still has 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 9 o’clock rail positions for other accessories. This is mainly during non-lethal uses for other mounted additions like LED lights and laser dazzlers. The trigger is placed lower than normal for operation with the user's middle finger, while keeping their trigger finger free to use the rifle. The double-action trigger is long and heavy to prevent easily and unintentionally firing a round under stress.|$|E
40|$|In groundbased {{tactical}} {{situations and}} prehospital settings, the tourniquet {{is used as}} a life-saving hemorrhage control device. It must completely stop blood flow, must be fast and simple to self-apply, and must require minimal training. However, an improperly designed or used tourniquet can cause loss of the limb, compromised limb salvage, and systemic effects harmful to the patient; all may result from excess tourniquet pressure, excess tourniquet time, or a tourniquet that is too narrow. Most existing prehospital tourniquets use technology from the 1800 ’s: mechanically tightened narrow bands that apply uncontrolled pressures (e. g. Spanish Windlass). In contrast, the modern pneumatic tourniquet is considered indispensable in common surgical procedures, and is now used thousands of times each day to completely occlude arterial blood flow in limbs continuously throughout surgeries lasting several minutes to several hours, and longer using appropriate techniques. Injury or compromise of limb recovery due to pneumatic tourniquet use in surgery is rare.

40|$|The Paris-Edinburgh cell (PEC) is {{a widely}} used opposed-anvil device for neutron scattering. Since its development, {{it has been used}} to study a number of samples loaded as solids or liquids. However, {{studying}} gases at room temperature has not yet been possible. Up until now only a few gases could be loaded as liquids, in cryogenic conditions. Thus, it was impossible to study many gases and gas mixtures and also it was difficult to use gases as pressure-transmitting media (PTM). In order to overcome these limitations, a technique that would enable loading of gases into the PEC was required. The work described in this thesis was focused on the design and use of a gas-loading system for the PEC. The challenge of designing such a system {{comes from the fact that}} the gases need to be loaded into the gasket at sufficient density in order to achieve any significant pressure during further compression in the cell. This can be achieved by using a separate pressure vessel. Because the whole PEC is too large to be placed inside the vessel, a technique of loading gas into the anvils separated from the rest of the cell had to be devised. Designing the holder for the anvils, which would make this possible, presented a major challenge as it should allow the anvils to be transferred between the vessel and the PEC, with the gasket filled with high-pressure gas. Then it needs to allow further compression of the gasket inside the PEC. The developed system consists of a pressure vessel and a <b>locking</b> <b>clamp</b> for the anvils. The pressure vessel is a closed-end thick-walled cylinder with a top cover which has an opening for a piston. The vessel is placed on the table of a hydraulic press and the piston, sealed by a high-pressure reciprocating seal, is used to transmit the force from hydraulic ram onto the anvils which are held by the clamp and placed inside the vessel. One of the anvils is fixed to the clamp and the other one is supported by spring-loaded latches - the latches engage when the anvils are pushed towards each other. Thus, when the force is applied onto the anvils to compress the gasket, latches lock the anvils in their positions stopping them from retracting and maintaining the gasket compressed after the force is released. The clamp allows the gasket to be filled with the gas and then deformed to seal the compressed gas. The locking mechanism keeps the gasket compressed, which enables the clamp to be transferred from the vessel to the PEC. After the system was built and tested, it was installed at ISIS neutron source (Oxfordshire, UK), where it has been used in several experiments. The first experiment prepared with the gas-loading system was a neutron diffraction study of nitrogen at high pressure. Nitrogen was chosen as a sample material because its high-pressure structural phase diagram is well established. Nitrogen was loaded into the gasket using the gas loader and then it was compressed in increments to 6 GPa in the PEC. β and δ phases of solid nitrogen were clearly seen in the collected neutron diffraction data. The experiment proved the usability of the gas-loading system and verified its expected performance. The second experiment utilizing the gas-loading system was to study singlecrystal and powder samples of sodium chloride (NaCl) and squaric acid (H 2 C 4 O 4). For these studies argon was used as a PTM, replacing the conventionally used methanol-ethanol mixture (ME). Up until this experiment the highest pressure reported in single-crystal neutron-scattering experiments was 12 GPa. This limit was set by the solidi cation pressure of ME. With argon as the PTM, the samples were compressed to 15 GPa without any damage to the crystals. Another advantage of replacing ME with argon is improved hydrostaticity. The highest pressure that ME remain hydrostatic to is 11 GPa. Compressing beyond this point causes sheer stress acting on the sample which affects the quality of the neutron scattering data manifested in the appearance of peak-broadening in the diffraction patterns. With use of argon, the powder samples have been compressed to 18 GPa while maintaining quasi-hydrostatic pressure conditions, resulting in clean and sharp diffraction patterns without any noticeable peak-broadening.

40|$|Animal {{attachment}} to a substrate {{is very different}} in terrestrial and aquatic environments. We discuss variations in both the forces acting to detach animals and forces of attachment. While in a terrestrial environment gravity is commonly understood {{as the most important}} detachment force, under submerged conditions gravity is nearly balanced out by buoyancy and therefore matters little. In contrast, flow forces such as drag and lift are of higher importance in an aquatic environment. Depending on the flow conditions, flow forces can reach much higher values than gravity and vary in magnitude and direction. For many of the attachment mechanisms (adhesion including glue, friction, suction and mechanical principles such as hook, <b>lock,</b> <b>clamp</b> and spacer) significant differences have to be considered under water. For example, the main principles of dry adhesion, van der Waals forces and chemical bonding, which make a gecko stick to the ceiling, are weak under submerged conditions. Capillary forces are very important for wet adhesion, e. g., in terrestrial beetles or flies, but usually do not occur under water. Viscous forces are likely an important contributor to adhesion under water in some mobile animals such as torrent frogs and mayflies, but there are still many open questions to be answered. Glue is the dominant attachment mechanism of sessile aquatic animals and the aquatic realm presents many challenges to this mode of attachment. Viscous forces and the lack of surface tension under submerged conditions also affect frictional interactions in the aquatic environment. Moreover, the limitation of suction to the pressure difference at vacuum conditions can be ameliorated under water, due to the increasing pressure with water depth...|$|R

The vibration absorber consists of mass block, cantilever beam, magnet lock system, vibration and distance sensors, controller and servo motor.

Portion of cantilever was cut in form of gear tracks, which can be driven by servo motor through transmit gear to regulate the length of the cantilever beam, and the natural frequency of absorber will also be regulated.

40|$|Abstract At {{the plant}} of Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB in Molkom {{a wide range}} of butt weld {{fittings}} are produced. These are aimed mainly for the process industries and one of the products are ninety degree bend elbows in various dimensions. The elbows are made from stainless sheet metal and when formed to a tube they need to be welded along its inner radius. This is made by a pick and place type industrial robot working in a closed compartment. The assignment given by Outokumpu aims to investigate and suggest a new concept for a more reliable manufacturing process within the work cell.   The cell consists of five main areas chronologically listed as passed by the elbow: ·          Automated, vibrating conveyor. ·          Fixture with the purpose to serve the robot with one elbow at a time, placed in the correct position. ·          Industrial robot to pick up the elbow and drag it along the welding head. ·          TIG inverter with a stationary welding head·          A hydraulic press with a template of the final shape of the elbow corrects flaws.  Almost every problem in the cell and defects on the products coming out of it {{can be traced back to}} the fixture and in some cases also to the robots pick up tooling. The focus of the task was therefore put mainly on those two areas. As the work proceeded Outokumpu chose to develop a new tool for the robot themselves which they did with good results. I chose to incorporate it into my study and change focus to the fixture instead.   The problems and possible causes to them were identified and discussed with my tutor: The elbows fall incorrectly into or beside of the fixture.   Fixtures are old and worn down. The elbows path between conveyor and fixture are somewhat out of control The smaller dimensions have room enough to slip past the fixture. Edges to be welded are to far from each other or badly shaped Commissioning time, some start up steps is more complex then they need to be. Some of the setting possibilities in the working cell are unnecessary and can be fixed instead. The positions of pick up and welding head are not really fixed in the robot software, these are reprogrammed every time elbow size are changed. ·          Various errors at weldingo    Robot managed to pick incorrectly placed elbow   Proposals to solve the above specified problems: All parts in contact with the elbows are to be made of harden able steel. A suitable one is C 45 E which can be casehardened to about 700 HV. On the outer edge of the conveyer a support are placed to prevent excessive wear. The fixture is partially redesigned with a support to control the elbows path better. Guide arms with dual purpose are added. First they guide the elbow into the fixture and secondly they turn it to the correct angle towards the robot. Pins are used along with quick <b>lock</b> <b>clamps</b> to obtain faster and easier commissioning. The pick and place tool developed by Outokumpu are used...|$|R
50|$|How: Normally {{front-wheel drive}} vehicle. A Haldex Traction LSC unit may divert up {{to a maximum}} 100% of the torque to the rear axle as {{conditions}} warrant. Many people find the torque distribution on Haldex Traction systems confusing. Under normal operating conditions, the Haldex LSC clutch operates at 5% (divide 5% between front and rear, and 97.5% torque goes to the front, and 2.5% goes to the rear). Under adverse conditions where both front wheels lose traction, the Haldex clutch can <b>lock</b> at 100% <b>clamping</b> force. This means, that {{since there is no}} torque transferred to the front axle, all torque (minus losses) must be transferred to the rear axle. The torque split between left and right wheels is achieved with a conventional open differential. If one side of the driven axle loses grip, then the Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) controls this. EDL brakes a single spinning wheel, and therefore torque gets transferred to the opposite wheel via the open differential. On all transverse-engined cars with the Haldex Traction LSC four-wheel drive system, the EDL only controls the front wheels, and not the rear.|$|R

The clamping force is generated by a rotational electrostatic comb-drive actuator and can be latched passively by a parallel plate type electrostatically driven <b>locking</b> device. The <b>clamp</b> design {{is based on the}} principles of exact constraint design, resulting in a high actuation compliance (flexibility) combined with a high suspension stiffness. Therefore, a relatively large blocking force of 1. 4 mN in relation to the used area of 1. 8 mm 2 is obtained. The fabrication is based on silicon bulk micromachining technology and combines a high-aspect-ratio deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), conformal deposition of low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride and an anisotropic potassium hydroxide (KOH) backside etching technology. Special attention is given to void reduction of SixNy trench isolation and reduction of heating phenomena during front-side release etching. Guidelines are given for the applied process. Measurements showed that the clamp was able to fix, hold and release a test actuator. The dynamic behavior was in good agreement with the modal analysis...|$|R
