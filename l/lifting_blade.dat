40|$|The {{perpendicular}} {{interaction of}} a streamwise vortex {{with the tip}} of a <b>lifting</b> <b>blade</b> was studied in incompressible flow to provide information useful to the accurate prediction of helicopter rotor noise and the understanding of vortex dominated turbulent flows. The vortex passed 0. 3 chord lengths to the suction side of the blade tip, providing a weak interaction. Single and two-point turbulence measurements were made using sub-miniature four sensor hot-wire probes 15 chord lengths downstream of the blade trailing edge; revealing the mean velocity and Reynolds stress tensor distributions of the turbulence, as well as its spanwise length scales as a function of frequency. The single point measurements show the flow downstream of the blade to be dominated by the interaction of the original tip vortex and the vortex shed by the blade. These vortices rotate about each other under their mutual induction, winding up the turbulent wakes of the blades. This interaction between the vortices appears to be the source of new turbulence in their cores and in the region between them. This turbulence appears to be responsible for some decay in the core of the original vortex, not seen when the blade is removed. The region between the vortices is not only a region of comparatively large stresses, but also one of intense turbulence production. Velocity autospectra measured near its center suggests the presence quasi-periodic large eddies with axes roughly parallel to a line joining the vortex cores. Detailed two-point measurements were made on a series of spanwise cuts through the flow so as to reveal the turbulence scales as they would be seen along the span of an intersecting airfoil. The measurements were made over a range of probe separations that enabled them to be analyzed {{not only in terms of}} coherence and phase spectra but also in terms of wave-number frequency (kappa-omega) spectra, computed by transforming the measured cross-spectra with respect to the spanwise separation of the probes. These data clearly show the influence of the coherent eddies in the spiral wake and the turbulent region between the cores. These eddies produce distinct peaks in the upwash velocity kappa-omega spectra, and strong anisotropy manifested both in the decay of the kappa-omega spectrum at larger wave-numbers and in differences between the kappa-omega spectra of different components. None of these features are represented in the von Karman spectrum for isotropic turbulence that is often used in broadband noise computations. Wave-number frequency spectra measured in the cores appear to show some evidence that the turbulence outside sets tip core waves, as has previously been hypothesized. These spectra also provide for the first time a truly objective method for distinguishing velocity fluctuations produced by core wandering from other motions...|$|E

The {{prediction method}}s for the individual self-noise mechanisms are semiempirical and are based on previous theoretical studies and data obtained from tests of two- and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections. The self-noise mechanisms are due to specific boundary-layer phenomena, that is, the boundary-layer turbulence passing the trailing edge, separated-boundary-layer and stalled flow over an airfoil, vortex shedding due to laminar boundary layer instabilities, vortex shedding from blunt trailing edges, and the turbulent vortex flow existing near the tip of <b>lifting</b> <b>blades.</b> The predictions are compared successfully with published data from three self-noise studies of different airfoil shapes.

40|$|The 5 -seater Aerospatiale AS 350 B {{helicopter}} {{has been}} chosen {{in this analysis}} in order to investigate {{the capabilities of the}} vortex trap in increasing the helicopter <b>blade</b> <b>lift.</b> <b>Blade</b> Element Theory (BET) was applied to scrutinize the lift force and angle of attack distribution along the helicopter blade. From BET, the retreating blade must operate at a higher coefficient of lift for the purpose to balance the lift force {{on both sides of the}} rotor. In the process of designing and analyzing the grooyer,, commercial CFD, Fluent 6. 3 and pre-processor Gambit were utilised in order to investigate the effect of groove which was applied on the upper surface of the helicopter airfoil. The Shear-Stress Transport (SST) k - o turbulence model was utilized in this analysis because of its capability in producing the flow inside the groove and the ability on predicting the separation of the airfoil. The mesh sensitivity analysis had also been accounted in the numerical study. The optimization of the groove was done by analyzing the numbers and locations of the grooves, the design depth and length of the groove and modification of the groove shape to smoothen the velocities flow. Finally, the data from BET was used with data from numerical analysis to obtain the lift force achieved by the vortex trap method to increase the <b>lift</b> of helicopter <b>blade.</b> Thus, the small increment of lift was achieved when applying groove on the upper surface of the retreating blade due to the small area contribution at high angle of attack...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of the mating of the blade of an OWT by a floating installation vessel. A {{state of the art}} analysis of the current practices in the industry shows that jack-up vessels are preferred when it comes to top turbine installation. As the mating of the top turbine components happens at large heights and needs a high degree of precision, the use of jack-up crane vessels that have no wave-induced motions seems relevant. However, the drawbacks of the jack-up operations, such as the important time spent in the leg deployment and the costs of such operations, motivated the writer of this thesis to look for other innovative installation methods. The modeling of a innovative design of tower ring concept, introduced by De Groot, is realized to assess the feasibility of blade mating with floating vessel. This modeling, performed {{with the use of the}} software SIMO, leads to the establishment of the limiting environmental conditions for performing the operation. The results show that the impact of the turbulent wind on the <b>lifted</b> <b>blade</b> is not as critical as the impact of the vessel motions due to the waves. These wave-induced motions are even more critical when the waves are coming from the side of the moored installation vessel. The comparison with the jack-up installation shows that jack-up operations accept limiting sea states of wider significant wave heights and peak periods than the floating vessel installation. One additional problem of the floating vessel is the effect of the mean wave direction, which can limit drastically the allowable sea states when the vessel is not facing the waves. However, the operational time with floating vessels is almost divided by half for a total wind turbine installation compared with the jack-up vessels. The relevance of floating vessels for OWT installation must therefor continue to be investigated...|$|R

50|$|In {{small-scale}} tests, cyclorotors {{achieved a}} higher power loading than comparable scale traditional rotors at the same disk loading.
