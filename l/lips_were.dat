The video was created by Jay Subiyakto, who spliced together archived footage of Chrisye performing. Chrisye's <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> synchronised to move {{in time with the}} vocals. Subiyakto stated that he did not base the work on foreign shows, choosing instead to start from scratch. The music was provided by a live orchestra.|$|E
500|$|... was an {{impulsive}} young man. From rare {{photographs and}} {{the testimony of}} his contemporaries emerges [...] a figure of medium stature, with slightly drooped shoulders, thick brown hair, and a pale oval face. His eyebrows were dark, {{and one of them}} was almost always raised, giving his face an expression of intense irony. His eyes burned with constant passion, and his <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in his smile. He smiled often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lips</b> <b>are</b> {{often viewed}} {{as a symbol of}} sensuality and sexuality. This has many origins; above all, the <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> a very {{sensitive}} erogenous and tactile organ. Furthermore, in many cultures of the world, a woman's mouth and <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> veiled because of their representative association with the vulva, and because of their role as a woman's secondary sexual organ.|$|R
500|$|The {{theme song}} was {{composed}} by Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith, while {{the lyrics to}} the song were written by series creator Stephen Hillenburg and the series' original creative director Derek Drymon. The melody {{was inspired by the}} sea shanty [...] "Blow the Man Down". An old oil painting of a pirate is used in the opening sequence. It has been dubbed [...] "Painty the Pirate", and according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift shop [...] "years ago". Patrick Pinney gives voice to Painty the Pirate, singing the theme song as the character. Hillenburg's <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> imposed onto the painting and move along with the lyrics. Kenny joked that this is [...] "about as close of a glimpse as most SpongeBob fans are ever going to get of Steve Hillenburg", because of Hillenburg's private nature.|$|E
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to Rinder, executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably and his <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> so completely blue that he was incapable of talking". (The executive in question denied to the Tampa Bay Times that this incident had ever happened).|$|E
500|$|Elements of Rocky Horror were {{sanitized}} for the episode, and Shankman {{believes that}} he was sought out {{in order to make}} the production more audience appropriate. Stamos was initially set to play Dr. Frank N. Furter, but the role was recast due to network resistance. Costumes used in the episode were inspired by the Rocky Horror musical and film, but were adapted for the Glee cast and cost over $30,000. The tight gold lam√© underwear worn by Peter Hinwood in the 1975 film were replaced by board shorts for Overstreet. In dressing Riley as Frank, series costume designer Lou Eyrich found it challenging to select outfits which would be acceptable for a primetime series, yet would still appeal to all audiences. To appeal to younger viewers, Eyrich updated the costume worn by Colfer as Riff Raff, pairing a tailcoat with jeans and a J.Crew henley shirt. Michele's costuming as Janet was similar to her regular wardrobe as Rachel, with Eyrich commenting, [...] "That's why she was the perfect Janet." [...] Prior to broadcast, cast member Mark Salling claimed that he would play Rocky Horror talking lips. In the event, however, Salling did not appear in the episode. He was temporarily absent from the series, reportedly for creative reasons, and returned in November 2010. The <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> instead played by Rivera.|$|E

500|$|Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was {{slim and}} of average height. At {{the age of}} 17, he weighed only [...] (...) [...] He was {{described}} as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend [...] "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, constantly suffering from foul body odour; he was described as stinking [...] "to {{such a degree that}} he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He suffered from chronic diarrhoea, which was said to be [...] "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with [...] "a complete lack of force and ideas".|$|E
500|$|Barber's first attempt, modeled for {{the half}} dollar, disregarded Leech's instructions. Instead of a design based on French coinage, it {{depicted}} a standing figure of Columbia, bearing a pileus atop a liberty pole; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her. The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, enclosed inside a thick oak wreath, with the required legends surrounding the rim. Leech rejected the design, and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid-September {{with a head}} of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin. Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster; on September 28, he wrote Barber that Liberty's <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> [...] "rather voluptuous" [...] and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath. Barber did so, and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck. Barber complained, in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell, but intended for Leech, that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time. Leech replied, stating {{that he did not}} care how much effort was expended in order to improve the design, especially since, once issued, they would have to be used for 25 years. Barber's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with a cover letter from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb (Bosbyshell was traveling) stating that Barber [...] "disclaims any intention to be captious and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage". The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements, and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences; the overall tone was argumentative. Leech chose not to write again; he addressed one concern, about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately, by visiting the National Botanical Garden, obtaining one, and sending it to Barber.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guideline}} {{of silent}} prayer comes from Hannah's behavior during prayer, when she prayed in the Temple {{to bear a}} child. She prayed [...] "speaking upon her heart," [...] {{so that no one}} else could hear, yet her <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not loud enough for others to hear.|$|E
50|$|Lying <b>Lips</b> <b>is</b> a 1939 American melodrama race film by Oscar Micheaux, {{starring}} Edna Mae Harris, and Robert Earl Jones (the {{father of}} James Earl Jones). Lying <b>Lips</b> <b>was</b> the thirty-seventh film of Micheaux.|$|R

50|$|Chapped lips (also {{cheilitis}} simplex or common cheilitis) {{are characterized}} by cracking, fissuring, and peeling of {{the skin of the}} <b>lips,</b> and <b>are</b> {{one of the most common}} types of cheilitis. While both <b>lips</b> may <b>be</b> affected, the lower <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> the most common site.

2500|$|After Moore was {{released}} {{again from the}} University of Virginia Health System, he traveled {{to his home in}} Los Angeles, to start his rehabilitation program. On the morning of August 19, Moore was feeling unwell and those present could see that his <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> turning blue. [...] He was rushed to the hospital, but died shortly thereafter. While it was widely reported that he had died from a blood clot, the coroner's office determined his cause of death to be pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|In 1553, his daughter, Jeanne d'Albret, {{gave birth}} to Henry III of Navarre by singing a song of B√©arn to the Virgin Mary, so that the future Henry IV was [...] "neither fearful nor balked." [...] She had crossed into France to ensure her son would be born there. The baby's <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> {{moistened}} with the local Juran√ßon wine and rubbed with garlic shortly after birth. When Henry IV left Pau to become King of France, he remarked to local notables {{that he was not}} giving B√©arn to France, but giving France to B√©arn.|$|E
2500|$|Priapus is also {{mentioned}} in Vladimir Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading: [...] "Or when you, with eyes closed tight, devouring a spurting peach and then, having finished, but still swallowing, with your mouth still full, you cannibal, your glazed eyes wandered, your fingers were spread, your inflamed <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> all glossy, your chin trembled, all covered with drops of the cloudy juice, which trickled down onto your bared bosom, while the Priapus who had nourished you suddenly, with a convulsive oath, {{turned his back}} to me, who had entered {{the room at the}} wrong moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Make-up used by European fashion {{designers}} in the 1970s presented a sensual look {{for women in}} striking contrast to the [...] "natural look". Though models in Yves Saint Laurent's hugely influential runway shows wore menswear and short, slicked-back hair, their <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> glossy and bright red. YSL's cosmetics line also employed intense, feminine colors. In the violent, sexual porno chic fashion photography of French and Italian Vogue, women wore blood-red lipstick, glossy red nail polish, pencil-thin eyebrows and black eye make-up. Women employed this vision of beauty for evenings, when they could aim to seduce in the era's discos.|$|E
2500|$|The admiration between Revelli and Schembechler was mutual. [...] In a 1970 interview, Revelli {{compared}} {{himself and}} his training methods to those of Schembechler. [...] "Bo and I speak the same language. [...] Psychologically, our practices are the same. [...] Both the team and the band have to perfect their fundamentals before they can do anything else. [...] And both need proper warmups {{to stay in shape}} in the off-season. [...] Sometimes we'll spend 45 minutes on calisthenics of the embouchure (perfecting the position of the lips on the mouthpiece of an instrument). [...] I had one boy come back who hadn't practiced all summer. [...] His <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> about six months behind everyone else's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{problems}} were encountered during the conversion. The newly lengthened landing gear required more hydraulic fluid, which required a larger reservoir to hold it, a pump {{to move it}} quickly enough through the system, and so on through the hydraulic system. Retaining the relatively simple intakes but only {{on the bottom of}} the wing presented the issue that the airflow into the engine was from below, as opposed to the entire compressor face, so the ducts were extended above the wing to split the airflow evenly; this produced a noticeable bulge on the upper surface of the wing. No attempt was made to fit variable intakes. At high throttle settings, considerable suction into the inlets was generated; in the event of a sudden down-throttle motion by the pilot would result in air [...] "spilling" [...] out of the intakes, which was a concern because it could flow above the wing and disrupt the vortex. Small <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> added to the intakes to help prevent this, but this proved to cause intake buzzing. Changes to the ducts, assisted by Rolls-Royce, addressed this issue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lips</b> <b>are</b> soft, movable, {{and serve}} as the opening for food intake and in the {{articulation}} of sound and speech. Human <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell is}} thin, pellucid, fragile, white, {{slightly}} convolute, obliquely finely striate, left side slightly inflated. The aperture is large, open widely. The outer <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> disjoined from the apex, very slightly produced posteriorly and truncate. The inner <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> slightly callous.|$|R
5000|$|The outer <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> thin, not descending.

2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches on his <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E
