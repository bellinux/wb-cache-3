5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for <b>long</b> <b>because</b> they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity {{have been recorded}} to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for <b>long</b> <b>because</b> they may drown. They {{are believed to}} exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E

How harmful it must be, for the body to shed it so?One that drinks such harmful thing would not live long.But it is said; the bird that drinks tears would sing the most beautiful songs.The bird that drinks blood lives the <b>longest,</b> <b>because</b> he drinks what is so precious that nobody wants to give out.But because he stinks of blood no one goes near.|$|R

5|$|Finally, after brief resistance, Przemysł II {{was forced}} to give the {{strategic}} Lesser Polish land of Wieluń (also known as Ruda) {{in order to obtain}} his release, because Henry IV wanted a direct connection between Wrocław and Lesser Poland. The imprisonment of Przemysł II did not last too <b>long,</b> <b>because</b> on 3 March he was documented to have been in Poznań. Henry III and Henry V the Fat were both forced to grant much larger territorial concessions. In addition, the three Dukes agreed that upon the request of the Duke of Wrocław they would each give him military aid in the amount of thirty lancers. So this was, in practice, an act of homage.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as <b>long</b> <b>because</b> its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too <b>long</b> <b>because</b> they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have taken so <b>long</b> <b>because</b> Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° <b>long.</b> <b>Because</b> they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E

5|$|Von Helversen and Heller {{argued that}} none of the old names now {{considered}} synonyms of M.mystacinus could apply to M.alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of M.alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered. In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M.mystacinus from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus. The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so <b>long</b> <b>because</b> bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{developed}} his theology in his biblical commentaries {{as well as}} his sermons and treatises, but the most comprehensive expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries. The various editions of that work spanned nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as <b>long</b> <b>because</b> he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.|$|E

25|$|The toothless lower jaws of Gigantoraptor are fused into a broad shovel-like mandibula. They {{indicate}} that the unknown skull was over half a metre long and toothless also, probably equipped with a horny beak. The front tail vertebrae have very long neural spines and are heavily pneumaticised with deep pleurocoels. The middle section of the relatively short tail is somewhat stiffened by long prezygapophyses. The back tail vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone. The front limb is rather <b>long</b> <b>because</b> of an elongated slender hand. The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very rounded head. The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb. The hindlimb is also <b>long</b> <b>because</b> of an elongated lower leg. The thighbone is relatively slender and short with a distinct head and neck. The foot is robust with large and strongly curved toe claws.|$|E
