Benchmarking is most used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others. In 1994, one of the first technical journal named [...] "Benchmarking: An International Journal" [...] was published.|$|E
5000|$|Laser levels [...] {{project a}} beam which is visible and/or {{detectable}} by a sensor on the <b>leveling</b> <b>rod.</b> This style {{is widely used}} in construction work but not for more precise control work. An advantage is that one person can perform the levelling independently, whereas other types require one person at the instrument and one holding the rod.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} clearance of a bridge over a highway {{is important in}} preventing oversized vehicles from hitting the bridge. The {{vertical clearance}} of a bridge is traditionally measured by using surveying equipment such as <b>leveling</b> <b>rods</b> and total stations. Typically, measurements are taken at multiple locations {{in order to determine}} the minimum vertical clearance under the bridge. This process is time and labor consuming. Also, these measurements may not be accurate because of the traffic, the uneven surface, and the reading error caused by the surveyor. Additionally, when one is faced with a multitude of reports especially in large projects with multiple ramps and bridges, it is not easy and it often takes a long time to find the bridge under study. This research provides a highly accurate measurement of the vertical bridge clearance by using terrestrial laser scanners. The clearance can be measured in the office by processing the collected point cloud data. The minimum vertical clearance is easily identified and the measurement is visualized and geo-referenced. An approach to reduce data noise caused by traffic is also introduced in this study. In addition, to help reduce the confusion of finding the bridge under study and to facilitate access to the clearance data, the clearance measurements are geo-referenced to an online mapping system. This system allows access to the final deliverable very easily through a single web portal. Finally, Illinois Department of Transportation's Circle Interchange is used to demonstrate this new method...|$|R
40|$|Final thesis {{describes}} two {{variants of}} computational models to simulate cross-roll <b>leveling</b> of <b>rods,</b> {{which are based}} on the Lagrangian approach to describe the continuum. Implementation of both variants was performed in ANSYS software, and their main difference lies in the choice of the type of elements for the discretization. An integral part of this thesis is the description of the principle, which is an evaluation of the curvature of the rod after completion of the simulation leveling. In {{the other part of the}} work are presented the results, which are then compared with realized experiment and simulation algorithm for cross-roll leveling based on the Euler approach. The final part is dedicated to the optimal settings of the leveller...|$|R
5000|$|The {{spirit level}} is {{on a tripod}} with sight lines to the two points whose height {{difference}} is to be determined. A graduated <b>leveling</b> staff or <b>rod</b> is held vertical on each point; the rod may be graduated in centimetres and fractions or tenths and hundredths of a foot. The observer focuses in turn on each rod and reads the value. Subtracting the [...] "back" [...] and [...] "forward" [...] value provides the height difference. If the instrument is placed equidistant from the two points to be measured, any small errors in its adjustment {{and the effects of}} earth curvature and refraction will tend to cancel out.|$|R
5000|$|When optical {{leveling}} is done, {{the path}} corresponds closely to following {{a value of}} dynamic height horizontally, but to orthometric height for vertical changes measured on the <b>leveling</b> <b>rod.</b> Thus small corrections must be applied to field measurements to obtain either the dynamic height or the orthometric height usually used in engineering. US National Geodetic Survey data sheets [...] give both dynamic and orthometric values.|$|E
50|$|Invar is used where high {{dimensional}} stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, television shadow-mask frames, valves in engines, and antimagnetic watches. In land surveying, when first-order (high-precision) elevation leveling {{is to be}} performed, the level staff (<b>leveling</b> <b>rod)</b> used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals. Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} two years Tutweiler earned his {{living as a}} teacher. He then began work as an engineer, taking a position as a rodman (a surveyor's assistant who holds the <b>leveling</b> <b>rod)</b> in the engineering corps of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad. He was an indefatigable worker and made rapid advance in his profession during the next ten or twelve years. He served in various capacities, from locating engineer to chief engineer, {{in connection with the}} Chesapeake and Ohio, the Cincinnati Southern, the Miami Valley, the Richmond and Allegheny, and finally with the Georgia Pacific Railway. Tutwiler had the distinction of locating the eastern end of the Chesapeake and Ohio from Richmond to Newport News during the early 1870s. In 1879 he served one year as assistant engineer of the City of Cincinnati.|$|E
40|$|Current {{requirements}} {{in mechanical engineering}} require more accurate operations and more efficient technologies. The aim of this thesis is {{the analysis of the}} <b>leveling</b> of square <b>rods.</b> The main problem is the setting of the leveling machine for the specified material and geometric data so that the initially curved material, which passes through alternatively positioned offset rollers, is leveled as much as possible. The main factor in the leveling process is the plastification of the material used for the redistribution of the residual stress. Based on existing theo-retical knowledge in this field, programs are set up to simulate the passing of the <b>rod</b> through the <b>leveling</b> machine. Further, modifications leading to the improvement of the whole process are presented. Finally, there is a verification of the results which is made independently of the submitted solution and processed by the finite element method...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} the stripe precision of a <b>leveling</b> <b>rod,</b> an automatic laser interferometer and a vision measurement system {{were designed by}} Xi’an University of Technology in China. The rod was driven by a closed-loop control and {{the data were collected}} at the stop state to ensure precision. The laser interferometer provided not only the long distance data but also a position feedback signal in the automatic control loop. CCD camera and a vision measurement method were used to inspect the stripe edge position and defect. A pixel-equivalent self-calibration method was designed to improve precision. ROI (regions of interest) method and an outline tracing method were designed to quickly extract multiple stripe edges. A combination of the image data with the interferometer data reduces control difficulty and ensures the measurement accuracy. The vision measurement method reached sub-pixel precision and the defective edges were reported. The system can automatically calibrate a stripe <b>leveling</b> <b>rod</b> {{with a high degree of}} efficiency and precision...|$|E
30|$|We also {{considered}} the scale error, {{which is considered}} to be the main factor involved in systematic errors from leveling surveys. A significant cause of such errors is the shift in scale due to thermal expansion of the <b>leveling</b> <b>rod.</b> However, in our survey, we used spear invar rods to minimize thermal expansion. In addition, we made a correction for thermal expansion using the linear expansion coefficient of spear invar. We also took temperature measurements {{at the time of the}} leveling surveys in order to estimate the correction value. We additionally checked the influence using a case where the linear expansion coefficient had an uncertainty of 5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 7 /°C, where the temperature difference was 10  °C and where the maximum relative height from benchmark BM 34 was approximately 350  m. A scale error of only 1.75  mm was estimated, and this value was considered sufficiently small as to not significantly affect the results. Therefore, we concluded that the results were accurate enough to detect a deformation of greater than a few millimeters.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} analyze double meridian distance for a closed traverse area {{in developing a}} land title for a propose gymnasium in Qassim University. Theodolite, <b>leveling</b> <b>rod</b> and steel tape {{plays an important role}} in measuring elevations, bearings and distances of the boundaries of a lot. Contour map is necessary to determine the traces of level surfaces of successive elevation. This will enable to identify the type of contour map and type of contour lines necessary for this project. Corel draw software is used to draw contour map and guide to interpret the significance of the variables. It is essential to check the error of closure for interior angles and for both latitude and departure before applying the Double Meridian Distance (DMD) method to obtain the total area of the lot. Technical descriptions of the land such as distance, bearing, boundaries and area are necessary to visualize the shape & exact location of the land. Developing a land title will be obtained using the technical descriptions of the lot in preparation for the type of gymnasium necessary for Qassim University...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, to {{optimize}} the “Characteristic Straight Line Method ” which {{is used in the}} soil displacement analysis, a “best estimate ” of the geodetic leveling observations has been achieved by taking in account the concept of ‘Height systems”. This concept has been discussed in detail and consequently the concept of “height”. In landslides dynamic analysis, the soil is considered as a mosaic of rigid blocks. The soil displacement has been monitored and analyzed by using the “Characteristic Straight Line Method”. Its characteristic components have been defined constructed from a “best estimate ” of the topometric observations. In the measurement of elevation differences, we have used the most modern leveling equipment available. Observational procedures have also been designed to provide the most effective method to acquire data. In addition systematic errors which cannot be sufficiently controlled by instrumentation or observational techniques are minimized by applying appropriate corrections to the observed data: the level collimation correction minimizes the error caused by nonhorizontality of the leveling instrument's line of sight for unequal sight lengths, the refraction correction is modeled to minimize the refraction error caused by temperature (density) variation of air strata, the rod temperature correction accounts for variation in the length of the <b>leveling</b> <b>rod</b> ' s Invar/LO-VAR ® strip which results from temperature changes, the rod scale correction ensures a uniform scale which conforms to the international length standard and the introduction of the concept of the ‘Height systems ” where all types of height (orthometric, dynamic, normal, gravity correction, and equipotential surface) have been investigated. The “Characteristic Straight Line Method ” is slightly more convenient than the “Characteristic Circle Method”. It permits to evaluate a displacement of very small magnitude even when the displacement is of an infinitesimal quantity. The inclination of the landslide is given by the inverse of the distance reference point O to the “Characteristic Straight Line”. Its direction is given by the bearing of the normal directed from point...|$|E
