50|$|In recent years, polymer-dispersed liquid {{crystals}} (PDLCs) {{have been}} used in many applications including smart windows, displays, microlenses, lasers, and data storage, due to their excellent electro-optical properties. Within a PDLC film, liquid crystals (LCs) are generally trapped in a transparent polymer medium, thus forming micrometer-scale LC droplets. The PDLC film can be switched from opaque to transparent by acoustic tweezers. A SAW-driven PDLC <b>light</b> <b>shutter</b> has been demonstrated by integrating a cured PDLC film and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) onto a piezoelectric substrate. The IDTs were used to generate the SAW for driving the PDLC film. Figure 19 illustrates the layout and working principle of the SAW-driven PDLC <b>light</b> <b>shutter.</b> A PDLC cell is located in between two identical IDTs, which are deposited on a piezoelectric substrate with a parallel arrangement. One IDT is used for SAW generation and the other is used for SAW detection. A radio-frequency (RF) signal is applied to a single IDT to generate a SAW, which propagates along the surface of the piezoelectric substrate (x direction in Figure 19). By tuning the applied frequencies from the function generator and monitoring the frequency-dependent output voltage from the detection IDT that is connected to an oscilloscope, an optimal resonant frequency can be selected for the driving frequency. Under this resonance frequency, the LC molecules can be reoriented perpendicular to the substrate. Therefore, the optical properties of PDLC film can be changed with acoustic tweezers.|$|E

Homogeneous alignment of the NLC was obtained by rubbing the surfaces of the substrates having the molecular aligning film of poly (vinyl alcohol). Two types of cells were prepared: the single cells and the stacked cells with double- and triple-layers. The cells were driven by an AC signal voltage utilizing the transient nematic effect which was proposed by Perregaux and Wu et al. The wavelength of the incident light was 653 nm. The performance of the cells were evaluated by using the parameters: the response time, the contrast ratio (CR), and the steepness of the optical transmission curve (M). The response time of the stacked sells was about 0. 1 ms. For the response time and M, the stacked cells were better than the single cells.
