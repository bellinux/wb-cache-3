In 2003, shortly {{after graduating from}} high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career. He adopted his stage name from the {{nickname}} his father gave him, adding [...] "Mars" [...] at the end because: [...] "I felt like I didn't have [...] pizzazz, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> say I’m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars." [...] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also due to [...] "the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latino artist, and even convinced him to sing in Spanish." ...|$|E

[...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls.</b> They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers."

Her role was {{reportedly}} described as [...] "a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature." [...] Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki ever since seeing her in Dev D and That Girl in Yellow Boots. She felt that Kalki would fit the bill for the character of Natasha, since she had [...] "the sense of comedy, but not over the top." [...] Ariadna was chosen for {{the role of}} Nuria, since she was liked for her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloise. The full cast of the film was confirmed by April 2010.|$|E

500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character.

During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E

She reflected back on the character during a 2010 interview, saying [...] "I feel like there's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> out there who could really relate to her, who hadn't seen themselves on TV in that way. I loved that about her. I loved that she made no apologies for who she was even though she wasn't what all the magazines said was OK. She was like, [...] "I'm still valid. And I'm awesome.

2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date for a moment to go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said that that is not something he does: If I want to get in touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> might be trying to find me on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{and critics}} have differing views {{on whether the}} film {{represents}} feminist issues. Historically, among the [...] "top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350million and up), not one has been built around a female action star". Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of [...] "archetypal figures {{in the literature of}} the American West" [...] such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both [...] "masculine" [...] and [...] "feminine" [...] traits equally. Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: [...] "Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful—and, I suspect, what makes her so important to a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> and women—is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story." [...] Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of [...] "athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting" [...] are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless. Mahvesh Murad of The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is [...] "a young female protagonist with agency", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{presented}} [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] {{in a short}} {{live acoustic}} performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it {{hard for her to}} perform it live, saying [...] "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." [...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|E
