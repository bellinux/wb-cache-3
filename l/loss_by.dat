5|$|After the Florida loss, Alabama's senior {{starting}} quarterback, John David Phillips, {{was replaced}} by freshman Andrew Zow. With Zow as the new starter, Alabama proceeded to win its next two games: 2017 against Ole Miss and 2322 against East Carolina. On October 24, Zow endured his first loss as the team's starting quarterback when Alabama was defeated, 3518, by eventual SEC (and national) champion Tennessee. Alabama rebounded from the <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> reeling off two more wins: 3020 against Southern Miss and an upset 2216 win over LSU, in which the Crimson Tide scored 15 points in 144 seconds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's 2006 {{season began}} with a tough game against No. 2 Notre Dame. Though the Yellow Jackets lost 14-10, they took an early 10-0 lead over heavily favored Notre Dame until the Fighting Irish scored 14 {{unanswered}} points to win the game. Tech bounced back from the narrow <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> winning five straight games, including a 38-27 victory in Blacksburg, Virginia against the No. 11 Virginia Tech Hokies, who would later go on to finish second in the division.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} seventh {{game of the}} season, Georgia Tech was 5-1 and had an undefeated 3-0 record in conference play. At No. 12 Clemson, however, Tech {{suffered}} its first conference loss and largest loss of the season, losing 31-7. Tech wide receiver Calvin Johnson failed to record a reception {{for the first time}} in his career during the loss. Tech followed the <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> winning its next four games. Following the third win, a 7-0 shutout of North Carolina, Tech clinched the Coastal Division championship and a bid to the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|In Neuer's debut for Newark, {{he allowed}} nine walks, eight runs, and made two errors; his {{pitching}} was noted as the direct {{cause of the}} 8–5 <b>loss.</b> <b>By</b> the beginning of June, Newark returned him to New York; in his short time in the Eastern League, Neuer set the record for most strikeouts in a game and most walks in a game, with 13 each. Griffith sent him back to Newark almost immediately, and they in turn {{sent him to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, who in turn released him. He then signed with the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and pitched for them before being released on August 1.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process {{that should not be}} counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{opened the}} regular season on April18 with a four-game series on the road versus the Louisville Colonels, and Stivetts started games two and four. In game two, he {{recorded}} 13strikeouts, but lost the game 5–3 on a tenth-inning, two run double by Tim Shinnick. In game four on April21, Stivetts was again credited with the <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> allowing 17runs to score, seven of which were earned. He fared better in his third start however, allowing just one run as the Browns defeated the Solons by a 14–1score. He struck out 12batters, including the first seven he faced, and hit the first home run of his career.|$|E
5|$|The bad omens of {{the preseason}} were {{discarded}} in the Seminoles' {{first two games}} of the season: a 5513 win against Duke and a 297 victory over Alabama-Birmingham.

Florida State recovered from the <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> beating Wake Forest, 4824, but lost to No. 2 Miami in the following week, 4927.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{supernova}} discovery steadily increased {{throughout the}} twentieth century. In the 1990s, several automated supernova search programs were initiated. The Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search program was begun in 1992 at Leuschner Observatory. It was joined {{the same year}} by the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope program. These were succeeded in 1996 by the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory, which was primarily used for the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (<b>LOSS).</b> <b>By</b> 2000, the Lick program resulted in the discovery of 96 supernovae, making it the world's most successful Supernova search program.|$|E

5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26-yard line, {{where the}} Tigers began their second {{offensive}} possession. It began {{no better than}} the first, as Dantzler was tackled for a three-yard <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> defensive tackle Lamar Cobb. A rush for no gain and a short pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down. Somaini's second punt was kicked cleanly, and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42-yard line. Two rushes and a pass to the 50-yard line were not enough for a first down, and Tech punted to the Clemson 17-yard line.|$|E

5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, Kitchener {{ordered a}} flying column, led by Major-General Sir Archibald Hunter and {{composed}} of around three-thousand Egyptian soldiers, to march from Merowe to Abu Hamed with all possible speed. The flying column departed Merawi on 29 July 1897, and, marching north-east along the Nile for eight days, {{arrived at the}} town as dawn broke on August 7. Forming his battalions in a broad semi-circle that pitted Abu Hamed’s defenders against the river, Major-General Hunter ordered his troops to advance at approximately six-thirty that morning. In the action that followed, the outnumbered Mahdist riflemen were driven from their defensive positions through the town, while a small contingent of Mahdist cavalry fled south without engaging to report the <b>loss.</b> <b>By</b> seven-thirty, the battle was over, and Major-General Hunter ordered the news be delivered to Lord Kitchener.|$|E
