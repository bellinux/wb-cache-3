5|$|Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado.

His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.|$|E
5|$|Stan is an {{elementary}} school student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado.

5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Ceolnoth (died 870) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of Canterbury. Although later chroniclers stated he had {{previously}} held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury, there is no contemporary evidence of this, and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833. Ceolnoth faced two problems as archbishop– raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during {{the early part of}} his archiepiscopate. Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838. Ceolnoth's later years in office were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted {{in the back of her}} neck. Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox.|$|E

5|$|Fisher {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to serve as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921, but Hughes did not permit it. Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more, {{but he was not}} interested in doing so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, for the remainder of his <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Good is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American rapper Nas. It was recorded at various studios in New York and California, and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi. Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and {{compared it to}} Marvin Gaye's 1978 record Here, My Dear. He wanted to vent personal feelings and address moments in his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> songs, while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is happening to her husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, in Munich, Germany, Edward {{researches}} rocketry {{with his}} friend Alfons Heiderich, {{a young man who}} resembles Alphonse, in the hopes of returning to his world. Edward rescues a troubled, persecuted Romani woman named Noah from being sold. Noah is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons, and begins having visions concerning Edward's <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> world. The next day, Edward meets Fritz Lang, a Jewish film director resembling King Bradley, who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has been seeking for inspiration for his next film. The dragon, which turns out to be homunculus Envy, attacks Edward, but is then weakened and captured by members of the Thule Society.|$|E
5|$|Washington had {{established}} his preeminence {{among the new}} nation's Founding Fathers through his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and {{as president of the}} 1787 Constitutional Convention. Once the Constitution was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first President of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first inaugural address expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but Washington proved an able leader.|$|E
5|$|Bede also covers Wilfrid's <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, {{but this}} account is more {{measured}} and restrained than the Vita. In the Historia, Bede used Stephen's Vita as a source, reworking {{the information and}} adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid's life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede's letters. A poetical Vita Sancti Wilfrithi by Frithegod written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen's Vita, produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid's relics to Canterbury. Wilfrid is also mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but as the Chronicle was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen's Vita or from Bede. Another, later, source is the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi written by Eadmer, a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is highly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt to provide some new material besides reworking Bede.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state {{in a matter of months}} after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E
5|$|Following their conquest in 1211–1212, {{the cities}} were granted as a fief to Otto de la Roche, Duke of Athens, by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. The lordship {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the de la Roche and the Brienne Dukes of Athens even after the conquest of the Duchy of Athens by the Catalan Company in 1311, and the Brienne line continued to be recognized as Dukes of Athens there. Walter II of Brienne was largely an absentee lord, spending most of his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> European domains, except for a failed attempt in 1331 to recover Athens from the Catalans. After his death in 1356 the lordship was inherited by his sixth son, Guy of Enghien. Guy took up residence in Greece, and in 1370–1371 Guy and his brothers launched another, also failed, invasion of the Catalan domains. When Guy died in 1376, the lordship then passed to his daughter Maria of Enghien and her Venetian husband Pietro Cornaro, who would also reside there until his death in 1388. The lordship became a de facto Venetian dependency during this period, and shortly after his death, Marie sold the two cities to Venice, where she retired. Before Venice could take possession, Argos was seized by the Despot Theodore I Palaiologos, while his ally, Nerio I Acciaioli seized Nauplia. The latter city was soon captured by Venice, but Argos remained in Byzantine hands until 1394, when it too was handed over to Venice.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, Blaine {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only eighteen years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two were married. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine’s family in Augusta, Maine for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851. The young family soon moved again, this time to Philadelphia where Blaine took a job at the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind (now Overbrook School for the Blind) in 1852, teaching science and literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Kippenberger {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45. The New Zealand government had made initial plans for a published record of New Zealand's involvement in the war as early as 1943. Kippenberger, well respected across all branches of New Zealand's services, was championed by New Zealand's prime minister, Peter Fraser, as the person to coordinate the project. The resulting series of books, covering campaign and unit histories as well as volumes on the New Zealand people at war, was {{to be published by}} the War History Branch at the Department of Internal Affairs. By 1946, his work with the Reception Group was largely complete and he returned to New Zealand to take up his new position.
