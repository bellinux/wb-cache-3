Memory Channel enforces sequential consistency across the interconnect, while SCI allows store reordering. This gives SCI a potential performance payoff by allowing more flexible pipelining of data through the interconnect. The lower number of ordering constraints also reduces hardware complexity, but moves the complexity to software. For a straightforward implementation of message passing this overhead is significant. A new software algorithm, the valid flag algorithm, is introduced to improve this situation. A new hardware <b>lock</b> <b>support</b> mechanism is proposed to facilitate efficient locks in absence of <b>lock</b> <b>support</b> on the I/O bus. Performance of the simple message passing protocol is compared to the suggested valid flag protocol. The valid flag protocol reduces latency of a small message by 50 [...] ...|$|E

These targets vary widely in their capabilities, and in some cases additional effort is needed within ROMIO to support all MPI-IO semantics. Two aspects of the interface that can be problematic to implement are MPI-IO atomic mode and the shared file pointer access routines. Atomic mode requires enforcing strict consistency semantics, and shared file pointer routines require communication and coordination in order to atomically update a shared resource. For some file systems, native locks may be used to implement these features, but not all file systems have <b>lock</b> <b>support.</b> In this work, we describe algorithms for implementing efficient mutex lock...|$|E

40|$|The ROMIO {{implementation}} of the MPI-IO standard provides a portable infrastructure for use on top of any number of different underlying storage targets. These dif-ferent targets vary widely in their capabilities, and in some cases, additional effort is needed within ROMIO to support the complete MPI-IO semantics. One aspect of the interface that can be problematic to implement is the MPI-IO atomic mode. This mode requires enforcing strict consistency se-mantics. For some file systems, native locks {{may be used to}} enforce these semantics, but not all file systems have <b>lock</b> <b>support.</b> In this work, we describe two algorithms for imple-menting efficient mutex locks using MPI- 1 and MPI- 2 capa-bilities. We then show how these algorithms may be used to implement a portable MPI-IO atomic mode for ROMIO. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms and show that they impose little additional overhead on the system. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This report {{sets out}} to put the finger on and {{contrast}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of two different technologies of database management, relational database management systems (RDBMS) vs. object-oriented database management systems (ODBMS). The ODBMS is the youngest of the two and has had great success in challenging the overwhelming dominance of RDBMS in many areas concerned with complex data, e. g. computer aided design, software engineering, multi-media etc. The virtue of ODBMSs is their ability to provide a persistent storage for all kinds of objects. These objects can be created in most of the popular object oriented programming languages and can then be stored and manipulated in a safe manner in an ODBMS. The areas, or parts of areas, where RDBMSs are the stronger are concerning solidity of data model foundation, experience, set standards, query optimization, concurrency control <b>locks,</b> <b>support</b> for views, support for security, suitability for on-line transaction processing. Both types of DBMSs are continuously extending their capabilities towards a common goal using different techniques. Whether one will become the sole dominant or if the two will have their own niches of the market is too early to say. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Energetic {{efficiency}} and stability are the fundamental criteria which {{can improve the}} autonomy and task performance capabilities of humanoid robots. The scope {{of this paper is}} to investigate the energetic effects of knee locking and addition of torsional springs to different joints of a sevenlink fully actuated planar bipedal robot. The focus is on the reduction of energy consumption during walking. The energetic cost of walking is determined without joint stiffness and knee locking as a baseline for the comparison of results. In the first approach, the gait trajectory is optimized by adding springs to different joints and energetic cost of walk is then calculated at different walking speeds. The second approach presented in this paper is to mechanically <b>lock</b> the <b>support</b> knee and then optimize the gait and calculate the walking cost. The energetic cost of walking determined for the above two cases is then compared to the baseline cost. It is observed that addition of torsional springs at both hips reduce the walking cost up to 50 %, support hip up to 85 % with spring stiffness as an optimization variable for both cases while mechanically <b>locking</b> the <b>support</b> knee reduces the cost of walking up to 25 % with gait and knee locking angle optimized.
