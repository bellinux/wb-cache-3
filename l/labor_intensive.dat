2500|$|Xenon short-arc lamps {{were invented}} in the 1940s in Germany and {{introduced}} in 1951 by Osram. First {{produced in the}} 2 kW size (XBO2001), these lamps saw wide use in movie projection, where they replaced the older, more <b>labor</b> <b>intensive</b> (to operate) carbon arc lamps. The white continuous light generated by the xenon arc is spectrally similar to daylight, but the lamp has a rather low efficacy in terms of lumens of visible light output per watt of input power. Today, almost all movie projectors in theaters employ these lamps, with power ratings ranging from 900 watts up to 12kW. Omnimax (Imax Dome) projection systems use single xenon lamps with ratings as high as 15kW. [...] As of 2016, laser illumination for digital theater projectors is starting to establish a market presence and has been predicted will supersede the xenon arc lamp for this application.|$|E
2500|$|While {{members of}} the LDS Church {{consider}} vicarious ordinances for the deceased a great service, some non-members have taken offense. Sensitive {{to the issue of}} proxy baptizing for non-Mormons not related to church members, the church in recent years has published a general policy of performing temple ordinances only for relatives. [...] For example, the church {{is in the process of}} removing sensitive names (such as Jewish Holocaust victims) from its International Genealogical Index (IGI). D. Todd Christofferson of the church's Presidency of the Seventy stated that removing the names is an [...] "ongoing, <b>labor</b> <b>intensive</b> process requiring name-by-name research .... When the Church is made aware of documented concerns, action is taken .... Plans are underway to refine this process." [...] The LDS Church keeps records of the temple ordinances performed for deceased persons; however, FamilySearch, a web application for accessing the church's genealogical databases, shows information on temple ordinances only to registered LDS Church members and not to non-members.|$|E

40|$|Using U. S. {{real-time}} data, we {{show that}} changes in the unemployment rate unexplained by Okun’s Law have significant predictive power for GDP data revisions. A positive (negative) error in Okun’s Law in real time implies that GDP will be later revised to show less (more) growth than initially estimated by the statistical agency. The information in Okun’s Law errors about the true state of real economic activity also helps to improve GDP forecasts in the near term. Our findings add {{a new dimension to}} the interpretation of real-time Okun’s Law errors, as they show that these errors can convey information other than a change in potential GDP, the equilibrium unemployment rate, or the use of <b>labor’s</b> <b>intensive</b> margin.

40|$|Includes BibliographyThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} the intensity of international trade flows and labor productivity for 28 industries in the five main economies in the region (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) using the Arellano-Bond generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The results show that international trade flows contributed through various channels to labor productivity growth in the period 1990 to 2008. These channels, which have been developed in the theoretical literature, are export intensity (share of production exported), import penetration (share of domestic demand covered by imports), the diversification of the export basket and intra-industry trade. The estimation also includes several control variables, of which several turn out significant. In addition to estimates for the total manufacturing sector, we also show results for three different groups of manufacturing industries characterized by different factor endowments: natural resource <b>intensive,</b> <b>labor</b> and capital <b>intensive</b> ones...|$|R
50|$|Gambling {{provides}} {{jobs since}} all commercial games require <b>labor.</b> Casinos require <b>intensive</b> <b>labor</b> including security guards, technical support staff, gaming staff, among others. In 1996, around 300,000 employees earned {{a total of}} US$7.7 billion within the US nation. This number does not include those who are indirectly involved with gambling, such as racing organizers. Employment resulting from gambling is difficult to estimate since gambling involves employees in many different stages. Entertainment is interlinked with gambling as well. Take for instance, the many shows available in casinos in Las Vegas. Hotel services and chauffeurs are also in higher demand because of gambling. As this shows, gambling increases aggregate demand {{for goods and services}} in the economy. In 1996, Americans spent 1 out of every US$10 on commercial gambling games. This money goes directly toward stimulating the economy. This expenditure on gambling can also be magnified when considering the multiplier effect.|$|R

We find that the aggregate labor supply elasticity to a transitory wage shock is 1. 27, with the extensive margin accounting for 54 % of the response. Furthermore, we also simulate the 1987 tax holiday in Iceland - a quasi-natural experiment - and find that the aggregate labor supply responses in the model are similar to those actually observed in Iceland.

40|$|Monascus {{fermentation}} products (MFPs) {{have been}} widely used by people mainly in Asian countries for many centuries as food colorant, preservative, food supplement and traditional medicine. With the cultivation of different strains of Monascus and fermentation in various substrates, MFPs are now widely available and are becoming popular worldwide. This review mainly introduces recent advances in research, technological development, production and application of Monascus. In recent years, the Monascus industry have progressed from the traditional, <b>labored</b> <b>intensive</b> and time consuming approach to more efficient production of Monascus products that allows the industry to overcome problems of space, scale-up and process control. Many studies on the molecular biology of Monascus are progressing gradually, providing us with more information and knowledge to enable us to explore the Monascus for designing novel functional foods as well as industrial applications. The production of natural Monascus dyes provides a platform for further improvement or related products, among which Monascus red pigments is the most promising product while Monascus yellow pigment has also gained a rapid development recently. To find a functional MFPs and an economic alternative to produce MFPs, research groups, mainly in Asia, develop non-rice MFPs i. e. Monascus-fermented soybean (MFS), Monascus-fermented adlay (MFA), Monascus-fermented dioscorea (MFD) and other new MFPs such as Monascus-fermented garlic, Monascus-fermented ginseng and Monascus-fermented durian seed. The physiological active components of functional Monascus products such as lovastatin and polysaccharides have become {{an important part of the}} Monascus industry. The “esterifying Monascus products” has been applied as a new biocatalyst which can be widely used in the Chinese spirits and soy sauce brewing. As with any industry, the safety and regulations on MFPs are also important to ensure its applications in foods and medicine are well accepted by the public...|$|R
