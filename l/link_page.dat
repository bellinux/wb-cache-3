40|$|When making {{decisions}} about whether to navigate to a <b>linked</b> <b>page,</b> users of standard browsers of hypertextual documents returned by an information retrieval search engine are entirely reliant {{on the content of}} the anchortext associated with links and the surrounding text.

We describe a prototype focusing browsing application which provides feedback on the likely usefulness of each <b>page</b> <b>linked</b> from the current one, and a term cloud preview of the contents of each <b>linked</b> <b>page.</b> Results from an exploratory experiment suggest that users can ﬁnd this useful in improving their search efﬁciency...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} Web Impact Factors (WIFs) for Iranian {{universities}} and introduces {{a new system}} of measurement. Counts of links to the web sites of Iranian universities were calculated from the output of AltaVista search engine. The WIFs for Iranian universities were calculated by dividing <b>link</b> <b>page</b> counts by the number of pages found in AltaVista for each university at a given point in time. These WIFs were then compared, to study the impact, visibility, and influence of Iranian university web sites. Overall, Iranian university web sites have a low inlink WIF. While specific features of sites may affect an institution's Web Impact Factor, there is a significant correlation between the proportion of English-language pages at an institution's site and the institution's backlink counts. This indicates that for linguistic reasons, Iranian (Persian-language) web sites may not attract the attention they deserve from the World Wide Web. This raises the possibility that information may be ignored due to linguistic and geographic barriers, and this should be taken into account {{in the development of the}} global Web...|$|E

40|$|Social {{bookmarking}} is {{a recent}} phenomenon which {{has the potential to}} give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del. icio. us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del. icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward <b>link</b> <b>page</b> text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} from the received item to the searchable data structure is called Indexing. Indexing (originally called Cataloging) [11] {{is the oldest}} technique for identifying the contents of items to assist in their retrieval. The basic difference between the existing methods and the one discussed here is that these methods rely on a structure of web page linkages that lead from or to the indexed page. In contrast, our method uses {{the content of the}} <b>pages</b> <b>linked</b> to or from the indexed page for indexing. So, our method uses a structure of words used by the <b>linked</b> <b>pages,</b> whereas the current methods use the structure of the connections between <b>linked</b> <b>pages...</b>|$|R

We already know that in social media-sharing websites, list pages have outlinks to detail pages and profile pages, and we name such <b>links</b> detail <b>page</b> <b>links</b> and profile <b>page</b> <b>links,</b> respectively. It is usually easy to differentiate them because in the DOM tree structure, detail <b>page</b> <b>links</b> generally have image thumbnails as their children, while profile <b>page</b> <b>links</b> have text nodes, which are usually the uploader names, as their children. Combined with our path string method, we can efficiently identify such outlinks.

Since we are not following profile <b>page</b> <b>links,</b> the classification result for page [...]...|$|R
