Both factors are essential quantities for the accurate prediction of the flux distribution within the machine and of the machine torque. Therefore, they are desired for the purpose of machine design and optimization. In order to evaluate the validity of the proposed models, the Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is used. The results show that the errors between the FEM results and analytical predictions are less than 1 % for both the airgap and zigzag <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes.</b> This accuracy is also proven by the prototype measurements...|$|R

40|$|In static {{environmental}} chamber experiments, {{the precision of}} gas flux measurements can be significantly improved by a thorough gas leakage correction to avoid underor overestimation of biological activity such as respiration or photosynthesis. Especially {{in the case of}} small biological net gas exchange rates or gas accumulation phases during long environmental monitoring experiments, gas <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes</b> could distort the analysis of the biogenic gas kinetics. Here we propose and demonstrate a general protocol for online correction of diffusion-driven gas leakage in plant chambers by simultaneous quantification of the inert tracer sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) and the investigated biogenic gases using enhanced Raman spectroscopy. By quantifying the leakage rates of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and hydrogen (H 2) simultaneously with SF 6 in the test chamber, their effective diffusivity ratios of approximately 1. 60, 1. 96, and 5. 65 were determined, each related to SF 6. Because our experiments suggest that the effective diffusivity ratios are reproducible for an individual static {{environmental chamber}}, even under varying concentration gradients and slight changes of the chamber sealing, an experimental method to quantify gas <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes</b> by using effective diffusivity ratios and SF 6 <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes</b> is proposed. The method is demonstrated by quantifying the CO 2 net exchange rate of a plant−soil ecosystem (Mirabilis jalapa).

50|$|The ideal {{transformer}} model assumes that all flux {{generated by the}} primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings. Such flux is termed <b>leakage</b> <b>flux,</b> and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings. <b>Leakage</b> <b>flux</b> results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.

This reduces the field, because much of the magnetic field path is in air rather than the higher permeability core material. A higher magnetic field and inductance can be achieved by forming the core in a closed magnetic circuit. The magnetic field lines form closed loops within the core without leaving the core material. The shape often used is a toroidal or doughnut-shaped ferrite core. Because of their symmetry, toroidal cores allow a minimum of the magnetic flux to escape outside the core (called <b>leakage</b> <b>flux),</b> so they radiate less electromagnetic interference than other shapes.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{sub-domain}} perturbation technique for refining magnetic circuit models with finite element (FE) models of different dimensions. Design/methodology/approach – A simplified problem considering ideal flux tubes is first solved, as either a 1 D magnetic circuit or a simplified FE problem. Its solution is then corrected via FE perturbation problems considering the actual flux tube geometry and the exterior regions, that allow first 2 D and then 3 D <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Each of these sub-problems requires an appropriate proper volume mesh, with no need of interconnection. The solutions are transferred from one problem to the other through projections of source fields between meshes. Findings: The developed perturbation FE method allows to split magnetic circuit analyses into subproblems of lower complexity with regard to meshing operations and computational aspects. A natural progression from simple to more elaborate models, from 1 D to 3 D geometries, is thus possible, while quantifying the gain given by each model refinement and justifying its utility. Originality/value: Approximate problems with ideal flux tubes are accurately corrected when accounting for <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes</b> via surface sources of perturbations. The constraints involved in the subproblems are carefully defined in the resulting FE formulations, respecting their inherent strong and weak nature. As a result, an efficient and accurate computation of local fields and global quantities, i. e. flux, MMF, reluctance, is obtained. The method is naturally adapted to parameterized analyses on geometrical and material data. status: publishe...|$|R
