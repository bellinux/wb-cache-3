One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline over them, and then burn them alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the <b>liberating</b> forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E

While there was initial jubilation amongst the people of Hungary, they soon found that they had only {{exchanged}} one totalitarian regime for another.

5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, <b>liberating</b> sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, <b>liberating</b> sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E

5000|$|The {{photoelectric}} {{work function}} is the minimum photon energy required to <b>liberate</b> an electron from a substance, in the photoelectric effect.If the photon's energy {{is greater than}} the substance's work function, photoelectric emission occurs and the electron is <b>liberated</b> from the surface.Similar to the thermionic case described above, the <b>liberated</b> electrons can be extracted into a collector and produce a detectable current, if an electric field is applied into the surface of the emitter.Excess photon energy results in a <b>liberated</b> electron with non-zero kinetic energy.It is expected that the minimum photon energy [...] required to <b>liberate</b> an electron (and generate a current) is where We is the work function of the emitter.|$|R
5|$|Sea anemones breed by <b>liberating</b> {{sperm and}} eggs through the mouth into the sea.

Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild.|$|E
