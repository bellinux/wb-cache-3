25|$|An {{important}} logical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked {{is the principle}} of <b>least</b> <b>privilege.</b> The principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege</b> requires that an individual, program or system process is not granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task. A blatant example of the failure {{to adhere to the}} principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege</b> is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, or they are promoted to a new position, or they transfer to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Windows Store, Microsoft encouraged third parties to use Windows Installer {{as the basis for}} installation frameworks, so that they synchronize correctly with other installers and keep the internal database of installed products consistent. Important features such as rollback and versioning depend on a consistent internal database for reliable operation. Furthermore, Windows Installer facilitates the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege</b> by performing software installations by proxy for unprivileged users.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of a {{vulnerability}} or misconfiguration allowing privilege escalation, many programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege separation, privilege revocation and chrooting. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege,</b> where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege. Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the file system, prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of many common applications, such as tcpdump, file, tmux, smtpd, and syslogd.|$|E
40|$|The widely popular browser {{extensions}} {{now become}} one of the most commonly used malware attack vectors. The Google Chrome browser, which implements the principles of <b>least</b> <b>privileges</b> and privilege separation by design, offers a strong security mechanism to protect malicious websites from damaging the whole browser system via extensions. In this study, we however reveal that Chrome’s extension security model is not a panacea for all possible attacks with browser extensions. Through a series of practical bot-based attacks that can be performed even under typical settings, we demonstrate that malicious Chrome extensions pose serious threats, including both information dispersion and harvesting, to browsers. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of Chrome’s extension security model, and conclude that its vulnerabilities are rooted from the violation of the principles of <b>least</b> <b>privileges</b> and privilege separation. Following these principles, we propose a set of countermeasures that enforce the policies of microprivilege management and differentiating DOM elements. Using a prototype developed on the latest Chrome browser, we show that they can effectively mitigate the threats posed by malicious Chrome extensions with little effect on normal browsing experience. ...|$|R
40|$|Browser Extensions (often called plugins or addons) {{are small}} pieces of code that let {{developers}} add additional functionality to the browser. However, with extensions comes a security price: the user must trust the developer. We look at ways in which this trust can be broken and malicious extensions installed. We also look at silent installations of plugins in various browsers and work on ways to make silent installations possible in browsers that work against it. We compare the browser extension mechanism among various browsers, and {{try to create a}} set of rules to maintain the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privileges</b> in the browser. We track various plugins and determine whether the <b>least</b> <b>privileges</b> required match with the privileges asked for. We also work on a survey of extensions (for various browsers) and determine the nature of attacks possible. For eg, if a developer account gets hacked, updating of a normal extension with a malicious one is possible. We look at privilege abuse and survey extensions that ask for more privileges than they use. We finally provide a solution and allow a person to check the authenticity of the extension even before they download it. Comment: More information on the following links: [URL] [URL] [URL]...|$|R

25|$|Rootkits {{employ a}} variety of {{techniques}} to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector. The most common technique leverages security vulnerabilities to achieve surreptitious privilege escalation. Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit's installation program as benignin this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial. The installation task is made easier if the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege</b> is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges. Other classes of rootkits can be installed only by someone with physical access to the target system. Some rootkits may also be installed intentionally by the owner of the system or somebody authorized by the owner, e.g. for the purpose of employee monitoring, rendering such subversive techniques unnecessary. The installation of malicious rootkits is commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.|$|E

2500|$|A typical Windows user has {{administrative}} privileges, {{mostly for}} convenience. Because of this, any program the user runs has unrestricted {{access to the}} system.

5000|$|Modern {{processor}} architectures {{have multiple}} CPU modes {{that allows the}} OS to run at different privilege levels. Some processors have two levels (such as user and supervisor); i386+ processors have four levels (#0 with the most, #3 with the <b>least</b> <b>privileges).</b> Tasks are tagged with a privilege level. Resources (segments, pages, ports, etc.) and the privileged instructions are tagged with a demanded privilege level. When a task tries to use a resource, or execute a privileged instruction, the processor determines whether it has the permission (if not, a [...] "protection fault" [...] interrupt is generated). This prevents user tasks from damaging the OS or each other.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{emerging}} ubiquitous computing, related nomadic users often perform {{similar tasks}} {{and share the}} same computing infrastructure. This means that security of the shared resources is of prime importance. Frequent delegation of tasks among users must be anticipated as most nomadic environments are hectic and very dynamic. A delegation mechanism with a slightly complicated user interface will not only reduce the productivity but also provide nomadic users with a strong motivation to circumvent the mechanism itself. Delegation in access control domain is not practical for the most of nomadic users due to its complicated and complex structure. Identity delegation at authentication level provides improved usability, which {{reduces the risk of}} circumventing the delegation mechanism; at the same time, however, identity delegation violates the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privileges.</b> We use contextual information of a delegatee to mitigate this violation, which helps to achieve a higher level of practical security in nomadic environments...|$|R

2500|$|The tranquility {{principle}} of the Bell–LaPadula model states that the classification of a subject or object does not change while it is being referenced. There are two forms to the tranquility principle: the [...] "{{principle of}} strong tranquility" [...] states that security levels do not change during the normal operation of the system. The [...] "principle of weak tranquility" [...] states that security levels may never change {{in such a way}} as to violate a defined security policy. Weak tranquility is desirable as it allows systems to observe the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege.</b> That is, processes start with a low clearance level regardless of their owners clearance, and progressively accumulate higher clearance levels as actions require it.|$|E
2500|$|System {{hardening}} {{represents one}} of the first layers of defence against a rootkit, to prevent it from being able to install. Applying security patches, implementing the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privilege,</b> reducing the attack surface and installing antivirus software are some standard security best practices that are effective against all classes of malware. New secure boot specifications like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface have been designed to address the threat of bootkits, but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized. For server systems, remote server attestation using technologies such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) provide a way of validating that servers remain in a known good state. For example, Microsoft Bitlocker encrypting data-at-rest validates servers are in a known [...] "good state" [...] on bootup. PrivateCore vCage is a software offering that secures data-in-use (memory) to avoid bootkits and rootkits by validating servers are in a known [...] "good" [...] state on bootup. The PrivateCore implementation works in concert with Intel TXT and locks down server system interfaces to avoid potential bootkits and rootkits.|$|E

40|$|Grids are {{intended}} to enable cross-organizational interactions which makes Grid security a challenging and nontrivial issue. In Grids, delegation is a key facility {{that can be used}} to authenticate and authorize requests on behalf of disconnected users. In current Grid systems there is a tradeoff between flexibility and security in the context of delegation. Applications must choose between limited or full delegation: on one hand, delegating a restricted set of rights reduces exposure to attack but also limits the flexibility/dynamism of the application; on the other hand, delegating all rights provides maximum flexibility but increases exposure. In this paper, we propose an on-demand restricted delegation mechanism, aimed at addressing the shortcomings of current delegation mechanisms by providing restricted delegation in a flexible fashion as needed for Grid applications. This mechanism provides an ontology-based solution for tackling one the most challenging issues in security systems, which is the principle of <b>least</b> <b>privileges.</b> It utilizes a callback mechanism, which allows on-demand provisioning of delegated credentials in addition to observing, screening, and auditing delegated rights at runtime. This mechanism provides support for generating delegation credentials with a very limited and well-defined range of capabilities or policies, where a delegator is able to grant a delegatee a set of restricted and limited rights, implicitly or explicitly...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{need-to-know}} principle {{needs to be}} in effect when talking about access control. Need-to-know principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government, when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the {{need-to-know principle}}, network administrators grant the employee <b>least</b> amount <b>privileges</b> to prevent employees access and doing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability (C‑I‑A) triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.|$|R

50|$|<b>Least</b> <b>privilege</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with privilege bracketing: that is, assuming necessary privileges at the last possible moment and dismissing them as soon as no longer strictly necessary, therefore ostensibly reducing fallout from erroneous code that unintentionally exploits more privilege than is merited. <b>Least</b> <b>privilege</b> has also been interpreted in the context of distribution of discretionary access control (DAC) permissions, for example asserting that giving user U read/write access to file F violates <b>least</b> <b>privilege</b> if U can complete his authorized tasks with only read permission.|$|E
50|$|Another {{point of}} {{internal}} control is {{adherence to the}} principle of providing the <b>least</b> amount of <b>privileges,</b> especially in production.

The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.|$|R

40|$|Database as {{a service}} {{provides}} services for accessing and managing customers data which provides ease of access, and the cost is less for these services. There {{is a possibility that}} the DBaaS service provider may not be trusted, and data may be stored on untrusted server. The access control mechanism can restrict users from unauthorized access, but in cloud environment access control policies are more flexible. However, an attacker can gather sensitive information for a malicious purpose by abusing the privileges as another user and so database security is compromised. The other problems associated with the DBaaS are to manage role hierarchy and secure session management for query transaction in the database. In this paper, a role-based access control for the multitenant database with role hierarchy is proposed. The query is granted with <b>least</b> access <b>privileges,</b> and a session key is used for session management. The proposed work protects data from privilege escalation and SQL injection. It uses the partial homomorphic encryption (Paillier Encryption) for the encrypting the sensitive data. If a query is to perform any operation on sensitive data, then extra permissions are required for accessing sensitive data. Data confidentiality and integrity are achieved using the role-based access control with partial homomorphic encryption.
