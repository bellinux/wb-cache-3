2500|$|The phage {{particle}} {{consists of}} a head (also known as a capsid), a tail, and tail fibers (see image of virus below). The head contains the phage's double-strand linear DNA genome. During infection, the phage particle recognizes and binds to its host, E. coli, causing DNA in {{the head of the}} phage to be ejected through the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Usually, a [...] "lytic cycle" [...] ensues, where the lambda DNA is replicated and new phage particles are produced within the cell. This is followed by cell lysis, releasing the cell contents, including virions that have been assembled, into the environment. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the lysogenic pathway. In this state, the λ DNA is called a prophage and stays resident within the host's genome without apparent harm to the host. The host is [...] termed a <b>lysogen</b> when a prophage is present. This prophage may enter the lytic cycle when the <b>lysogen</b> enters a stressed condition.|$|E

In lambda N- cIts 2 or lambda N-cIts 16 <b>lysogens</b> superinfected with lambda trp/lac N+, beta-galactosidase appeared earlier and was synthesized more rapidly than in superinfected <b>lysogens</b> containing lambda N- cIts 857 prophage. Even at 45 degrees C, the cI 857 repressor retained some activity. <b>Lysogens</b> containing other N-cIts mutant prophages producing renaturable repressors were also only partially derepressed at 43 degrees C. Partial derepression of lambda "early" transcription is sufficient for induction of lambda N+ prophages...|$|R

The double <b>lysogens</b> were identified by analysis of their monolysogenic segregants and by examining their deoxyribonucleic acid in certain test crosses. The results indicate that the majority had been formed by insertion of the infecting phage genome within the resident prophage. Superinfection of transformable bacteria gave rise to cells with altered prophages (presumably transformants) and to double <b>lysogens</b> which had gained or lost wild-type prophage loci...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in gene N of λ prevent {{killing of}} the host {{bacterium}} after infection. However, derepression of Nsus prophages in nonpermissive (pm−) bacteria results in death of the <b>lysogens.</b> When prophages in pm−(λCItsA-Nsus) <b>lysogens</b> are derepressed by raising the temperature to 45 C, the cells remain viable {{as long as they}} are at 45 C. However, they cannot form colonies at 33 C unless they have been superinfected, at the high temperature, by λCI+-Nsus phage which produces repressor at 45 C. A large fraction of these “rescued,” heat-inducible <b>lysogens</b> are lysogenized by the superinfecting phage, but lysogenization is not required for rescue. In pm−(λCItsA-Nsus) <b>lysogens</b> growing at 45 C, the rate of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis shows a characteristic increase after the temperature is lowered. This increased DNA synthesis, which is correlated with loss of rescue potential, does not occur as long as the cultures are maintained at 45 C...|$|R
40|$|The outer {{membrane}} of Escherichia coli was altered as {{a consequence}} of lysogeny by bacteriophages P 1 and P 1 cmts. The predominant change was a reduction in the size of lipopolysaccharide to a heptose-deficient form. P 1 cmts <b>lysogens</b> were still sensitive to several bacteriophages but were resistant to lambda vir. Neither whole cells nor solubilized outer membranes from P 1 cmts <b>lysogens</b> were able to inactivate lambda vir, and 32 P-labeled lambda vir was unable to adsorb to P 1 cmts <b>lysogens.</b> P 1 cmts <b>lysogens</b> were also affected in maltose transport. The level of periplasmic maltose-binding protein was reduced somewhat, but there was no significant reduction in the level of the outer membrane lambda receptor (LamB). These membrane abnormalities were all corrected in strains cured of P 1 cmts. It is suggested that P 1 cmts affects lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by a phage conversion mechanism and consequently the function of the lambda receptor...|$|R

A total of 191 C 7 (beta 197) tox- <b>lysogens</b> were isolated and selected according to the halo produced on TYE agar containing antidiphtheria toxin serum and were further characterized by Southern blots of their chromosomal DNA. Most of the isolates {{turned out to be}} monolysogens, but some tandem and nontandem double <b>lysogens</b> were also found. The nontandem double <b>lysogens</b> were stable and capable of giving high yields of CRM 197, up to threefold higher than monolysogens. They are, therefore, suitable for large-scale industrial production...|$|R
50|$|When a cell is {{undergoing}} the lysogenic cycle and infected with a lambda phage (making it a lambda <b>lysogen),</b> other lambda phages that infect it {{are not able}} to undergo lytic development and produce progeny. The incoming phage can inject its DNA into the cell, but the DNA is immediately repressed and no transcription of genes or translation of phage proteins initiates. Therefore, lambda lysogens are immune to infection by other lambda phage particles. This occurs because the lambda <b>lysogen</b> is continuously producing cI repressor proteins {{to the point where the}} amount of cI proteins in the cell exceeds the amount needed to inhibit the replication of more than one phage. These repressor proteins bind to the superinfecting phage DNA operators to block transcription of the phage's genes by the cell and viral polymerase enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Non-virulent {{bacteria}} {{have also}} been shown to transform into highly virulent pathogens through lysogenic conversion with the virulence factors carried on the lysogenic prophage. Virulence genes carried within prophages as discrete autonomous genetic elements, known as morons, confer an advantage to the bacteria that indirectly benefits the virus through enhanced <b>lysogen</b> survival.|$|E

He demonstrated through his classical experiments the inducible nature of the DNA repair system.|$|E

Amber 20 - mutants have been obtained. There are {{differences between these}} T 7 mutations and the similar T 4 rII mutations. There are host mutations which permit T 7 20 - mutants to grow on lambda+ <b>lysogens.</b> T 7 DNA synthesis on normal lambda+ <b>lysogens</b> infected with 20 - mutants is essentially normal, but the DNA is not packaged. The gene 20 protein is active in in vitro complementation and probably used late in infection for DNA packaging into phage heads...|$|R
40|$|HK 022, a {{temperate}} coliphage {{related to}} lambda, forms <b>lysogens</b> by inserting its DNA into the bacterial chromosome through site-specific recombination. The Escherichia coli Fis and phage Xis proteins promote excision of HK 022 DNA from the bacterial chromosome. These two proteins also act during lysogenization {{to prevent a}} prophage rearrangement: <b>lysogens</b> formed {{in the absence of}} either Fis or Xis frequently carried a prophage that had suffered a site-specific internal DNA inversion. The inversion is a product of recombination between the phage attachment site and a secondary attachment site located within the HK 022 left operon. In the absence of both Fis and Xis, the majority of <b>lysogens</b> carried a prophage with an inversion. Inversion occurs during lysogenization {{at about the same time}} as prophage insertion but is rare during lytic phage growth. Phages carrying the inverted segment are viable but have a defect in lysogenization, and we therefore suggest that prevention of this rearrangement is an important biological role of Xis and Fis for HK 022. Although Fis and Xis are known to promote excision of lambda prophage, they had no detectable effect on lambda recombination at secondary attachment sites. HK 022 cIts <b>lysogens</b> that were blocked in excisive recombination because of mutation in fis or xis typically produced high yields of phage after thermal induction, regardless of whether they carried an inverted prophage. The usual requirement for prophage excision was bypassed in these <b>lysogens</b> because they carried two or more prophages inserted in tandem at the bacterial attachment site; in such <b>lysogens,</b> viable phage particles can be formed by in situ packaging of unexcised chromosomes...|$|R

40|$|A {{bacteriophage}} T 4 gene which {{functions to}} inhibit Escherichia coli Lon protease has been identified. This pin (proteolysis inhibition) gene {{was selected for}} its ability to support plaque formation by a lambda Ots vector at 40 degrees C. Southern blot experiments indicated that this T 4 gene is included within the 4. 9 -kilobase XbaI fragment which contains gene 49. Subcloning experiments showed that T 4 gene 49. 1 (designated pinA) is responsible for the ability of the Ots vector to form plaques at 40 degrees C. Deficiencies in Lon protease activity are the only changes known in E. coli that permit lambda Ots phage to form plaques efficiently at 40 degrees C. lon+ <b>lysogens</b> of the lambda Ots vector containing pinA permitted a lambda Ots phage to form plaques efficiently at 40 degrees C. Furthermore, these <b>lysogens,</b> upon comparison with similar <b>lysogens</b> lacking any T 4 DNA, showed reduced levels of degradation of puromycyl polypeptides and of canavanyl proteins. The lon+ <b>lysogens</b> that contained pinA exhibited other phenotypic characteristics common to lon strains, such as filamentation and production of mucoid colonies. Levels of degradation of canavanyl proteins were essentially the same, however, in null lon <b>lysogens</b> which either contained or lacked pinA. We infer from these data that the T 4 pinA gene functions to block Lon protease activity; pinA does not, however, appear to block the activity of proteases other than Lon that are involved in the degradation of abnormal proteins...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} {{a specialized}} transducing phage carrying the polC locus of E. coli K- 12.

40|$|The N protein of {{bacteriophage}} lambda {{is a positive}} regulator of early λ gene expression. In a λtrp transducing phage, λtrp 46 Nam, the synthesis of trp enzymes in vivo is also dependent {{on the presence of}} active N protein. The DNA of this phage has been used in a protein-synthesizing system in vitro to develop a biochemical assay for the activity of the N protein. From the following observations it appears that it is the N protein itself that stimulates trp enzyme synthesis in vitro. An activity that stimulates trp enzyme synthesis can be made in vitro by λN+ DNA but not by λNam DNA. This activity can also be detected in extracts of induced λN+ <b>lysogens</b> but not of λNam <b>lysogens.</b> Furthermore, the activity is temperature sensitive in similar extracts of λNts <b>lysogens.</b> No such activity is detectable in extracts of induced <b>lysogens</b> of λimm 21. This phage makes all λ-coded gene products outside the immunity region, but lacks an N protein activity able to substitute for Nλ protein in vivo. Our experiments also show that the action of N protein is inhibited by the cI repressor protein in vivo as it is in vivo...|$|R
50|$|A <b>lysogen</b> or {{lysogenic}} bacterium is a bacterial cell {{in which a}} phage exists as DNA in its dormant state (prophage). A prophage is either integrated into the host bacteria's chromosome or more rarely exists as a stable plasmid within the host cell. The prophage expresses gene(s) that repress the phage's lytic action, until this repression is disrupted (see lytic cycle). Currently a variety of studies are being conducted to see whether other genes are active during lysogeny, examples of which include phage-encoded tRNA and virulence genes.|$|E
50|$|The BlyA {{membrane}} protein and the BlyB soluble accessory protein are encoded on the conserved cp32 plasmid of Borrelia burgdorferi, {{which can be}} packaged into a bacteriophage particle. These two proteins had previously been proposed to comprise a hemolysis system, but Damman et al. (2000) provided evidence that BlyAB functions as a prophage-encoded holin system. BlyA promotes endolysin-dependent lysis of an induced lambda <b>lysogen</b> that is defective for the lambda holin S gene. The holin pores are generally stable and nonspecific, allowing endolysin access to the peptidoglycan.|$|E
50|$|Transduction happens through {{either the}} lytic cycle or the {{lysogenic}} cycle.If the lysogenic cycle is adopted, the phage chromosome is integrated (by covalent bonds) into the bacterial chromosome, {{where it can}} remain dormant for thousands of generations.

50|$|In virology, {{temperate}} {{refers to}} the ability of some bacteriophages (notably coliphage λ) to display a lysogenic life cycle. Many (but not all) temperate phages can integrate their genomes into their host bacterium's chromosome, together becoming a <b>lysogen</b> as the phage genome becomes a prophage. A temperate phage is also able to undergo a productive, typically lytic life cycle, where the prophage is expressed, replicates the phage genome, and produces phage progeny, which then leave the bacterium. With phage the term virulent is often used as an antonym to temperate, but more strictly a virulent phage is one that has lost its ability to display lysogeny through mutation rather than a phage lineage with no genetic potential to ever display lysogeny (which more properly would be described as an obligately lytic phage).|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of λ phage in the Rec− strain JC- 1569 is {{compared with that}} in the Rec+ strain JC- 1557. No difference deemed significant was noted in the adsorption rate, latent period, burst size, frequency of lysogenization, and frequency of vegetative phage recombination. The location of the prophage and its mode of insertion in the Rec− <b>lysogen</b> of wild-type λ (λ+) were inferred to be normal {{from the results of}} conjugational crosses. Spontaneous and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induction of λ+ were markedly reduced in the Rec− <b>lysogen.</b> On the other hand, thermal induction of a mutant lambda (λcI 857) <b>lysogen</b> of the Rec− strain was not reduced and was only slightly affected by UV irradiation. Phage subject to inhibition by λ immunity failed to multiply in UV-irradiated cells of the Rec− λ+ <b>lysogen,</b> whereas those not inhibited by this immunity did multiply. It was concluded that the failure of UV to induce λ+ in the Rec− <b>lysogen</b> was not due to damage to the prophage, but rather to the inability of the irradiated cells to respond by lifting immunity. Preliminary evidence indicates that a single mutation confers recombination deficiency and the inability to lift immunity after UV irradiation. Possible relationships between recombination and the lifting of immunity are enumerated...|$|E
40|$|How {{temperate}} bacteriophages {{play a role}} in microbial {{infection and}} disease progression is not fully understood. They do this in part by carrying genes that promote positive evolutionary selection for the <b>lysogen.</b> Using Biolog phenotype microarrays and comparative metabolite profiling we demonstrate the impact of the well-characterised Shiga toxin-prophage φ 24 B on its Escherichia coli host MC 1061. As a <b>lysogen,</b> the prophage alters the bacterial physiology by increasing the rates of respiration and cell proliferation. This is the first reported study detailing phage-mediated control of the E. coli biotin and fatty acid synthesis that is rate limiting to cell growth. Through φ 24 B conversion the <b>lysogen</b> also gains increased antimicrobial tolerance to chloroxylenol and 8 -hydroxyquinoline. Distinct metabolite profiles discriminate between MC 1061 and the φ 24 B <b>lysogen</b> in standard culture, and when treated with 2 antimicrobials. This is also the first reported use of metabolite profiling to characterise the physiological impact of lysogeny under antimicrobial pressure. We propose that temperate phages do not need to carry antimicrobial resistance genes to {{play a significant role in}} tolerance to antimicrobials...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{synthetic}} gene regulatory circuits can {{provide insight into}} circuit behavior and evolution. An alternative approach is to modify a naturally occurring circuit, by using genetic methods to select functional circuits and evolve their properties. We have applied this approach to the circuitry of phage λ. This phage grows lytically, forms stable <b>lysogens,</b> and can switch from this regulatory state to lytic growth. Genetic selections are available for each behavior. We previously replaced λ Cro in the intact phage with a module including Lac repressor, whose function is tunable with small molecules, and several cis-acting sites. Here, we have in addition replaced λ CI repressor with another tunable module, Tet repressor and several cis-acting sites. Tet repressor lacks several important properties of CI, including positive autoregulation and cooperative DNA binding. Using a combinatorial approach, we isolated phage variants with behavior {{similar to that of}} WT λ. These variants grew lytically and formed stable <b>lysogens.</b> <b>Lysogens</b> underwent prophage induction upon addition of a ligand that weakens binding by the Tet repressor. Strikingly, however, addition of a ligand that weakens binding by Lac repressor also induced <b>lysogens.</b> This finding indicates that Lac repressor was present in the <b>lysogens</b> and was necessary for stable lysogeny. Therefore, these isolates had an altered wiring diagram from that of λ. We speculate that this complexity is needed to compensate for the missing features. Our method is generally useful for making customized gene regulatory circuits whose activity is regulated by small molecules or protein cofactors...|$|R

Genetic studies of this mutant led to the isolation of a derivative that formed unstable <b>lysogens.</b> These studies suggested that the ban product was normally under c 1 control; they further showed that ant overcame c 1 repression by inactivating c 1 rather than by creating a bypass of repressor activity...|$|R
