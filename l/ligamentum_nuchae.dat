50|$|Paddywhack (also spelt paddywack) or nuchal {{ligament}} (Latin: <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae),</b> {{is a strong}} elastic ligament in the midline of the neck of sheep or cattle which relieves the animal {{of the weight of}} its head. It is pale yellow in colour. (The yellow colour is the elastin on the ligaments.) The name is derived from the corruption of paxwax (originally faxwax Old English hair + to grow).|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} or upper (or descending) fibers of the trapezius {{originate from}} the spinous process of C7, the external occipital protuberance, the medial {{third of the}} superior nuchal line of the occipital bone (both {{in the back of}} the head), and the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae.</b> From this origin they proceed downward and laterally to be inserted into the posterior border of the lateral third of the clavicle.|$|E
50|$|Elastins, in {{contrast}} to collagens, give elasticity to tissues, allowing them to stretch when needed {{and then return to}} their original state. This is useful in blood vessels, the lungs, in skin, and the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae,</b> and these tissues contain high amounts of elastins. Elastins are synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Elastins are highly insoluble, and tropoelastins are secreted inside a chaperone molecule, which releases the precursor molecule upon contact with a fiber of mature elastin. Tropoelastins are then deaminated to become incorporated into the elastin strand. Disorders such as cutis laxa and Williams syndrome are associated with deficient or absent elastin fibers in the ECM.|$|E

The results confirm that, at least in beef <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae,</b> elastic fibers consist of beaded filaments which can be oriented by stretching {{in the direction of}} the force applied. Moreover, atomic force microscopy revealed that these beaded filaments are laterally connected by periodical bridges which become more pronounced upon stretching.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} process of elastogenic {{differentiation}} in the bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> to assess the mechanisms that regulate elastin gene expression during development. Undifferentiated (nonelastin-producing) ligament cells from early gestation animals initiate elastin synthesis when grown on an extracellular matrix (ECM) substratum prepared from late gestation <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae.</b> ECM from ligaments of fetal calves younger than the time when elastin production occurs spontaneously in situ (i. e., beginning the last developmental trimester at- 180 d of gestation) does not stimulate elastin production in undifferentiated cells. Matrixinduced differentiation requires direct cell matrix interaction, is dependent upon cell proliferation after cell-matrix contact, and can be blocked selectively by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the DNA of undifferentiated cells before (but not after) contact with inducing matrix. Quantitative analysis of elastin synthesis in young cells after matrix-induced differentiation indicates that the entire cell population is competent {{to respond to the}} matrix inducer, and continued synthesis of elastin after young cells are removed from the ECM substratum indicates that the phenotypic transition to elastin synthesis is stable and heritable.

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{examination of}} fragmented elastic tissue obtained from fish swim bladder, bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae,</b> and aortas of various mammals, including man, reveals characteristically formed fibers and much amorphous material. Boiling in dilute acid destroys the associated collagen {{but does not}} obviously alter the elastic tissue. Digestion in crystalline trypsin of either boiled or unheated tissue {{from any of the}} above-mentioned sources causes the release of thin threads ranging in length from 0. 1 µ to many microns. A large proportion of these threads are evenly and tightly coiled double helices formed from at least two interlacing filaments and measuring about 120 A in width. The distance between coils ranges from about 470 to 590 A. The individual smooth filaments, many of which are present in parallel pairs, measure approximately 70 A in width. Raising the pH of a neutral suspension of threads from <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> lowers the ratio of helical threads to uncoiled filaments, whereas lowering the pH with acetic acid results in clumping of threads with complete loss of identity at about pH 3. 6. Threads and filaments obtained from all sources studied were destroyed in the temperature range 75 – 85 °C. at pH 7. It is concluded that the elastic fiber is a two component system composed of bundles of trypsin-resistant threads of characteristic form and size plus a trypsin-sensitive, heat-resistant "amorphous" binding matrix.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging findings {{in patients with}} acute whiplash injury with those in matched control subjects. Materials and Methods: In a prospective multicenter controlled study, from 2005 to 2008, 100 consecutive patients underwent 1. 5 -T MR imaging examinations of the cervical spine within 48 hours after a motor vehicle accident. Findings in these patients were compared {{in a blinded fashion}} with those in 100 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Four blinded independent readers assessed the presence of occult vertebral body and facet fractures, vertebral body and facet contusions, intervertebral disk herniations, <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> strains, <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> tears, muscle strains or tears, and perimuscular fluid. Accuracy (as compared with clinical findings) and interobserver reliability were calculated. Results: Accuracy of MR imaging and interreader reliability were generally poor (sensitivity, 0. 328; specificity, 0. 728; positive and negative likelihood ratios, 1. 283 and 1. 084, respectively). MR imaging findings significantly associated with whiplash injuries were occult fracture (P <. 01), bone marrow contusion of the vertebral body (P =. 01), muscle strain (P <. 01) or tear (P <. 01), and the presence of perimuscular fluid (P <. 01). While 10 findings thought to be specific for whiplash trauma were significantly (P <. 01) more frequent in patients (507 observations), they were also regularly found in healthy control subjects (237 observations). There were no serious occult injuries that required immediate therapy. Conclusion: MR imaging at 1. 5 T reveals only limited evidence of specific changes to the cervical spine and the surrounding tissues in patients with acute symptomatic whiplash injury compared with healthy control subjects...|$|E

40|$|Fetal bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> {{fibroblasts}} {{maintained in}} culture synthesized soluble elastin but {{were unable to}} form the insoluble elastic fiber. Secreted elastin precursors accumulated in culture medium and were measured using a radioimmunoassay for elastin. When elastin production was examined in ligament tissue from fetal calves of various gestational ages, cells from tissue taken during the last trimester of development produced significantly more elastin than did cells from younger fetal tissue, with maximal elastin synthesis occurring shortly before birth. Soluble elastin was detected in ligament cells plated at low density until proliferation began to be density inhibited and the cells became quiescent. Also, soluble elastin production per cell declined with increasing population doubling or with age in culture. Cells grown {{in the presence of}} 5 % fetal calf serum produced approximately four times as much soluble elastin as cells grown in serum-free medium. The addition of dexamethasone (0. 1 microM) and bleomycin (1 microgram/ml) increased soluble elastin production by cultured cells 180 % and 50 %, respectively, whereas theophylline (5 micrograms/ml) depressed production 50 % and antagonized stimulation by dexamethasone. Ascorbate (50 micrograms/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml), insulin (100 microunits/ml), and aminoacetonitrile (50 micrograms/ml) had no effect, but cycloheximide at 10 (- 4) M completely inhibited soluble elastin production. In contrast to cells in culture, ligament tissue minces (ligament cells surrounded by in vivo extracellular matrix) efficiently incorporated soluble elastin precursors into insoluble, cross-linked elastin. In addition, soluble elastin production per cell (per microgram of DNA) was higher in tissue minces than elastin production by cells maintained on plastic. These results suggest a role for extracellular matrix in formation of the elastic fiber and in stabilizing elastin phenotypic expression by ligament fibroblasts.

40|$|We {{studied the}} process of elastogenic {{differentiation}} in the bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> to assess the mechanisms that regulate elastin gene expression during development. Undifferentiated (nonelastin - producing) ligament cells from early gestation animals initiate elastin synthesis when grown on an extracellular matrix (ECM) substratum prepared from late gestation <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae.</b> ECM from ligaments of fetal calves younger than the time when elastin production occurs spontaneously in situ (i. e., beginning the last developmental trimester at approximately 180 d of gestation) does not stimulate elastin production in undifferentiated cells. Matrix-induced differentiation requires direct cell matrix interaction, is dependent upon cell proliferation after cell-matrix contact, and can be blocked selectively by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the DNA of undifferentiated cells before (but not after) contact with inducing matrix. Quantitative analysis of elastin synthesis in young cells after matrix-induced differentiation indicates that the entire cell population is competent {{to respond to the}} matrix inducer, and continued synthesis of elastin after young cells are removed from the ECM substratum indicates that the phenotypic transition to elastin synthesis is stable and heritable. Although ligament cells do not require continuous contact with ECM to express the elastin phenotype, elastin synthesis is increased substantially when elastin-producing cells are grown on ligament matrix, suggesting that elastogenic differentiation is stabilized by ECM. The matrix substratum was also found to alter the distribution of tropoelastin between the medium and matrix cell layer. When grown on tissue culture plastic, ligament cells secrete greater than 80 % of newly synthesized tropoelastin into the culture medium. When cultured on ECM, however, 50 - 70 % of the newly synthesized tropoelastin remains associated with the cell layer and is cross-linked to form insoluble elastin as shown by the incorporation of radiolabeled lysine into desmosine...|$|E

40|$|Desmosine-enriched {{peptides}} {{were isolated}} from a thermolysin digest of bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> elastin and a partial sequence was determined. A 'two-cross-link' model is proposed {{in which a}} second cross-link, perhaps lysinonorleucine, joins two peptide chains approx. 35 amino acid residues removed from the desmosine. Implied in this model is a certain asymmetry or directionality which places restrictions on the 'sense' of the peptide chains (either always parallel or anti-parallel) in order to align the cross-linking sites. Imposing such restrictions raises the possibility of specific alignment of elastin precursor molecules by microfibrillar proteins and/or aligning peptides on the precursor molecules themselves. The lysine-derived cross-links in elastin (Franzblau, 1971) in large measure contribute to the protein's elastic mechanical properties. Their formation involves enzymic oxidation of certain lysine c-amino groups, forming a-aminoadipic acid 5 -semialdehyde (allysine) (Lent et al., 1969). Once formed, thes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We studied {{chemotaxis}} to elastin peptides by bovine <b>ligamentum</b> <b>nuchae</b> fibroblasts {{to determine}} whether there is a developmental association between chemotactic responsiveness to elastin and expression of the elastin phenotype. Undifferentiated ligament cells demonstrate chemotactic responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor and fibronectin, known chemoattractants for fibroblasts, but do not show chemotaxis to elastin peptides. After matrix-induced differentiation, however, young cells display a positive chemotactic response to elastin that persists even after the cells are removed from the matrix substratum. Matrix-induced chemotaxis to elastin could be inhibited selectively by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA of undifferentiated cells before (but not after) contact with inducing matrix. These results show that the appearance of chemotaxis to elastin peptides parallels the onset of elastin synthesis and suggests that the acquisition of chemotactic responsiveness to elastin and expression of the elastin phenotype are affected by the same inducing elements or processes and may be closely coupled in development.

There were also areas, along the regular network, in which ridges of various lengths, packed with perpendicular side filaments, were visible. In replicas of deep-etched and rotary-shadowed specimens, a thicker and more defined three-dimensional network was observable. A great variability in appearance among the globular subunits of the filaments was noticed which was at least partially due to the etching treatment. By means of computerized simulation of replicas of various hypothetically collapsed globular structures, we obtained patterns which were superimposable on those obtained in the replicas of the specimens analyzed. It is thus assumed that each globular subunit of the filament, being subjected to collapsing, has a less dense central core...|$|E

To further understand the role of fibrillin-microfibrils in vertebrate elastic fibers, layers of fibrillin-microfibrils were subjected to nano-indentation tests.
