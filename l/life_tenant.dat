50|$|The {{estate was}} worth {{approximately}} £ 29,000 and was {{invested in a}} mortgage loan secured over three farms at 5 per cent. In January of 1889 the mortgage fell into arrears and in May of that year the trustees went into possession. It was anticipated that upon {{the sale of the}} farms, the purchase price would not be sufficient to pay all of the accrued interest as well as the outstanding capital amounts. Accordingly, the Barbers' Company brought a summons in March 1892 {{to determine whether or not}} the mortgage ought to be foreclosed in this manner. The court ordered that the farms be sold. The first farm was sold for £ 4,600, and in 1903 the nieces and nephews as <b>life</b> <b>tenants</b> took out a further summons to determine (amongst other things) the entitlement as between the <b>life</b> <b>tenants</b> (entitled to the income) and the remainderman (entitled to the capital) in relation to those proceeds of sale.|$|R

5000|$|When {{an owner}} of land in fee simple died, {{the lord of the}} fee was {{entitled}} to [...] "incidents of tenure" [...] deriving from the descent to the heir (analogous to the modern day estate tax). Large landowners who desired the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> (who was perhaps the landowner himself, conveying through a straw party) to avoid the estate tax attempted to create a future interest {{in the form of a}} remainder in the heirs of that <b>life</b> <b>tenant.</b> It was the intention of the landowner or testator to allow the heirs of the <b>life</b> <b>tenant,</b> once ascertained at the natural expiration of his life estate, to take as purchasers by way of the original executed conveyance, and not by descent, avoiding the tax.|$|E

50|$|Where {{there is}} a duty to convert under the rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth, there is, {{in the absence of}} an {{intention}} that the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> shall enjoy the income until sale, the second limb of the rule is that the trustee is under a duty also to apportion the property fairly between the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> and the remainderman until conversion.

50|$|Allhusen v Whitell (1867) LR 4 Eq 295 is an English trusts law case which {{lays down}} {{a rule of}} equity which {{requires}} the trustee of a trust to strike a fair balance between the beneficiaries who are tenants for life {{and those who are}} remaindermen in respect of payment of the debts of an estate. The <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> under a will is entitled to income earned after the testator's death, but it often takes some time to ascertain and settle all of those debts. In the meantime the assets of the estate are earning income for tenant for life, whereas the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> should only receive income from the estate net of the debts; the rule in Allhusen v White requires the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> to make a contribution.|$|E
50|$|The fee tail {{has been}} {{abolished}} {{in all but}} four states in the United States: Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware and Rhode Island. However, {{in the first three}} states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the <b>life</b> <b>tenant's</b> children. New York abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a fee simple; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.|$|R

5000|$|A {{reversion}} {{in property}} {{law is a}} future interest that is retained by the grantor after the conveyance of an estate of a lesser quantum that he has (such {{as the owner of}} a fee simple granting a life estate or a leasehold estate). Once the lesser estate comes to an end (the lease expires or the <b>life</b> estate <b>tenant</b> dies), the property automatically reverts (hence reversion) back to the grantor.|$|R
5000|$|Under English law and Australian law, {{equitable}} waste is waste that a <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> {{has a right}} to commit at common law but is restrained by a court of equity. This doctrine fits under the broader framework of equity, in which a legal right to do something is not so unrestrained {{that it is impossible to}} abuse that right. A <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> who is granted an estate [...] "without impeachment of waste" [...] (may not be sued for waste) may not commit acts of flagrant destruction inconsistent with the fruitful use of the land. For example, a mansion may not be stripped of its glass, timber or pipes (Vane v Lord barnard), nor may trees of an ornamental value be cut down by the <b>life</b> <b>tenant</b> (Turner v Wright).! ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a life estate owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the <b>life</b> <b>tenant's</b> ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life embedded life estate, then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or pur autre vie interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|R
