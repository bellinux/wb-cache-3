50|$|The Free Schools Act of 1871 {{added to}} the taxpayer's burden {{the cost of the}} {{education}} system. The Common Schools Act, also of 1871 (CSA), established a whole new system in the province; the place of religion in the school system was a topic of debate as early as 1863, and this Act was its ostensible solution: schools became non-sectarian. Opposition was directed at Sections 14 through 18, which concerned the <b>levy</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> on all private property throughout each (newly-ordained) District, and Section 60, in which a non-sectarian system was specified. The Grammar Schools were allowed until 1884 to operate independently. Schools were financed from three sources: 1) school district poll tax on all male inhabitants of the district above 21 years of age; 2) school district property tax (real or personal) and income tax applied to non-residents' and residents' property alike; 3) County School fund tax equal to 30 cents per inhabitant according to the previous census.|$|E
50|$|Urged by his Georgian or Circassian mother, {{the sultan}} sought advice and counsel from Europe and {{endeavored}} {{to act on}} it, but advice not motivated by {{a conflict of interest}} was difficult to obtain, and in spite of the unquestionable desire of the young ruler to do the best for the country, wild extravagance both in action and expenditure resulted, leaving the sultan with depleted exchequer and the confidence of his people impaired. His intimacy with foreigners and his imitation of their ways were sufficient to rouse strong popular opposition and create dissatisfaction.His attempt to reorganize the finances by the systematic <b>levy</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> was hailed with delight, but the government was not strong enough to carry the measures through, and the money which should have been used to pay the taxes was employed to purchase firearms instead.

50|$|The main {{sources of}} royal revenue were taxes, tributes, customs duties and tolls. Taxes were called Karai or Irai, tributes called Tirai and customs tolls and duties were called Sungam. <b>Levy</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> as well as {{expenditure}} was {{at the discretion of}} the king who decided the rate and incidence of taxes, as well as any remissions. Land tax, paid in money or in kind, and income tax, equal to one-sixth of an individual’s income, were the major types of taxes collected. Other sources of revenue include tributes paid by feudal subordinates, war booty presents by loyal and visiting subjects, treasure troves besides land revenue, cess and forced gifts. Tolls were collected on the trunk-roads used by caravans and at the frontier of each kingdom. Customs were levied at seaports where the imported goods landed. The export of locally manufactured goods such as textiles, pearls etc. earned a lot of foreign exchange for the royal treasury. The king took one-tenth of the total earnings from pearl-diving and sale of pearls as his royalty.|$|E

50|$|From prerevolutionary times {{until well}} into the 1970s, animal {{husbandry}} was the mainstay of the Mongolian economy. In the traditional economy, livestock provided foodstuffs and clothing; after the 1921 revolution, livestock supplied foodstuffs and raw materials for industries and for export. Mongolia had 9.6 million head of livestock in 1918 and 13.8 million head in 1924; arad ownership was estimated to be 50 to 80 percent of all livestock, and monastic and aristocratic ownership to be 50 to 20 percent. Policies designed to force collectivization in the early 1930s met with arad resistance, including the slaughter of their own animals. Reversal of these policies led to a growth in livestock numbers, which peaked in 1941 at 27.5 million head. World War II brought new commitments to provide food and raw materials for the Soviet war effort. With the <b>levy</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> in kind, livestock numbers fell to about 20 million in 1945, and they have hovered between 20 million and 24 million head since then. Collectivization and advances in veterinary science have failed to boost livestock production significantly since the late 1940s. In 1940 animal husbandry produced 99.6 percent of gross agricultural output. The share of animal husbandry in gross agricultural output declined after World War II, to 71.8 percent in 1960, 81.6 percent in 1970, 79.5 percent in 1980, and 70 percent in 1985. The rise in crop production since 1940 has accounted for animal husbandry's decline in gross agricultural output.|$|E

To this it may be replied, as was done in Quincy v.

When the legislature in 1869 legalized and confirmed what the city council had previously done touching the subscription to the stock of the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line Railroad Company, and thereby authorized bonds in payment thereof to be issued, it could not have been contemplated that indebtedness thus created would be met by such taxation as was permitted for ordinary municipal purposes. In giving authority to incur obligations for such extraordinary indebtedness, the legislature did not restrict its corporate authorities to the limit of taxation provided for ordinary debts and expenses.
