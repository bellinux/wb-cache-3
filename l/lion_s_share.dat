ABN AMRO s predecessors, then seven commercial banks, surrendered the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of Jewish financial assets to the Nazis. How can this be explained? One possible answer is that the banks allowed their own, commercial, interests to prevail over those of their Jewish clients. Other factors were: strategies of deception by the German authorities, low level of resistance among Dutch Jews, German pressure on banks to release Jewish assets and, finally, the lengthy duration of the war. ...|$|E

So much research is summarized in this comparatively short book, that it becomes the best introduction to the subject currently available. The chapters are chronologically arranged; they focus on those diseases that have been leading causes of sickness or death {{over the last four}} centuries. Not surprisingly the epidemic and insect borne diseases receive the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of attention; but the occupational diseases are given a chapter of their own. The chronic diseases, which dominate the twentieth century, are reviewed in chapter nine. The author s general conclusion is that although a certain amount of progress has undoubtedly occurred in the treatment and management of specific diseases, there will never be a final victory over disease and death. In the present context few would disagree. ...|$|E
40|$|Most of the 1, 314 {{responses}} were received by mail. Many were typed, or in computer files. More than half were eloquent hand-written texts with some, in good Spore reader tradition, extending to several pages. More than 400 photos, intricate illustrations and sketches, engraved poems and digital diagrams accompanied them {{it is tempting}} to publish them all in an album. The fact that email and the World Wide Web were used by 14, 6 % of respondents merits attention. To those concerned about the Digital Divide, it gives some reassurance that computer-mediated communication, such as the Internet, is growing. Yet many more respondents, 31 % to be exact, claim to use email now and 10 % expect to use it by the end of 2002. It is, though, not yet part of their daily pattern of communication, at least for responding to Spore surveys. Most actually share the email address of a neighbour, colleague or friend, often on one of the free systems provided by Internet companies. This confirms the observation that Internet penetration in developing countries should not be measured by the number of email subscriptions since each one actually means perhaps ten other people. Who s talking? The language used by respondents reflects, in broad terms, the circulation of the English and French editions of Spore, and the Portuguese Esporo. Just over 54 % of {{responses were}} in English, 37 % in French and 8 % in Portuguese. Gender issues The number of women responding to the survey does not fully reflect their place in the ranks of CTA s distribution of Spore, which itself is far from a proper reflection of the place of women in ACP agriculture. This is a priority action area for CTA. In all, 84 women (6. 4 %) responded, nearly all by mail, whereas women account for 11 % of the mailing list. More than half hold positions where they make sure their Spore is put to wide use: in libraries, information centres and education, and leadership positions in some civil society groups. Where are you from? Of the six ACP regions, the most populous, West Africa, provided the most responses: 548, or 42 %. Here, Nigeria, followed by Benin and Togo, takes the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share.</b> The large population, and widespread distribution, in Nigeria combine in a readership level of almost six people in 10, 000, above the average. Another <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> is taken by Ethiopia, with a readership level of 5. 1 / 10, 000, due in part to widespread distribution amongst extension workers and Spore being one of the few English language publications available. Each country can take pride, or note, of the number of responses it returned, each with its special reasons. Some regions, such as the Caribbean, or sub-regions, are relatively well-catered for in agricultural publications. Other countries, such as South Africa or Zimbabwe, have emerging agricultural sectors which have yet to express their demand in full. The full picture of responses by country is shown in the large Table 1. How many are you? We estimate that there are at least 1, 089, 200 readers of Spore. Well over one million. This does not include the people who read articles taken from Spore and published in another newspaper, magazine or Website, or broadcast on radio or TV. We call those people secondary readers, and we cannot begin to calculate them. Primary readers are the people who touch their Spore (or someone else s), take it from a library shelf, receive a photocopy within their organisation, read it in a village centre, study it in their office, or listen to the words and study the pictures whilst it is read out in the hundreds of readers groups of which so many respondents have written to us. How do we calculate our readership? One survey question was how many people read your Spore? : for example, 149 respondents said that 5 people do, and 137 said that 50 or more do. We took all these replies; we excluded the clear errors and removed the fantastic (17, 000; 15, 000); we checked for evidence (many readers explained their own sums); and we rounded off. When someone wrote 5 we put 5, and about 10 or more than 10 became 11, because we added 10 %. In all, 1, 241 respondents answered this question (73 did not). The total number of readers for those 1, 241 was 33, 786. On average this means 27. 23 readers per copy. We multiplied this average by the estimated number of copies of Spore which are read each issue: 40, 000. And 40, 000 times 27. 23 = 1, 089, 200. And the 40, 000 copies? Well, at the time of our analysis, the Spore mailing list had 11, 703 institutions and 21, 442 individuals. Of these 33, 145 copies, most go to subscribers in ACP countries (30, 713). Others go to paying subscribers, some complimentary copies go to partner organisations, our correspondents in ACP countries, and the mass media. The delegations of the European Union in ACP countries, who operate their own mailing lists, receive 4, 200 copies. To this total of 37, 345, we added the 2, 750 copies which are distributed at seminars, study visits, fairs and conferences. We then rounded the total down to 40, 000. In addition, the World Wide Web editions have a growing readership. In June 2002, the Spore pages were being read by 14, 640 visitors each two months (the frequency of Spore). When you study Table 1, remember that what matters most is not the actual total, but how many copies of Spore are available to, amongst others, rural people in a country. All in all, Table 1 has enough data to make a great many calculations. We invite you to send us your ideas on how to expand Spore s outreach. Most of the 1, 314 responses were received by mail. Many were typed, or in computer files. More than half were eloquent hand-written texts with some, in good Spore reader tradition, extending to several pages.

40|$|Entrepreneurship {{is seen as}} {{a crucial}} {{determinant}} of economic development. Entrepreneurs recognize and capitalize on opportunities so that a business organization can be created and evolve. The ability and willingness of entrepreneurs to take risks and start new companies, coupled with institutions that support entrepreneurship, has sparked economic growth and job creation. But it is not small firms per se that are the key; it is the relatively small number of fast-growing gazelles that account for the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of net new jobs in small firms. In a quickly changing economy with a premium on innovation, {{the degree to which the}} economy is composed of new, rapidly growing firms is said to be indicative of innovative capacity. These enterprises often start in the home region of the entrepreneur, but when they grow they have to reconsider their location. Do they stay in their region of origin or do they move to or start branches in other regions and countries? The general purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises. A critical overview of theories on location and on the development of new enterprises shows that there is indeed a gap to be filled. This gap concerns a life course approach to the analysis of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, including the role of networks and the role of the entrepreneur. A comprehensive theory of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises is still lacking. There are theories on the growth of new enterprises, but these have no spatial dimension and do not explain their spatial organization. And there are also theories on multinational enterprises, but these mainly focus on large, well-established enterprises. In addition, there are empirical approaches to the location decisions of small firms, but most of them lack a proper theory. To fill this gap we have made use of existing approaches that had not previously been related to research into the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, but which offered promising applications. However, as explained below, the spatial organization of enterprises as such refers to a state, but this state has to be explained by an underlying process. Understanding dynamics of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises involves the study of entrepreneurship in context. Although empirical and theoretical issues of this kind of research have been discussed quite intensively, there has been remarkably little discussion about meta-theoretical issues. While it is clear that positivism has died a long time ago that does not mean that we have to embrace the postmodern anything goes-principle. Our study is based on a post-positivist constructive realism. This will be discussed together with other meta-theoretical foundations of research on entrepreneurship in context. To fulfil the purpose of this study a confrontation between theory and particular empirical settings is considered. An empirical inquiry into the impact of both inter-organizational and personal - networks on the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, which is essentially about entrepreneurial behaviour, needs a research approach that takes into account cognitive, affective, and behavioural elements. These elements have been investigated in empirical research into the (location) strategies and histories of evolving enterprises in two young - knowledge services, and biomedicals and two mature industries - shipbuilding, and graphics-media, in contrasting regions (core/urbanized, peripheral/rural) ...|$|E
40|$|Some 3 million {{small-scale}} {{farmers in}} a dozen African countries grow cashew (Anacardium occidentale) for a world market that is constantly expanding (+ 6 % per year). Rich in dietetic properties, the fruit of this savannah tree, known as the cashew nut, has long been sought after in industrialised countries, and has more recently become popular in China. International trade, which accounts for barely one-fifth of global output estimated at 2. 3 Mt in 2005, is expected to keep on growing. This rising demand represents an opportunity for African countries, six of which feature {{in the list of}} the world s 10 biggest cashew producers (in descending order, Nigeria, Tanzania, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and Benin). But their output is dwarfed by that of India, Brazil and most notably Vietnam, which alone accounts for almost one-third of world production. Close to Europe, with a plentiful supply of cheap labour and a quality of cashew nut that is highly prized by consumers, Africa has some distinct advantages. But so far it has failed to exploit this potential to the full. Africa exports 90 % of its cashew nuts unprocessed to India, which shells them before re-exporting them, toasted or processed, to the EU and the United States. As a result, Africa misses out on the <b>lion</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of the added value component. A new strategy But this circuit, set in place after the dismantling of state marketing systems, is now undergoing a marked shift. This is partly because the Indians are now more inclined to shell the nuts at the point of production, due to rising costs of oil and transport. Furthermore, new EU sanitary standards introduced in 2005 force them {{to pay more attention to}} the quality of their product to avoid losing clients. European importers do not want the risk of sanctions if a batch turns out to be dangerous to consumer health. Traceability requirements dictate that every link in the chain between the field where the cashew was grown and the very last retailer must, in the event of a problem, be able to identify the exact provenance of the product that he sold, processed or packed. The final responsibility, however, lies with the importer. The change in strategy adopted by Indian buyers first started 2 years ago. In 2004 and 2005, Olam International, a group which markets a quarter of the world s cashew production, opened processing factories in Côte d'Ivoire and Nigeria. Similar initiatives are being launched in Ghana and Guinea Bissau. In Tanzania, the same group has opened a processing plant in partnership with the US NGO Technoserve. In Mozambique, an agreement stipulates that the Indians will supply finance and technology to rebuild the industry, which ran into problems during the 1990 s. Processing in Africa Donors and governments are now unanimous in their desire for cashew processing to be carried out in Africa, seeing it as a way of reducing poverty and creating employment. Shelling is generally done by hand, mostly by women. Since 2000, a number of in-depth studies have examined the promising African sector. National programmes offer support to small and medium-scale producers throughout the production chain. For example, Benin, which is looking to the cashew sector as a partial substitute for cotton, is starting to train its farmers. A guarantee fund helps processors obtain loans from microfinance institutions. Six small shelling units have been opened since 2003. At regional level, Trade Expansion in Cashew Nuts from Africa, a project mainly financed by the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to build a network of all the players in the sector so as to develop a direct export line of unprocessed and processed cashew nuts to both industrialised countries and the regional market. Shelling in Africa does not pose any major technical problems. There are a number of small industrial processing units whose services are relatively affordable. So although it is a delicate process, shelling by hand produces good results, enabling the nut to be released unbroken from its shell, thereby ensuring the quality of the product. The technique also allows the careful collection of the precious cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), a fluid that irritates the skin but which is used in the paint and lubricant industries. A sector ripe for investment Studies show that, if well managed, factories run by associations, local cooperatives and small and medium-scale private business operators can prove viable in Africa, and produce good quality cashew nuts. In the early stages, one major problem is financing stocks during the 2 -month harvest period so as to keep the factories working all-year round. Grouping producers together is also vital in order to carry out marketing campaigns and increase bargaining power. New investors face competition from well-established firms which are able to call on solid networks for both supplies and marketing. Shelling is just the first step in the processing of the cashew nut, which can go on to be toasted, salted or used to make all sorts of conserves. Other parts of the cashew are also of value. Eaten fresh, the pseudo-fruit, known as the cashew apple, is rich in vitamin C and popular with local consumers. It can also be used to make juice, wine and jams. In Ghana, a brandy made from good quality cashew apple has been developed. But so far, none of these products has been promoted on the European or regional markets, even though the latter are thought to hold particular promise. The African cashew nut is at a turning point. New European sanitary standards coupled with high transport costs are encouraging a move towards home-grown shelling operations and helping to build an increasingly solid sector [...] ...|$|E

The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> declined 17. 9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> would have declined only 13. 9 percent.

40|$|Despite {{the early}} belief that persons with agrammatic aphasia have intact {{language}} comprehension, {{research in the}} fields of both linguistics and speech-language pathology has documented that these individuals often have difficultly comprehending certain sentence structures in English. Such core structures include those in which the standard subject-verbobject (SVO) English word order is violated. These deficits have been specifically noted in passive sentences (e. g., The tiger (O) was chased (V) by the <b>lion</b> (<b>S).),</b> object-relative clause constructions (e. g. It was the tiger (O) that the <b>lion</b> (<b>S)</b> chased (V)), and object-cleft constructions (e. g., The tiger (O) that the <b>lion</b> (<b>S)</b> chased (V) is big.). During the past thirty years, researchers have tried to find a theory to most parsimoniously describe these selective impairments in comprehension and their patterns in persons with agramatism. Attempts explain these comprehension deficits have mostly been within the realm of linguistic theory. To date, some of the most influential work has come from Grodzinsky (1986, 1990, 1995 a) who first accounted for the above findings by presenting a theory to explain the sentence comprehension difficulties, called the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (TDH). The TDH assumes that, in agrammatism, all traces of noun phrase (NP) movement are deleted from the surface structure representation of a sentence and, therefore, the moved NP lacks a theta role. As a result, a cognitive default strategy then assigns any NP lacking a theta role a default role according to its linear position in the sentence based on a “standard ” canonical order (Grodzinsky, 1995 a). This theory has faced multiple revisions (e. g., Hickok, Zurif, & Cansecogonzalez, 1993) and continues to confront challenges posed by recent published finding...|$|R

The proof is based on exploiting the propagation in time of the compactness of the solutions, i. e. the property that if we take a sequence of weak solution s which converges weakly and such that the corresponding initial conditions converge strongly, then the weak limit is also a solution...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 In June 1988 the Japanese {{agreed to}} liberalize their beef market {{which had been}} {{protected}} by an import quota system for twenty-four years. The purpose of this thesis is to draw conclusions/implications concerning {{the effect of the}} trade agreement (1988 Import Quota Removal Agreement) upon Japanese beef imports and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> in the market. The research encompassed a background study, a literature review, and an empirical demand analysis. The research yielded several conclusions. Firstly, it is not likely that the Japanese demand for beef will increase dramatically following quota removal. Secondly, the demand for imported beef is not likely to increase rapidly in the post-transition period. Thirdly, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> in the Japanese beef market, which saw steady growth during the 1980 s, may decline in the next several years...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{exports of}} industrialised {{countries}} in the 1996 - 2006 period. First, there is a short discussion {{of the theory of}} international trade and its recent theoretical developments. After that we have analysed the long-run development of the structure of Finnish exports, and its structure relative to that of other industrialised countries after 1996. The export structure of Sweden {{is by far the most}} similar with that of Finland. We also analysed Finland 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in the total exports of industrialised countries and Finland 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in the total exports in terms of its most important export products. Finland 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in total exports has declined a little, but within the group of 2 ̆ 01 cold industrialised countries 2 ̆ 01 d its share has remained unchanged. Using the Lafay index, we determine that Finland is strongly specialised in the exports of mobile phones and paper products. Furthermore, Finland is specialised in the exports of high-tech products as determined by the OECD. The share of mobile phones in these exports is 70 per cent, however. Finally, we have studied how the share of value added in the value of production in Finnish manufacturing sectors has changed between the 1970 s and 2005. On average the ratio has remained relatively stable, but during the past few years it has declined somewhat. There are significant differences between the manufacturing sectors in this respect...|$|R

The size of the dissenting widow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> differs among the several states, but the normal range is from one third to one half of her husband 2 ̆ 7 s net estate. In some jurisdictions the widow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> is determined, {{in whole or in}} part, according to the portion to which she would be entitled if her husband had died intestate, but in these jurisdictions the widow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> generally cannot exceed a specified percentage of the estate. The property of the decedent that is subject to the widow 2 ̆ 7 s dissent is described by such terms as 2 ̆ 2 the net estate, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 the surplus after payment of debts, 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 remainder of the personal property. 2 ̆ 2 Whatever language is employed, the thrust of the statutory provisions is to protect a widow by giving her an election to take, in lieu of her husband 2 ̆ 7 s testamentary gifts, a specified share of his real and personal property remaining after payment of funeral expenses, administrative expenses, and other claims against the estate...|$|R

Higher R&D and human capital intensities are associated with high U. <b>S.</b> <b>shares</b> in exports and, more strongly with high U. <b>S.</b> multinationals' <b>shares,</b> and higher labor content with low shares. Within the multinationals, high R&D intensity leads to {{a larger share of}} the firms' exports being supplied from the U. S. parent. The higher the labor intensity and the level of advertising expenditures in an industry, the larger the proportion of the firms' exports supplied by the foreign affiliates.
