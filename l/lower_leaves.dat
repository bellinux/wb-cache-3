5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or <b>lower</b> <b>leaves,</b> suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the hairiness is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E

25|$|In {{the state}} of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as {{boundary}} markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> for barbacoa or destroying them completely {{to look for the}} edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.|$|E
25|$|Gillenia (syn. Porteranthus) is a genus of {{two species}} of {{perennial}} herbs in the Rosaceae family. Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, Indian-physic, American ipecac. This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America. Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> are divided into palmately arranged leaflets. Plants bloom in May, June, or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp {{as if they were}} wilted. The flowers mature into small capsules. These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used in herbal medicine.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous photosynthesising plant, emerging {{in spring and}} retreating underground in the autumn. It has slender carrot-shaped roots which are directed downwards. The leaves are alternately set along the stems and have an outline of 5–11½×8–17cm. The <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> are usually composed of three sets of three entire or sometimes bifid leaflets, and occasionally there is third order division, resulting in a maximum of nineteen leaflets. The shape of the leaflets is wide to narrowly oval, with the largest width at midlength or towards the tip. The base of the leaflets {{is more or less}} wedge-shaped or sometimes rounded, the margin is entire and sometimes wavy, and the tip is rounded or has a smaller or larger sharp tip. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless, while the undersides are hairless or sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs. The hermaphrodite flowers are set individually {{at the end of the}} stems and are subtended by none to two leafy bracts. The flower itself consists of two or three green sepals, five to eight petals, that may be white, pale yellow, yellow, yellow with a red blotch at the base or with a reddish margin, pink, red, or purple-red, and many stamens consisting of pale, yellow, pink or purple filaments topped by anthers that contain yellow pollen. At the very centre of each flower are one to five carpels that are glabrous, sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs and almost directly tipped by the stigmas which are mostly curved or S-shaped from above.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of foreign dramas, movies, cartoons, news and documentaries, the {{localization}} voice-over requires more exact timing in relation to what appears on the screen. In order to perform voice-overs, {{the volume of the}} original language voice track is <b>lowered,</b> <b>leaving</b> only a faint sound remaining or, in some cases, no sound at all except for the music-and-effects tracks. Voice-over work is primarily performed for news and original foreign dramas. Auditions are held in order to determine who will take on the roles.|$|R
5000|$|In both genera, the <b>lower</b> cauline <b>leaves</b> are pseudosessile, {{which means}} that the {{petioles}} are adnate to the stems. The upper cauline leaves, if present, are truly sessile.|$|R
25|$|It's often {{recommended}} that A.sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without burning the leaves. The choice of growing {{the plant in}} intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect {{the timing of the}} flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production {{it is important that the}} light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf-pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for 2 to 4 years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or large pot is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed.|$|E
500|$|The {{upside-down}} flower spikes drip nectar {{onto the}} ground or <b>lower</b> <b>leaves,</b> suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals which are attracted to the scent. Supporting this hypothesis, the spiky leaves seem to also prevent access to foragers not at ground level.

500|$|The parsnip is a {{biennial}} {{plant with}} a rosette of roughly hairy leaves {{that has a}} pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to [...] long.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, a new stitch {{is passed}} through a single {{unsecured}} ('active') loop, thus lengthening that wale by one stitch. [...] However, this need not be so; the new loop may be {{passed through a}}n already secured stitch lower down on the fabric, or even between secured stitches (a dip stitch). [...] Depending on the distance between where the loop is drawn through the fabric {{and where it is}} knitted, dip stitches can produce a subtle stippling or long lines {{across the surface of the}} fabric, e.g., the <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> of a flower. [...] The new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the 'present' row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric. [...] The new loop may also be passed through 'two or more' previous stitches, producing a decrease and merging wales together. [...] The merged stitches need not be from the same row; for example, a tuck can be formed by knitting stitches together from two different rows, producing a raised horizontal welt on the fabric.|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{difference}} of ozone (O- 3) sensitivity of photosynthesis in leaves located different canopy positions, we investigated photosynthetic responses of Japanese oak saplings to free air O- 3 exposure, and compared the results with Siebold's beech saplings reported previously. The O- 3 at 60 nmol mol(- 1) during daytime was fumigated for two growing seasons, from 6 August to 11 November 2011 and from 17 May to 10 November 2012. In June, August and October of 2012, we determined photosynthetic activity of upper and <b>lower</b> canopy <b>leaves.</b> The exposure to O- 3 increased the ratio of intercellular CO 2 concentration to ambient CO 2 concentration in October, indicating stomatal sluggishness. We observed an O- 3 -induced, significant decrease in light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (A(sat)) with no significant interaction between O- 3 effect and canopy position for A(sat). Therefore, we conclude that the O- 3 sensitivity of photosynthesis in upper and <b>lower</b> canopy <b>leaves</b> was similar in Japanese oak, while our previous study reported that the upper canopy leaves of Siebold's beech have a higher O- 3 sensitivity than <b>lower</b> canopy <b>leaves...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Like all thrips of {{suborder}} Terebrantia, S. dorsalis undergoes two nymphal stages {{followed by}} two [...] "false" [...] pupal stages, and under optimal conditions, this thrips may reach adulthood in approximately two weeks. However, {{research has shown that}} the length of these life-history stages are flexible within a group depending on an individual's access to nutrients and temperature. Nymphs entering the metamorphic process drop off of the plant during the first of two propual stages, and then complete their development in loose soil or leaf litter at the base of their host - but have been observed to pupate in any dark and humid crevice low on the plant, including bark and the folds of tightly packed <b>lower</b> <b>leaves</b> or flowers. The pupal process can range from two days to a full week. In temperate regions where the temperature falls below the critical lower threshold, non-diapausing adults are reported to overwinter in the soil or apical buds. Colder temperatures may even drive pupation, but this has not been experimentally confirmed.|$|E
