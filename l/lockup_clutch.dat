5000|$|In 2005 Jeep {{replaced}} the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer {{case with the}} NV245 transfer case. This transfer case actually has a center differential, allowing both {{the front and rear}} axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement. The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear. There is also an electronically controlled variable <b>lockup</b> <b>clutch</b> pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential. This is the improvement over the Selec-Trac NV242 transfer case, as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them. And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act {{in the same manner as}} in the NV247 transfer case above.|$|E
50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The hydrodynamic power transmission is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the pump brake being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the turbine gear due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the input clutch opens and the <b>lockup</b> <b>clutch,</b> is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer rim of the locked up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, most Torqueflite {{transmissions}} {{gained a}} <b>lockup</b> torque converter <b>clutch</b> to mechanically connect the converter's impeller and turbine, eliminating slip for better highway fuel economy. This addition required {{the removal of}} the torque converter drain plug.|$|R
50|$|Typically with {{motorcycles}} and {{in motor}} sport, the clutch {{is often used}} to facilitate the use of resistance from the engine spinning at high speeds to decelerate the vehicle more quickly, often accompanied with normal braking. This can be achieved by placing the vehicle in a gear that would ordinarily be too low for the current speed and momentum of the vehicle and by partly engaging the clutch. When this happens momentum energy from the inertia of the vehicle is taken away to spin the engine {{as close as possible to}} its maximum capability. As the vehicle is decelerating the clutch can be further released to transfer more energy to keep the engine spinning as quickly as possible. This method causes excessive clutch wear however, and it could cause severe engine damage or wheel <b>lockup</b> if the <b>clutch</b> were released suddenly.|$|R
40|$|Equivalence Checker), an {{algorithm}} and tool {{to perform}} auto-matic and compositional equivalence checking of C code against Simulink models. Such equivalence checking {{is important in}} model based development of safety-critical control software in industrial settings, where either the Simulink models are hand-generated to correspond to existing legacy code bases, or the C code is generated from Simulink models using code generators. In the former case, the manual translations may not preserve behavior; in the latter case, equivalence checking is necessary {{to ensure that the}} code generator has not introduced bugs if the code generator itself is not certified. CSEC compo-sitionally constructs proofs of equivalence of two call graphs, by constructing a formula that is valid iff two functions are equivalent, when all called functions are assumed equivalent. The validity of the formula is checked using an SMT solver. We have applied CSEC to a module of powertrain controller C code base and the corresponding semi-automatically translated Simulink model at Toyota, and have automatically uncovered several dissimilar behaviors between models and code. We have also applied CSEC to prove equivalence of a <b>Clutch</b> <b>Lockup</b> Model and the automatically generated C code from the model. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} wet clutch torque {{transmission}} characteristics {{is a problem}} of both theoretical and practical interest. In this dissertation, the topic is examined from two parallel viewpoints; the fundamental approach involves detailed dynamic modeling of the contacting surfaces, while the applied approach includes a computationally efficient model for the gross features of clutch engagement. The model for torque transfer is validated with experimental data from the Wet Clutch Dynamic Test Rig. ^ The torque transfer model accurately predicts wet clutch engagement performance over a wide range of input parameters. The results demonstrate the importance of accurately determining such parameters as friction material permeability, applied force, and friction coefficient. It is shown that the success of the predictions is closely related to the precise characterization of the friction coefficient. ^ The fundamental study involves the interaction of velocity-dependent friction coefficient and time-varying normal forces. A new type of friction-related dynamic instability is predicted using a perturbation analysis, and simulation results are presented to corroborate the predictions. A finite element model of the contact is developed, and stick-slip before <b>lockup</b> of the <b>clutch</b> disks is shown to produce torque oscillations under non-constant normal forces. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{priority}} for lubricant performance for metal V-belt-type CVT (B-CVTFs) {{should be the}} improvement of transmittable torque capacity between the belt and pulley plus excellent antishudder properties for <b>lockup</b> <b>clutch</b> used in B-CVTs. This study intends to investigate the effect of lubricant additives for improving these performances of B-CVTs. In addition, surface analysis techniques were utilized to gain a novel insight into the chemical composites and morphology of the tribofilms. As a result, it is vital for greater torque capacity to give higher boundary friction coefficient between the metal contacting interfaces, {{and the process of}} boundary lubricant film formation derived from antiwear additives used in B-CVTFs strongly impacts on the torque capacity. Moreover, it is found that a sort of lubricant formulation gave an excellent antishudder performance for wet clutch with keeping higher friction coefficient between the metals, which would result in improving the performance of B-CVTs...|$|E
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as shifting device or <b>lockup</b> <b>clutch.</b> As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are applicable for heavy duty vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a friction generating machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.
