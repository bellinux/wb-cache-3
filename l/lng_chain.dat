40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{continually}} expanding demand of natural gas worldwide, the LNG industry is undergoing significant changes in its trade structure and shipping characteristics. The growth in LNG trade will continue and with it the growth of the LNG shipping industry. Departing from the rigid structure of the traditional LNG trade, the introduction of trade flexibility through development of short-term contracts and spot trading is altering the picture in LNG shipping. In the current work, the evolution and future of LNG trade as a share of the natural gas trade is presented and analysed, with respect to worldwide and regional (mainly European) supply and demand and its competition with other current (pipeline) and emerging natural gas transportation alternatives. Changes {{in the structure of the}} LNG trade, in <b>LNG</b> <b>chain</b> economics and LNG fleet characteristics are detected, correlated and assessed.

40|$|LNG, Competition and Security of Supply: the Role of Shipping - In {{the last}} few years, {{one of the main}} {{concerns}} of European Union in the energetic field has been that of facilitating the safeguard of raw materials’ security of supply, especially that of natural gas. Import through <b>LNG</b> <b>chain,</b> that is, through the employment of LNG tankers for gas transportation, has been identified by the European Council as one of the instruments to achieve these goals. In fact, import via LNG does not require, for the importer, such investments as to determine an indissoluble physical tie between producer and buyer, as happens for transport via pipeline (Chernyavs’ka et al., 2002). In other words, investments in pipelines are very specific. Moreover, as they are made in order to support specific transactions, contracts usually take the form of long-term agreements with minimum offtake requirements (take or pay clauses) : such contracts definitely contribute to the "cartelization" of the market, hindering competition. Unlike investments in pipelines, those in the <b>LNG</b> <b>chain</b> present a much lower degree of specificity: in fact, even though the construction of a regasification plant is generally tied to the stipulation of a long-term agreement (with take or pay clause), <b>LNG</b> <b>chain</b> costs have significantly decreased over time (until a few years ago) and, moreover, it is getting increasingly common that part of plant capacity is made available for spot transactions. What’s more, once the contract is expired and the investment is sunk, the importer may satisfy his gas supply needs {{on the basis of his}} relative gains. As far as LNG import contractual practices are concerned, significant changes have started to take places in {{the last few}} years, both in terms of agreements’ length - average duration has significantly decreased - and in terms of price indexation - in the most developed markets LNG price is tied to gas spot price (IEA, 2006). One of the many possible advantages of transport via LNG is that liquefied gas enables European importers to widen their gas suppliers portfolio. Increased possibilities of choice for importers, the widening of the group of exporting countries, and the increased integration of the European market, thanks to the possibility of redirecting cargoes depending on single countries’ supply-demand balance, would contribute decisively to security of supply, market globalization and competition (between importers) in the industry (IEA, 2004). Yet, it must be stressed that import via tanker appears to be competitive with import via pipe only for the medium-long distances. As far as <b>LNG</b> <b>chain</b> is concerned, the element that so far has attracted the least attention, though being not less important than the other two, is certainly shipping. Being the link between the producing/exporting country and the importing country, and having been subject to major changes in the last few years, it is particularly interesting to analyze it singularly, aiming to understand how it is linked to the other elements of LNG value chain, besides studying industry dynamics. This paper will address this issue, aiming also to understand what has been and what will be in the future the evolutionary trajectory of this segment, starting from an analysis of operative and planned gas tankers, their size, their routes and their contractual situation. This analysis can be useful to make hypothesis about the growth of the spot market and, consequently, of market liquidity.

LNG is stored and transported in tanks as a cryogenic liquid, i. e. as a liquid at a temperature below its boiling point at near atmospheric pressure.

The objective is to maximize expected discounted profits through optimal investments in infrastructure. A dataset based {{on a set of}} potential fields on the Norwegian continental shelf, with shipping of LNG to three markets in the Atlantic basin, is used to solve the model. The results illustrate when FLNG units can add value to the value chain. They are used as a supplement to onshore processing plants; for example expanding peak capacity or to react to the resolution of uncertain parameters. The floating liquefaction option is especially attractive for fields located far from shore. We also find that the main reason for using FLNG units is their lower liquefaction costs, not the ability to move between fields. The stochastic version of the model results in solutions very similar to the solutions of the deterministic model, even though it is significantly harder to solve.

The liquefied natural gas is then transported in shipping vessels which are affected by the extreme weather conditions found in Arctic; during the winter and spring: sea ice, icebergs, low temperatures, and complete darkness, and for the summer and fall: fog, waves and mammal migrations.

40|$|Due to its {{environmental}} attributes, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a clean fossil fuel {{source of energy}} has witnessed a steady increase in demand worldwide over the last decade. This increase is mainly attributed to higher demand from the power generation sector {{as well as from}} domestic and industrial usages. This growing role of LNG among competing energy sources has raised concerns over the safety and security of the <b>LNG</b> <b>chain</b> of production, transport and distribution and its related infrastructure. Within this context, LNG ports and marine terminals, being strategically located at the midstream of the LNG Supply Chain (SC), are further exposed to safety and security risks and represent credible targets for international terrorism. Ensuring uninterrupted, robust and resilient LNG SC requires first, adequate management of safety and security risks in LNG ports and marine terminals. While each discipline of risk, be it safety or security, has received significant attention both in theory and practice, less attention was given to the management of interfaces and shared impacts among LNG Ports safety and security risks which led to the existence of gaps in the risk management (RM) systems of LNG ports and may represent a major source of risk and disruption to LNG ports. This research addresses such gaps which are poorly addressed in the current literature and proposes a holistic and integrated approach to the issues of LNG ports safety and security risks assessment and management. It also aims to model safety and security RM from a SC perspective and examines the relationships and shared impacts among LNG ports safety and security risks in the present context of increased LNG demand worldwide in the post 9 / 11 terrorism era. A unique combination of multiple methods within port and maritime SCs, including a Delphi survey, quantitative survey, Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and a focus group expert consultation, is applied to reformulate the prevailing RM approach marked by dichotomy and a disciplinary silo and to propose a more enhanced and holistic approach to safety and security RM. The results of the study confirm that an integrated and holistic approach to the issue of RM in LNG ports and marine terminals is necessary to cost-effectively address safety and security risks and ensure reliable and resilient LNG SCs. Furthermore, a practical framework, {{in the form of a}} conceptual model, for LNG ports risks and emergencies management is proposed which integrates all facets of safety and security risks and emergencies management, including risk prevention, mitigation, emergency planning and response and port business continuity. The proposed conceptual model shows how the proposed RM approach can be practically applied in the context of LNG ports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as well as in any LNG port worldwide which lacks an integrated approach to risks and emergencies management.

40|$|Cet article rappelle tout d'abord, un constat du XVe Congrès du Conseil Mondial de l'Énergie (Madrid, septembre 1992) : au cours des 30 prochaines années, les énergies fossiles vont continuer à être à la base de tout approvisionnement énergétique. Examinant les {{conditions}} de ce maintien dans un contexte géopolitique difficile, il montre qu'une des voies à privilégier est d'accroître les efforts de recherches pour réaliser les progrès scientifiques et technologiques qui permettront de satisfaire {{la demande}} en pétrole et en gaz pour le début du 21 ème siècle. L'effort de R & D nécessaire pour disposer des technologies pétrolières et gazières de la prochaine décennie nécessite une recherche faite en commun, car seule une recherche coordonnée évitera une dispersion des efforts français. L'élargissement des réserves économiquement exploitables, la maîtrise du coût de production et la réduction des coûts des chaînes gaz des champs de production aux régions consommatrices, tout en assurant la protection de l'environnement sont les prochains défis à relever. Pour faire face à ces attentes de l'industrie, d'importants efforts de recherche doivent être menés dans les domaines scientifiques correspondants, afin de mieux appréhender les phénomènes et de développer les solutions les plus appropriées. En définitive, les progrès scientifiques et technologiques, nécessaires à l'élargissement des réserves économiques exploitables, à une plus grande accessibilité aux ressources pétrolières et gazières, ainsi qu'à une utilisation mieux ciblée de l'énergie face à la protection de l'environnement, demandent un accroissement sensible des efforts de recherche. Une telle politique ne peut se concevoir sans recourir à un partenariat plus large et sans une incitation et un financement substantiel de la part de la puissance publique, française ou européenne. This article begins by recalling a statement {{made at the}} 15 th World Energy Council (Madrid, September 1992) : during the next 30 years, fossil energy sources {{will continue to be}} the basis for all energy supplies. By looking at the conditions of this assertion within a difficult geopolitical context, it shows that one of the privileged routes is to increase research efforts to make scientific and technological advances that will make it possible to fulfill the demand for oil and gas {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. The R&D effort required to make oil and gas technologies available for the next decade calls for concerted research to be done, for only coordinated research will prevent the dispersal of French efforts (Fig. 6). Increasing economically exploitable reserves, mastering production costs and reducing the costs of gas chainsfrom producing fields to consumer regions, while ensuring environmental production, are the challenges that have to be faced. To cope with these expectations for the industry, great research efforts must be made in the corresponding scientific areas so as to gain a better understanding of phenomena and to develop the most suitable solutions (Fig. 7). The leading R&D axes to be promoted between now and 2000 are then explained. Reducing exploration risks requires, above all, a better petroleum assessment of basins. The progress expected will be based on the scaling up of 2 D basin modeling to 3 D modeling for assessing the ultimate reserves of a basin (Fig. 8 and Plate I). Improving the determining of the geometry of subsurface geologic structures will benefit from progress in structural imaging, whose aim is to obtain an assessment of the position and shape of seismic reflectors. These are geologic concepts (the understanding the geologist has of the architecture of deltaic or alluvial deposits, of different types of reefs, etc.) which, based on geostatistics and expressed by numerical modeling, will make lithological interpolation among wells (Fig. 9 and Plate II), thus leading to the better characterization of reservoirs. In structures where there is already a good understanding of the formations, the progress expected for the years to come, thanks to geophysical techniques, will involve prestack inversion, which will ascertain important characteristics such as the presence of gas or even the distinction of two fluids as well as the obtaining of three-dimensional data. Concerning production from fields, the stakes for R&D are considerable since the problem is now to produce from the great majority of small and structurally complex fields, or even, in some countries, to resume production from fields hampered by a relatively rustic recovery method. Such undertakings are essentially based on a better understanding of reservoir dynamics. On line of reflection that is certainly important for the future will be to analyze behavior laws in complex cases. In this area as well, numerical modeling is what will synthesize all the data (Plate V). After the reservoir has been characterized and the production method decided upon, it is indispensable to ascertain the most effective ways of operating. In this area, the technical mastery sought after aims to reduce the cost-to-quantities produced ratio while ensuring environmental protection, for example such as replacing oil-base driling fluids by nonpolluting fluids. Achieving optimum production at less cost will require better use of the processing capacities already in place. This will be achieved by the development of multiphase production, in particular for marginal or deep offshore fields. Concerning new production systems and within a context in which oil companies are seeking to exploit marginal fields and deep-water discoveries under the best possible economic conditions, the Nomad project (Plate VI) for multiphase evacuation via a light floating support seems to be destined for a great future. To decrease costs, another alternative is to use automated and unmanned installations. Gas transportation often entails the constraint of exorbitant costs, thus compromising the competitivity of gas projects. This is especially the case for the international transport of natural gas in the form of LNG, which will expand in the most competitive markets only if decisive technological progress is achieved so as to bring about a substantial decrease in costs throughout the entire <b>LNG</b> <b>chain.</b> Lastly, the chemical conversion of natural gas into fuels or petrochemical base stocks may be considered as an alternative solution to liquefaction for production from gas fields very far away from the consumer markets. For both economic and environmental reasons, natural gas appears to be the best possible base stock for manufacturing synthetic fuels. All in all, scientific and technological progress required for the increasing of economically exploitable reserves, for gaining greater accessibility to oil and gas resources, and to better target use of energy in the face of environmental production, require an appreciable increase in research efforts. Such a policy is inconcevable without having recourse to more widespread partnership and without incentives and substantial financing by both French and European public authorities...|$|E
40|$|The term 'floating LNG' now covers {{both the}} {{liquefaction}} (FLNG) and import terminal (FSRU) {{parts of the}} <b>LNG</b> value <b>chain.</b> Over the past 10 years, 18 fl oating storage and regasifi cation units (FSRUs) have been installed and could now {{be regarded as the}} import terminal of choice as they offer a quick and flexible way of delivering LNG into a new gas market.

40|$|A global {{liquefied}} {{natural gas}} (LNG) market is quickly emerging, with several significant development projects very recently completed or underway; these projects consist of extraction, liquefaction, shipping, regasification, and storage facilities. Exact valuation of the real option to store LNG at the downstream terminal of an <b>LNG</b> value <b>chain</b> is computationally intractable. Thus, we develop a novel and tractable model for the heuristic valuation of this real option. This model uses a shipping model to represent upstream LNG production and shipping to the downstream regasification facility; a reduced form model {{of the evolution of}} the spot price in the wholesale natural gas market where regasified LNG is sold; a stochastic dynamic programming model to determine a policy for inventory control at the storage facility and sale into this market; and a final Monte Carlo simulation step to estimate the value of this policy. The basestock type structure that we prove for our model 2 ̆ 7 s LNG inventory release policy is central to make the final simulation step computationally efficient; this makes our model practical. We incorporate real and estimated data to quantify the value of the real option to store LNG at a regasification terminal, the dependence of this value on the level of stochastic variability in the shipping model and the type of natural gas price model used, and the relative value of this option for different parties involved in an <b>LNG</b> value <b>chain.</b> We also develop an upper bound, based on sample path optimization, to assess the effectiveness of our heuristic and find that our method is highly accurate. Our model {{has the potential to be}} used to value the real option to store other commodities in storage facilities located downstream of a commodity production or transportation stage, or the real option to store the input used in the production of a commodity...|$|R
30|$|Examples of {{operational}} {{drivers are}} described in, for example, Mattila (2013), who {{asserts that the}} <b>LNG</b> supply <b>chain</b> is more expensive than that for oil, especially in the start-up phase when volumes are inevitably small. Stipa (2013) also dwells on the better availability of alternative fuels other than LNG. In relation to cost drivers, Maloni et al. (2013) identify extra-slow steaming as the most beneficial vessel speed, yielding a 20  % reduction in total costs and a 43  % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Sources investigating regulatory drivers include Greenship (2013), who deals with emission abatement options given pending regulation; Johnsen (2013), who details the Norwegian NOx fund; Zheng et al. (2013), who conclude that EEDI has profound impacts not only China as a shipbuilding nation, but on shipbuilding countries around the world; and Hoffmann et al. (2012), who observe that a measure-by-measure approach yields a 5  % decrease in CO 2 emission per 1  % increase in capital expenditure, while the set-of-measures approach yields a 2  % emissions decrease per 1  % cost increase.|$|R
