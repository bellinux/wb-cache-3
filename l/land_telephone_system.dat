50|$|Mobile radio <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> of {{wireless}} type {{that preceded the}} modern cellular mobile form of telephony technology.

Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or manual), Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (AMTS) systems.These early mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service {{that was part of the}} public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system.|$|R

5000|$|TAPI is used {{primarily}} to control either modems or, more recently, to control business <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> (PBX) handsets. When controlling a PBX handset, {{the driver is}} provided by the manufacturer of the <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> Some manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of multiple handsets. This is traditionally called [...] "third-party control". Other manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of a single handset. This is called [...] "first-party control". Third-party drivers are designed to allow applications to see and/or control multiple extensions at the same time. Some <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> only permit one third-party connection at a time. First-party drivers are designed to allow applications to monitor and/or control one extension at a time. <b>Telephone</b> <b>systems</b> naturally permit many of these connections simultaneously.
