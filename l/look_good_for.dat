5|$|The French, who {{had started}} {{construction}} on Fort Carillon in 1755, {{used it as a}} launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France's governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain's Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.|$|E
500|$|However, Becky and Steve {{decide to}} adopt, in a storyline which was {{originally}} meant for Liz McDonald (Bev Callard). It {{was revealed that}} Becky was given the storyline because producer Kim Crowther was determined to feature such a plot. Becky does not like the idea at first thinking she would make a bad mother, later changing her mind. The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky, in real life Kelly was forced to reduce {{the length of her}} hair. This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline, which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers. Of this Kelly stated: [...] "With the adoption storyline, she borrows Claire Peacock's clothes for a while because she wants to <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the social worker coming round. We {{thought it was a good}} opportunity for her to have a slight image change." [...] Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding: [...] "I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} cast {{relatively unknown}} British actors for the series. Scottish actress Lindsay Duncan, who was cast as Servilia, {{believed that she}} and other UK actors [...] "can do old, can do classic, and you believe it." [...] She also said that because of long distances, [...] American actors or those of other nationalities were avoided: [...] "Transporting actors from [...] to Rome {{on a regular basis}} does not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the budget. We're quite cheap." [...] Stamp described Servilia as [...] "the great love of [...] Caesar's life, his mistress and by all counts the only woman he truly loved." [...] Irish actor Ciarán Hinds was cast as Caesar. Hinds first thought it was [...] "silly" [...] to be offered the part, but then [...] "you think it's quite an honour to be chosen to play it. And then you think, 'Oh shit I've got to do it', and then, well, 'I suppose someone has to do it!'" [...] Heller had believed that Hinds would make [...] "a great Caesar" [...] for a long time, and considered the series [...] "extremely lucky" [...] for being able to cast him.|$|E

[...] Eduardo M. Chavez's review on Whistle! Volume 1 noted that although it does not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> characters {{to run away from}} their problems, Sho's inner determination to play soccer is the main highlight of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{many people}} still {{supported}} Eagleton's candidacy, {{an increasing number of}} influential politicians and columnists questioned his ability to handle the office of Vice President. McGovern said he would back Eagleton “1000%”, and a Time magazine poll taken at the time found that 77 percent of the respondents said Eagleton's medical record would not affect their vote. Nonetheless, the press made frequent references to his 'shock therapy', and McGovern feared that this would detract from his campaign platform. The episode had placed McGovern in a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. [...] If he kept Eagleton, the selection did not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the decision-making ability of the McGovern team, while if he removed Eagleton, he appeared to be weak and vacillating.|$|E
2500|$|Gomez's {{appearance}} and portrayal were highlighted by some reviewers. Rap-Up {{called it the}} singer's most intimate video yet, while Idolator's Carl Williott called it [...] "understated". Alyssa Bailey of Elle said the clip was [...] "basically an instruction on how to be hot" [...] and proved [...] "power in vulnerability". Teen Vogue writer Casey Lewis said, [...] "But {{if she wants to}} <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> us, she certainly succeeds...Actually good is an understatement". According to Geller, Gomez was as involved in the clip's overall intimacy as Muller, and her portrayal was [...] "well-played". Geller lauded the visual as [...] "a masterpiece of suggestion", saying that although Gomez's shower scene was [...] "PG-13", it was [...] "still sexy enough to make any respectable fan's tongue hang out". Francesca Bacardi of E! said Gomez should permanently choose her [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] natural look sported in the clip.|$|E

2500|$|The storyline was set {{up during}} 1988, as Kathy found {{employment}} at James's wine bar, [...] "The Dagmar", causing friction between Kathy and her husband Pete who [...] "didn't like the pub, the clientele or the clothes Kathy felt she had to wear to <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> work". As James struggled with various personal and business issues simultaneously, he began to show an attraction to Kathy, leading to the storyline's eventual climax, Kathy's rape. Writer Colin Brake has commented that [...] "all the pieces [...] in place [...] Pete was away [...] Willmott-Brown asked Kathy to stay after work for a drink. The situation {{got out of hand}} and what began as seduction ended in rape." [...] The episodes covering the rape were written by Tony McHale and are considered by the writer Colin Brake as [...] "EastEnders at its best". Some 19 million viewers tuned in to see Kathy attacked in The Dagmar wine bar's upstairs flat, on 7 July 1988, in episode 357, reportedly 2 million more than the average viewership at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps {{women in a}} good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
