5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>The</b> Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2017, {{water was}} {{restored}} to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, and tints the water blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} steel frame {{structural}} systems allowed completely vertical construction; {{but as with}} many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers Building, the Palmolive Building, the LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.|$|E

5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the central tower, southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Tailors {{started to}} take {{premises}} around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tailors' working area {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

5000|$|Rev. Joseph [...] "Daddy" [...] Dunn (1746 - 1827) was an Englishman who {{was noted}} for his {{importing}} {{and distribution of}} gas throughout the United Kingdom, mainly the Preston area. Dunn rapidly changed the whole of Lancashire by transporting coal-gas <b>lighting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E
5|$|To {{help get}} the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters {{listed as a}} landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the {{original}} plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. The dining area was moved from the basement to street level in a space that was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and central plant systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later.|$|E

50|$|By 1906, the Corricks {{had ordered}} a {{portable}} electricity generator {{to provide them}} with improved stage and projection lighting. This also allowed them to lure a larger audience in country towns, as they would shine bright <b>lights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night sky, attracting curious customers from surrounding areas.|$|R
25|$|In the Mannerist {{period the}} “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif {{of a high}} {{semi-circular}} topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.|$|E
25|$|The centre {{only really}} came under larger {{development}} {{when it was}} purchased by the Universities Superannuation Scheme group in 1990. Thenceforth, a refurbishment program was undertaken, including the addition of large roof windows, which admitted more <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> centre. USS also created the Sherwood Square area and added the popular Frog Clock.|$|E
25|$|Sarriko station won the 1998 Brunel Award for Railway Design. It is noticeably {{different}} from the rest of the stations in the network: in place of the standard 'fosterito', a vast glazed atrium pours natural <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> entire station, and the long, unbroken escalator ride to the ticket hall from street level gives a dramatic sense of character to the station.|$|E

The two back houses each have a bay window to allow more <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground floor room. The lower floors to these houses have been divided by two spine walls. The upper floors are divided by one spine wall.|$|E
25|$|Genetic testing amongst {{randomly}} chosen Kurdish populations {{has begun}} to shed <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> disparate origins of the Kurds. The results reveal a variety of connections amongst the Kurds, when assessing paternal and maternal lineages. Overall the Kurds share some genetic ties to other speakers of Iranian languages {{as well as with}} various peoples from the Caucasus such as the Armenians which suggests that the Kurds have ancient ethnic ties that connect them to both the early inhabitants of the Kurdistan area, such as the Hurrians.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{was again}} cleaned and restored, {{starting with the}} west facade on Vanderbilt Avenue and gradually working counterclockwise. The project involved cleaning the facade, rooftop light courts, and statues; filling in cracks, repointing stones on the facade, restoring the copper roof and the building's cornice, repairing the large windows of the Main Concourse, and removing the remaining blackout paint applied to the windows during World War II. The result of the restoration, which was completed in 2007, was a cleaner, more attractive, and structurally sound exterior, and the windows now allow much more <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Main Concourse.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054nm in vaco) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing {{a considerable amount of}} energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the <b>light,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{cross-arm}} of {{the church}} contains the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a mullion which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful glass bricks. The red, green, yellow and blue glass bricks provide the only exterior <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with four bells that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized <b>light</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to use an optical {{condenser}} in an indirect light to reduce the heating, but without success. The entrance of electric <b>lights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> operating room in the 1880s was accompanied by problems. With early electrical technology control of the light emitted was poor. Electric light was still moving and diffuse, with great heat radiation.|$|R
