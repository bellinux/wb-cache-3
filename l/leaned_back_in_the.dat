60|$|And John Stumpy <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rocker in {{a defiant}} fashion.|$|E
60|$|Lady Honoria <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cab, {{and sighed}} {{a sigh of}} satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} a little pettishly as she <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cab.|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} persisted, were it but {{in hopes of}} his letting drop that which it {{concerned}} me to know, but he cut off further communication, by desiring me to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner and go to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nit," [...] she curtly replied; [...] "you rest up, and we'll go to-morrow night. We {{might take}} another turn {{and see the}} town by {{electric}} light; you could kind o' <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car and take it easy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Shaker tilting chair [...] {{named for}} its ball bearing or ball and socket button {{mechanism}} assembled to the back two legs of a wooden chair [...] allowed a person to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair without slipping or scraping the floor.|$|R
60|$|Anna {{gave her}} {{address to the}} driver. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cab with half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin, who had parted with Wolfenden with evident relief, <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cab {{and looked}} at his watch.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis {{crossed his}} legs and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Mr. Wadham {{remained}} upon the pavement, gazing {{for a moment at}} his empty hand.|$|E
60|$|They left London {{early the}} next morning and Eleanor, with a face that was almost haggard <b>leaned</b> wearily <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> train and {{scarcely}} spoke during the entire trip.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{chair and}} let her hands rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yacht, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured you? Or {{do you think that}} they, too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|R
60|$|Decresson and his {{companion}} exchanged glances. I <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> my chair. <b>The</b> {{three of them}} talked together earnestly for several minutes in an undertone. Then Louis, with a little sigh of relief, {{rose to his feet}} and came over to my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Mr. Halleck. Don't mention it," [...] {{said the}} policeman, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hack {{with an air}} of luxury, as it rumbled softly away.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{was moved}} by his father's unwonted warmth, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{carriage}} in silence. Theodora watched him anxiously, and did not speak for some time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether {{it will do}} {{any good}} or not remains to be seen," [...] and Dick gave a long-drawn sigh and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{sleeping}} car seat he occupied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very often. He {{has to work}} hard." [...] Burton <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his seat. <b>The</b> {{music of}} life seemed {{suddenly}} to be playing afar off--so far that he could only dimly catch the strains. The wind, too, must have changed--the perfume of the roses reached him no more.|$|R
60|$|He {{was shown}} {{into the library}} and left alone for nearly twenty minutes. Then Wilhelmina came, languid, and moving as though with tired feet. Yet her manner was gentler and kinder than usual. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> vast easy-chairs, and murmured a few graceful words of sympathy.|$|R
60|$|Teresa <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a corner. <b>The</b> {{whole way}} Harry could {{perceive}} her tears to flow under her veil; but she vouchsafed no explanation. At {{the door of}} <b>the</b> house <b>in</b> Queen Square, both alighted; and the cabman lowered the box, which Harry, glad to display his strength, received upon his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The negro had not disarranged {{the boat}} in the least, so they were soon on their way, Shep and Giant taking the oars. Snap <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern and {{stretched}} himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've made {{a flying}} start and no mistake," [...] was Randy's comment, as he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{cushioned}} seat. [...] "Two days ago we {{never dreamed of}} going to Alaska or anywhere else." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anna <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{chair and}} laughed softly. Even {{this man had}} {{accepted}} her for [...] "Alcide" [...] without a moment's question. Then all the embarrassments of the matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly grave.|$|E
60|$|The two charges left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gun {{were all}} that stood between him and eternity. With a desperate display of {{strength}} Jones threw his weight in a backward pull, and hauled Kentuck up. Then he <b>leaned</b> far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saddle, and shoved the Colts out beyond the horse's flank. Down went the broad head, with its black, glistening horns. Bang! She slid forward with a crash, plowing the ground with hoofs and nose--spouted blood, uttered a hoarse cry, kicked and died.|$|R
60|$|Laverick {{folded up}} <b>the</b> paper and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. <b>The</b> {{strain of the}} last twenty-four hours was {{beginning}} to tell even upon his robust constitution. The atmosphere of the room, too, was close. He <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and was suddenly weary. Perhaps he dozed. At any rate, the whisper which called him back to realization of where he was, came to him so unexpectedly that he sat up with a sudden start.|$|R
60|$|He was no coward, {{but he gave}} {{a little}} shudder as he {{examined}} the thing, and felt its blueish steel edge with his finger. It {{was by no means}} a toy weapon; it had been fashioned and meant for use. What use? Somehow he felt that he had escaped a very great danger, as he put the thing thoughtfully into his pocket, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. <b>The</b> shrill voices and clatter of glasses around him sounded curiously unreal in his ears.|$|R
60|$|She spoke a few {{conventional}} {{words of}} farewell and departed. Outside {{on the pavement}} she stood for a moment, looking carefully around. There {{was no sign of}} Richardson anywhere! She stepped into the carriage and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner.|$|E
60|$|Whatever it meant, she did {{not seem}} to hear him. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner of the sofa like a wooden figure. The {{immovable}} peevishness of the face, framed in the limp, rusty lace, had a character of cruelty.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is great!" [...] exclaimed Alfred, as he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow facing her. [...] "There {{is nothing}} more to be desired. This {{beautiful}} clear stream, the air so fresh, the gold lined banks, the autumn leaves, a guide who--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah but Chad, {{with his}} {{completer}} {{conception of the}} friendly, wouldn't quite have this! They had remained on the balcony, where, after their day of great and premature heat, the midnight air was delicious; and they <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> turn against <b>the</b> balustrade, all <b>in</b> harmony with <b>the</b> chairs and the flower-pots, the cigarettes and the starlight. [...] "The onus isn't REALLY yours--after our agreeing so to wait together and judge together. That was all my answer to Sally," [...] Chad pursued--"that we have been, that we are, just judging together." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Timothy {{resumed his}} seat and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> leisurely fashion. <b>The</b> two attendants solemnly {{released}} their captives. There was a moment's intense silence. The two men seemed fencing for position. There was something stealthy and horrible about their movements as they crept around one another. Francis realised what {{it was almost as}} the little sobbing breath from those of the audience who still retained any emotion, showed him that they, too, foresaw what was going to happen. Both men had drawn knives from their belts. It was murder which had been let loose.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> final, {{the early}} leader was Nigeria as Patience Okon George {{made up the}} stagger on Botswana to her outside {{as they entered the}} far turn. Chrisann Gordon pulled Jamaica close to Nigeria on the inside but lost some ground coming off the turn. Down the home stretch, George faded while Quanera Hayes brought USA into the lead at the handoff to Allyson Felix. Felix ran a fast turn to put some {{separation}} on the field by the break. Further outside, Jamaica's Anneisha McLaughlin-Whilby was <b>the</b> next <b>in</b> contention until about 50 metres into her leg she McLaughlin-Whilby began to hop and <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> pain. <b>The</b> entire field passed her as she tried to continue to the break line before collapsing to the track. Felix and USA had a 20 metre lead over the next best, Nigeria, a metre ahead of Great Britain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] I answered, on {{the sudden}} impulse, [...] "I am an escaped French prisoner." [...] And with that, having tossed my cap over the mills (as they say), I <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> settee, and we {{regarded}} each other.|$|E
60|$|And as {{he spoke}} he {{stretched}} out his legs and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair. His form became less vague, and the colors of his garments more distinct and evident, while an expression of gratified relief succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance.|$|E
60|$|Isabel Worth <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{comfortable}} seat by Granet's {{side and}} breathed a little sigh of content. She had enjoyed her luncheon party a deux, their stroll along the sands afterwards, {{and she was}} fully prepared to enjoy this short drive homewards.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} her hands then {{of her own}} accord. The {{gratitude}} which shone out of her swimming eyes seemed mingled with something which was almost invitation. Laverick was suddenly swept off his feet. Something had come into his life--something absurd, uncounted upon, incomprehensible. The atmosphere of the room seemed electrified. In a moment, he had done what only {{a second or two}} before he had told himself would be the action of a cad. He had taken her, unresisting, up into his arms, kissed her eyes and lips. Afterwards, he was never able to remember those few moments clearly, only {{it seemed to him that}} she had accepted his caress almost without hesitation, with the effortless serenity of a child receiving a natural consolation in a time of trouble. But Laverick was conscious of other feelings as he <b>leaned</b> hard <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner of his taxicab and was driven swiftly away.|$|R
6000|$|As an [...] "Adoration of the Magi," [...] {{the picture}} is, of course, {{sufficiently}} [...] absurd: <b>the</b> St. Sebastian <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner {{to be out}} of the [...] way; the three Magi kneel, without the slightest appearance of [...] emotion, to a Madonna seated in a Venetian loggia of the fifteenth [...] century, and three Venetian servants behind bear their offerings in a [...] very homely sack, tied up at the mouth. As a piece of portraiture and [...] artistical composition, the work is altogether perfect, perhaps the [...] best piece of Tintoret's portrait-painting in existence. It is very [...] carefully and steadily wrought, and arranged with consummate skill on [...] a difficult plan. The canvas is a long oblong, I think about eighteen [...] or twenty feet long, by about seven high; one might almost fancy the [...] painter had been puzzled to bring the piece into use, the figures [...] being all thrown into positions which a little diminish their height. [...] The nearest chamberlain is kneeling, the two behind him bowing [...] themselves slightly, the attendants behind bowing lower, the Madonna [...] sitting, the St. Theodore sitting still lower on the steps at her [...] feet, and the St. Sebastian leaning back, so that all the lines of the [...] picture incline more or less from right to left as they ascend. This [...] slope, which gives unity to the detached groups, is carefully [...] exhibited by what a mathematician would call coordinates,--the upright [...] pillars of the loggia and the horizontal clouds of the beautiful sky. [...] The color is very quiet, but rich and deep, the local tones being [...] brought out with intense force, and the cast shadows subdued, the [...] manner being much more that of Titian than of Tintoret. The sky [...] appears full of light, though it is as dark as the flesh of the faces; [...] and the forms of its floating clouds, as well as of the hills over [...] which they rise, are drawn with a deep remembrance of reality. There [...] are hundreds of pictures of Tintoret's more amazing than this, but I [...] hardly know one that I more love.|$|R
60|$|Outside, {{the throng}} of {{pedestrians}} had grown less, {{but from the}} great restaurant opposite {{a constant stream of}} motor-cars and carriages was slowly bringing away the supper guests. Tavernake stood at the door, watching them idly. The traffic was momentarily blocked and almost opposite to him a motor-car, the simple magnificence of which filled him with wonder, had come to a standstill. The chauffeur and footman both wore livery which was almost white. Inside a swinging vase of flowers was suspended from the roof. A man and a woman <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> luxurious easy-chairs. <b>The</b> man was dark and had the look of a foreigner. The woman was very fair. She wore a long ermine cloak and a tiara of pearls.|$|R
