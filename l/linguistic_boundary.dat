50|$|Lorraine Franconian (Lorraine Franconian: Plàtt, lothrìnger Plàtt; francique lorrain, platt lorrain; Lothringisch) is an {{ambiguous}} designation for dialects of West Central German (Westmitteldeutsch), {{a group of}} High German dialects spoken in the Moselle department of the former north-eastern French region of Lorraine (See <b>Linguistic</b> <b>boundary</b> of Moselle).|$|E
50|$|Place-names are {{one form}} of {{evidence}} for the <b>linguistic</b> <b>boundary</b> during the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near Nantes and Rennes.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on categorical perception of pitch contours has mainly considered {{the contrast between}} tone language and non-tone language listeners. This study investigates not only the influence of tone language vs. non-tone language experience (German vs. Chinese), but also the influence of different tone inventories (Mandarin tones vs. Cantonese tones), on the categorical perception of pitch contours. The {{results show that the}} positions of the identification boundaries do not differ significantly across the 3 groups of listeners, i. e., Mandarin, Cantonese, and German, but that the boundary widths do differ significantly between tone language (Mandarin and Cantonese) listeners and non-tone language (German) listeners, with broader boundary widths for non-tone language listeners. In the discrimination tasks, the German listeners exhibit only psychophysical boundaries, whereas Chinese listeners exhibit <b>linguistic</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and these <b>linguistic</b> <b>boundaries</b> are further shaped by the different tone inventories. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Within Belgium the Flemish, about 60% of the population, form {{a clearly}} {{distinguishable}} group, set apart by their language and customs.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} reading processes of Japanese language learners, {{we have conducted}} an experiment to record eye movements during Japanese text reading using an eye-tracking system. We showed that Japanese native speakers use "forward and backward jumping eye movements" frequently [13] [14]. In this paper, we analyzed further the same eye tracking data. Our goal is to examine whether Japanese learners fix their eye movements at <b>boundaries</b> of <b>linguistic</b> units such as words, phrases or clauses when they start or end "backward jumping". We consider conventional <b>linguistic</b> <b>boundaries</b> as well as boundaries empirically defined based on the entropy of the N-gram model. Another goal {{is to examine the}} relation between the entropy of the N-gram model and the depth of syntactic structures of sentences. Our analysis shows that (1) Japanese learners often fix their eyes at <b>linguistic</b> <b>boundaries,</b> (2) the average of the entropy is the greatest at the fifth depth of syntactic structures...|$|R
