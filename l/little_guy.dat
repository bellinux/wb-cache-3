But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> fighting for his rights.|$|E

500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this <b>little</b> <b>guy!</b> Who would suspect this <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a pain in her ass."

According to later writer James Neff, [...] "When local government did not function, the Press struck with editorial might, {{even if it meant}} using a sledgehammer to crush a gnat.

500|$|Michael Keaton {{returned}} after {{a significant increase}} in his salary to $10 million. Annette Bening was cast as Catwoman after Burton saw her performance in The Grifters, but she dropped out due to her pregnancy. Raquel Welch, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna, Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda, Lorraine Bracco, Jennifer Beals and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role. Sean Young, who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition. Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffer's work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting. Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office. The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role. Kathy Long served as Pfeiffer's body double. On Danny DeVito's casting, Waters explained, [...] "I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin.

Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous <b>little</b> <b>guy,</b> {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot.

500|$|Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American {{character}} {{who served as}} one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II soldier. [...] Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as [...] "an inoffensive, ordinary <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> thrown into the chaos of war." [...] The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the [...] "little guy" [...] living up {{to a sense of}} duty in this time of war. [...] Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 – May 1, 1943.
