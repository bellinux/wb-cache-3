500|$|During United's first league {{game of the}} 2008–09 {{season at}} home to Newcastle United, Carrick was {{substituted}} after just 25 minutes {{as a result of}} an injured ankle in the 1–1 draw. The following day, it was confirmed he would be out for up to three weeks, which ruled him out of the UEFA Super Cup match against Zenit St. Petersburg on 29 August. His return to action came on 13 September in a 2–1 away loss to Liverpool, he was taken off at half-time during after sustaining another injury. Three days later, it was revealed he would be out for up to six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during a challenge with Yossi Benayoun. On 1 November, Carrick scored his first goal of the season in a 4–3 home win over Hull City. His second goal followed two weeks later in a 5–0 home win over Stoke City. His first goal of 2009 came on 22 April as he scored late on in a 2–0 home win over Portsmouth. On 13 May, he assisted Carlos Tevez and then scored a late winner in a 2–1 win away to Wigan. The goal was Carrick's first for United away from home and meant that they only needed one point from their final two games to gain a third successive Premier League title. Carrick ensured a third title in three years with United as they drew with Arsenal 0–0 at home on 18 May to claim an 18th overall English title. On 27 May, Carrick played the full match in the 2009 Champions League Final in a 2–0 defeat by Barcelona. This defeat was described by Carrick as worst night of his career as he said [...] "the game just seemed to pass us by and we were unable to do anything about it. I suppose when you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture,</b> it was still another Champions League final".|$|E

In {{a letter to his}} publisher, Giulio Ricordi asking for a copy of the score, Verdi stated that [...] "I would like to lengthen several pieces to give the opera more character", but he quickly realized that the proposed additions would not be sufficient and that an overhaul of the entire opera was required. He went ahead to advise the impresario of the Lyrique, Léon Carvalho, that more time was needed and urged patience: [...] "I am labouring, labouring, labouring" [...] he assured the impresario and stressed that he wanted to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> and not try to hurry along a re-working of an opera he had written so many years before.|$|E

All I can say is the we put out a new record and money got ain the way.

It's the 2000s; making money as an independent band is a tough gig. What's more important is that the band still exists and is stronger than ever.

50|$|The {{oncology}} {{market was}} fraught with intense competition. As a company {{new to the}} drug discovery space, Signature should have considered looking at a disease area where the market had a high barrier to entry. Although {{it may be difficult}} to discover a cure for certain diseases, i.e. Alzheimer’s Disease, AIDS, and certain orphan diseases, it probably would have been beneficial for Signature to have at least attempted to enter a disease area with less players than that of the oncology space. On the other hand, the company could have simply acknowledged possible weaknesses in becoming a drug discovery company and could have reverted to their original business plan of focusing on screening tools. Signature may have needed to refocus their efforts entirely, though, if choosing this course given the other competitors attempting to reduce R&D costs and time to market, i.e. microtiter plates with more wells. Signature did not seem to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> of their competitors' landscape.|$|E

5000|$|Consider first, the [...] "why" [...] {{aspect of}} the goal to find your purpose for {{achieving}} it. Taking a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> before breaking it into smaller components allows one {{to focus on the}} primary goal attainment. Once the main goal is set, breaking it up into smaller, more achievable components helps in the planning portion of setting the goal. By curating these pieces in an organized timetable the goal setter is alleviated the anxiety one might feel towards large, broad tasks. The smaller components should reflect aspects of the overall goal, but offer more immediate feedback to keep the individual on task. The motivation for the process comes from the value established from larger, long-term goal, while the accomplishments of the smaller short-term goals increase self-esteem. Goals are all future-oriented, and the tendency of people to envision the future version of themselves creates an end desire where the trick is to break down the means in smaller, obtainable objectives. Even if the end is to maintain the current lifestyle that it becomes a goal which can also be fragmented into smaller categories.|$|E

She is deeply saddened of her brother's death and was the only one to shed tears once her brother was pronounced dead in the hospital. Hyun-jin is also the only one to give In-sook the respect that she deserves. She is well liked by employees and others. She is in a constant battle with her sisters-in-law but they are no match for Hyun-jin's ability to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture.</b> Instead of going head to head, Hyun-jin usually walks around the war that usually plagues her brother's and their wives, and by the time anyone notices Hyun-jin has already crossed the finish line. She resembles In-sook's heart with Soon-ho's smarts and ruthlessness, creating the perfect combination of a true JK woman. She has endured a lifetime of coldness from her mother, however she believes it is the cost of being her daughter. She takes over her mother's company in the finale and proves to be a very capable leader, using In-sook's kindness and her mother's cunningness.|$|E

He added that most historians feel ashamed about doing this kind of raw exercise, adding [...] "here’s a guy who hasn’t been afraid to get his hands dirty". Ben Kiernan, director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University commented that [...] "averaging guesses alongside more precise counts can be misleading". Randolph Roth, co-director of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University, said that it is difficult to make a quantitative analysis of an event while not knowing about the qualitative side of the context. He praised White's effort to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture,</b> while adding [...] "it’s going to be hard for many historians to read this book and look at that death toll for Genghis Khan, that 40 million, and not have a sinking feeling".|$|E

[...] He also added that, while losing the race was bittersweet, his Budweiser Chevrolet [...] "just really performed well today {{and we were able to}} lead a lot of laps and just really proud of the guys for the decisions that they made overnight to get that last little bit out of the car today and how it performed was really good. Just caution came out at the wrong time, and we didn't get to make up the ground on the racetrack under green, where Dale was pitted and the way that they came out of the pits just didn't time out well.
