Lett. 92, 050403 (2004) ], we study a rotating (non-) interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic-plus-gaussian <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> potential. By adjusting the amplitude of the laser potential, one can make quadratic-plus-quartic potential,purely quartic potential, and quartic-minus-quadratic potential. We show that an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic-plus-gaussian <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> breaks the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian when rotational frequency is greater than one-half of the lowest energy surface mode frequency. We also show that by increasing the amplitude of the gaussian <b>laser</b> <b>trap,</b> a vortex appears in a slowly rotating Bose-Einstein condensate.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{implementation}} of an optical <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> that incorporates phase conjugate microscopy {{as one of its}} key elements. The <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> consists of a primary trapping beam, and a counterpropagating self-pumped phase conjugate beam, the latter being derived from the primary signalbeam when it is transmitted through the sample and phase conjugated in a photorefractive crystal. Using a fundamental TEMOO gaussian beam from an Ar-ion laser (514 nm), and a barium titanate (BaTiO 3) crystal in the CAT (total internal reflection) geometry, an optical <b>laser</b> <b>trap</b> was created using 25 mW of laser power. Strong transverse optical confinement is reported for — 2. 5 xm diameter polystyrene microspheres, using both high and low numerical aperture (e. g. 60 X, 0. 85 N. A and 10 X, 0. 25 N. A.) objective lenses. By virtue of the phase conjugation process, the present geometry achieves self-alignment of the two counter-propagating beams, as well as photorefractive gain in the ratio of nearly 4 : 1. The system has the potential for implementing several novel image procesing functions unique to the nonlinear phase conjugation process, on living cells confined to an optical <b>laser</b> <b>trap,</b> including aberration correction, contrast reversal, and novelty filtering, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the advent}} of laser cooling techniques, Maxwell’s theory of {{electromagnetism}} had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force, however it wasn’t until {{the turn of the}} twentieth century when studies by Lebedev (1901), Nichols (1901), and Hull (1903) experimentally demonstrated that force. Following that period, in 1933, Frisch exemplified the pressure exerted on atoms by light. Starting in the early 1970s, lasers were then utilized to further explore atom manipulation. The introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as {{the advent of}} laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s. Laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups: Hänsch and Schawlow, and Wineland and Dehmelt. They both outlined a process of slowing heat-based velocity in atoms by “radiative forces.” In the paper by Hänsch and Schawlow, the effect of radiative pressure on any object that reflects light is described. That concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas. [...] These early proposals for laser cooling only relied on “scattering force,” the name for the radiative force. In later proposals, <b>laser</b> <b>trapping,</b> a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force, would be introduced.|$|E
50|$|Several {{approaches}} {{were applied}} in microfluidics facilitating single cell trapping for single cell analysis, {{which can be}} broadly classified into contact based approach and contact-less approach. Different cell trapping methods are hydrodynamic trapping, dielectrophoresis trapping, chemical trapping, gel trapping, magnetic trapping, acoustic trapping and <b>laser</b> <b>trapping.</b> Each method has its own merits and demerits. Mostly these process requires auxiliary facilities like a pump or a pressurecontrolling system for fluid introduction and guidance, and some need specialized electronics or optical equipment which are not common in a medical or biological laboratory and induce further obstacles for operation. The auxiliary parts occupy much space and thereby greatly lowers the area density of single-cell arrays. Design structures of many microfluidic chips are complicated due {{to the need for}} multiple layers, channels, and valves, which are difficult to either fabricate or manipulate. Thus the practical applications in clinics or general biological laboratories are limited due to these drawbacks. Increasing demand for trapping based on the design itself, involving unsophisticated basic laboratory instruments for single cell measurements led to the evolution of hydrodynamic trapping technique. This way, cells which may be affected due to the presence of an external field/force are preserved. Apart from the simplicity of the process, the natural state of the separated particles can be useful for many kinds research. Based on the approach used, hydrodynamic trapping can be broadly classified into the contact-based and contact-less approach. Figure 1 shows the diverse approaches involved in single cell trapping. Different principal mechanisms were used in hydrodynamic trapping as shown in Figure 2. Hydrodynamic trapping mechanism includes cross-stream migration, vortices based trapping and externally controlled signal approach.|$|E

2500|$|While {{earlier version}} of fiber-based <b>laser</b> <b>traps</b> {{exclusively}} used single mode beams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation of further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the realization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were able to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a microscope. The main advantage of the so-called [...] "optical cell rotator" [...] technology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from imaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of divergent <b>laser</b> <b>traps</b> with biological material indicates the great potential of this new generation of <b>laser</b> <b>traps</b> in medical research and life science.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> {{technique}} has been actively applied to elucidate {{the property of}} macromolecules, DNA, RNA, cytoskeleton fibres, etc. Due to the inherent difficulty in the direct trapping of single molecules at approximately 300 K, most of the current studies on <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> utilize the experimental technique to grasp microbeads that are attached to a single macromolecule, instead of using direct trapping.

40|$|This thesis reports {{exploratory}} research on new optical and chemical phenomena of molecular, metal and nanoparticle systems induced in a confined optical field. We {{provide important insights}} on reconfiguration dynamics in liquid crystal droplets, and deposition and patterning of metal nanostructures on graphene by continuous wave (cw) laser irradiation. Molecular orientation in individual laser-trapped liquid crystal droplets propagates from the focus {{to the surface of}} the droplets. Localized photoexcitation of a single layer graphene leads to the reduction of gold ions in solution depositing single aggregates of nanoparticles. However, the dynamics involving gradient force characteristics of <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> remain unclarified and are left for future experiments. The electronic orbital of the deposited material is changed, which enables us to monitor the deposition process by Raman spectroscopy. This deposition method can be applied to various metals and extended to nanostructure fabrication. We have succeeded in demonstrating the high potential of <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> in the manipulation and fabrication of functional material. We also report unique results on femtosecond (fs) <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> dynamics of dielectric nanoparticles and quantum dots. Polystyrene nanoparticles show trapping and consequent ejection behavior, while silica nanoparticles do not although their mechanical and optical parameters are similar. When the surface of the silica nanoparticles is silanized, the directional ejection is realized. Hydrophobic interactions lead to formation of a single transient assembly of the nanoparticles in the trapping well, which is critical for the unique trapping and ejection behavior. Quantum dots with the size of a few nm are efficiently trapped by fs laser, although it is difficult by cw laser. In fs trapping, temporal force and nonlinear optical susceptibility contribute to gradient force, and the importance of two photon excitation is confirmed. These results indicate that the fs laser exerts a strong attractive and scattering force upon nanoparticles, depending on their optical and material conditions, resulting in their specific trapping, assembly formation, ejection leading to local flow, and so on. We have explored a new fs <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> phenomenon, on which a next generation <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> study will be made.

40|$|As a {{powerful}} and noninvasive tool, <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> has been widely applied for the confinement and physiological study of biological cells and organelles. Researchers have used the single spot laser trap to hold individual sperm and quantitatively evaluated the motile force generated by a sperm. Early studies revealed the relationship between sperm motility and swimming behavior and helped the investigations in medical aspects of sperm activity. As sperm chemotaxis draws more and more interest in fertilization research, the studies on sperm-egg communication may help to explain male or female infertility and provide exciting new approaches to contraception. However, single spot <b>laser</b> <b>trapping</b> can only be used to investigate an individual target, which has limits in efficiency and throughput. To study the chemotactic response of sperm to eggs and to characterize sperm motility, an annular laser trap with a diameter of several hundred microns is designed, simulated with ray tracing tool, and implemented. An axicon transforms the wavefront such that the laser beam is incident on the microscope objective from all directions while filling the back aperture completely for high efficiency trapping. A trapping experiment with microspheres is carried out to evaluate the system performance. The power requirement for annular sperm trapping is determined experimentally and compared with theoretical calculations.

Rupture force for both selectins increased with loading rate, but significant differences in rupture force between P- and L-selectin were observed only above 460 pN/s. These data are best represented as two energy barriers to unbinding, with the transition from the low to high loading rate regime at 260 – 290 pN/s. The data also allow the first estimate of a two-dimensional specific on-rate for binding of these two selectins to their natural ligand (1. 7 mm 2 /s). These data suggest that P- and L-selectin lectin domains have very similar kinetics under physiological conditions...|$|R
