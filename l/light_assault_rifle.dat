50|$|Purchasers of the HK417 have {{typically}} intended it to complement <b>lighter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>rifles</b> chambered for less powerful intermediate cartridges (often 5.56×45mm NATO), for the designated marksman's role. The HK417's greater accuracy, effective range, and penetration offset its greater expense, its lower rate of fire, and its smaller ammunition capacity both in magazine and carriage.|$|R
5000|$|Later, even lighter {{carbines}} {{variants of}} many of these short-barreled <b>assault</b> <b>rifles</b> came to be adopted as the standard infantry weapon. In much modern tactical thinking, only a certain number of soldiers now need to retain longer-range weapons, these serving as designated marksmen. The rest can carry lighter, shorter-ranged weapons for close-quarters combat and suppressive fire. This is basically a more extreme extension of the idea that brought the original <b>assault</b> <b>rifle.</b> Another factor is that with the increasing weight of technology, sighting systems, ballistic armor, etc., the only way to reduce the burden on the modern soldier was to equip him/her with a smaller, lighter weapon. Also, modern soldier rely a great deal on vehicles and helicopters to transport them around the battle area, and a longer weapon can be a serious hindrance to entering and exiting these vehicles. Development of <b>lighter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>rifles</b> continued, matched by developments in even lighter carbines. In spite of the short barrels of the new <b>assault</b> <b>rifles,</b> carbines variants like the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U and Colt Commando were being developed for use when mobility was essential and a submachine gun wasn't sufficiently powerful. The AKS-74U featured an extremely short 8.1" [...] barrel which necessitated redesigning and shortening the gas-piston and integrating front sights onto the gas tube; the Colt Commando was a bit longer, at 11.5". Neither was adopted as standard issue, although the US did later adopt the somewhat-longer M4 carbine, with a 14.5" [...] barrel.|$|R
