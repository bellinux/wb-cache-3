25|$|By 26 November, {{artillery}} {{support for}} the division had increased from the two mountain howitzers to include six 25-pounders. Warren Force was to concentrate its efforts against {{the eastern end of}} the New Strip. On the 22nd, the III/128th was moved to there, leaving a company to guard the Simemi Track. The front was adjusted, with III/128th taking the right, seaward flank. I/126th remained in the centre, with the 2/6th Independent Company to the <b>left.</b> <b>Here,</b> the coast ran south to north toward Cape Endaiadere so that the axis of advance toward the cape was north. The I/128th was positioned behind the I/126th. It was tasked to move through the I/128th, west, {{along the edge of the}} New Strip. The I/128th was to advance north-west and the III/128th on a northerly axis. This plan, with attacking troops moving on three different axes, was perhaps altogether too complex.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, [...] "I am {{one of the few people}} <b>left</b> <b>here</b> who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." [...] He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his Los Alamos work.|$|E

500|$|On 19 December {{they reached}} New Zealand where Darwin thought the tattooed Māori to be savages with {{character}} of a much lower order than the Tahitians, and noted that they and their homes were [...] "filthily dirty and offensive". He saw missionaries bringing improvement in character {{as well as new}} farming practices with an exemplary [...] "English farm" [...] employing natives. Richard Matthews was <b>left</b> <b>here</b> with his elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at Kaitaia. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist Augustus Earle which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from New South Wales. By 30 December he was glad to leave New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have <b>left</b> <b>here</b> in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are <b>left</b> <b>here.</b> I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

500|$|The Chapel of Christ {{and of the}} Reliquaries (...) {{was built}} in 1615 and {{designed}} with ultra-Baroque details which are often difficult {{to see in the}} poorly lit interior. [...] It was originally known as the Christ of the Conquistadors. That name came from an image of Christ that was supposedly donated to the cathedral by Emperor Charles V. [...] Over time, so many reliquaries were left on its main altar that its name was eventually changed. Of 17thcentury ornamentation, the main altarpiece alternates between carvings of rich foliage and small heads on its columns in the main portion and small sculptures of angels on its telamons in the secondary portion. Its niches hold sculptures of saints framing the main body. Its crucifix is from the 17thcentury. The predella is finished with sculptures of angels, and also contains small 17thpaintings of martyred saints by Juan de Herrera. Behind these paintings, hidden compartments contain some of the numerous reliquaries <b>left</b> <b>here.</b> Its main painting was done by Jose de Ibarra and dated 1737. Surrounding the altar is a series of paintings on canvas, depicting the Passion of Christ by Jose Villegas, painted in the 17thcentury. On the right-hand wall, an altar dedicated to the Virgin of the Confidence is decorated with numerous churrigueresque figurines tucked away in niches, columns and top pieces.|$|E
500|$|There {{she gives}} birth to Sigurd. Sigurd is raised by Regin, a cunning old man, and when he grows to manhood he asks for a horse from King Elf. Elf bids him choose the one he likes best, and Sigurd takes the best horse, and names it Grani. Sigurd is now urged by Regin to attack Fafnir, a dragon who guards a hoard of gold. This {{treasure}} is a curse to all who possess it. Fafnir, Regin says, was originally a human being; indeed, the dragon was Regin's brother and thus the gold rightfully belongs to Regin. He tries and fails to forge an adequate sword for Sigurd, but Sigurd produces the shattered fragments of Odin's sword, which he has inherited from Sigmund, and from these fragments Regin forges a mighty sword, named [...] "the Wrath" [...] by Sigurd. Sigurd {{makes his way to}} Fafnir's lair, kills him, drinks his blood, and roasts and eats his heart. This gives him the power to understand the voices of birds and to read the hearts of men. He now understands that Regin intends to kill him, and so he kills Regin and takes Fafnir's treasure for himself. On his journey homeward Sigurd comes across an unearthly blaze on the slopes of Hindfell. He rides straight into it and comes unharmed {{to the heart of the}} fire, where he finds a beautiful sleeping woman clad in armour. He wakes her, and she tells him that she is Brynhild, a handmaiden of Odin whom he has <b>left</b> <b>here</b> as a punishment for disobedience. They pledge themselves to each other, Sigurd places a ring from Fafnir's hoard on her finger, and he leaves.|$|E
2500|$|From 1862 LNWR {{officials}} made regular {{inspections of}} the railway, and an inspection in June {{of this year}} led to an attempt to find a larger workshop site than that here at Cromford. A level site at Ladmanlow, some [...] along the line, was considered, but a report by Charles Mason the following month suggested only a small maintenance shop there. Given that 18 men were employed at Cromford, and that many of their children worked in Arkwright's mill, it was <b>left</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The sidings {{were closed}} to {{scheduled}} traffic on 10 January 1971. They {{have now been}} refurbished, {{although the number of}} sidings is greatly reduced. They were temporarily used for offloading stone traffic during the 1990s, but now see regular cement trains to [...] on the Looe branch in Cornwall. These are split into two portions, one being <b>left</b> <b>here</b> while the Freightliner locomotive takes the first section forward before returning later in the day for the remaining wagons. The sidings are also used for stabling railway engineers' vehicles. In 2012 a new Network Rail Recycling Depot was opened. This has resulted in regular engineers' trains bringing sections of rail to the yard for cutting before being sold to local scrap merchants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm <b>left</b> <b>here</b> to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{precursors}} to {{the modern}} football codes were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, described a game in Llandrygan as ending with [...] "umbers of players... <b>left</b> <b>here</b> and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured." [...] William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting [...] "as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale... having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip were {{a pair of}} closely {{associated}} forts on the Mississippi River. They were sited some [...] above Head of Passes, where the river divides before it finally enters the Gulf of Mexico, or about [...] downstream from New Orleans. Fort Jackson {{was on the right}} (generally west, but here south) bank, while Fort St. Philip was on the <b>left</b> (<b>here,</b> north) bank of the river. Because of the path of the river, Fort Jackson was actually somewhat east of Fort St. Philip. Designed for defense against invasion in the days of sail, the two forts were sited near a bend in the river that would force ships to slow down in passing, so they would be nearly stationary targets under the 177 guns of the forts that bore on the channel.|$|E

Flowing by Beaver Island, on the right, the river reaches the Wheatland Ferry, which carries vehicles traveling on Wheatland Road. Beyond the ferry, the river passes the Wheatland, Upper and Lower Martine, Matheny, and Eldridge bars and receives Eldridge Slough from the right at about RM69 (RK111). Passing the Snaggy Bend, Allison, Fairfield, and Duke bars, the river reaches Lambert Bar and receives Lambert Slough from the left. The river flows around Five Islands, the Five Islands Bar and the Coffee, Weston, Candiani, and Mission bars before receiving the Yamhill River from the left [...] from the mouth. About [...] below the Yamhill, Chehalem Creek enters from the left, and then the river flows around Ash Island, where it receives High Water Slough from the right. Downstream of the island, the city of Newberg is on the left, [...] from the mouth.|$|E
