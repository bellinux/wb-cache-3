5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, silyl ethers, various <b>lactams</b> and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E

40|$|Beta <b>lactam</b> {{antibiotics}} are a broad {{class of}} antibiotics {{which consists of}} all antibiotic agents that contains β-lactam ring in their molecular structures. Most beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in bacterial species and are most widely applicable group of antibiotics. Extended-spectrum β-lactamases are the mutant, plasmid mediated enzymes which hydrolyse the beta <b>lactam</b> ring of the antibiotics.

5000|$|Anhydroaspergillomarasmine A, a <b>lactam</b> of aspergillomarasmine A, {{chemically}} called 1-(2-amino-2carboxyethyl)-6-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-3-piperazinone, {{can also}} be found in Pyrenophora teres.

50|$|Vince <b>lactam</b> is the {{commercial}} name {{given to the}} bicyclic molecule γ-lactam 2-azabicyclo2.2.1hept-5-en-3-one.

It is named after Robert Vince who has used the structural features of this molecule for the preparation of carbocyclic nucleosides. Vince's work with this <b>lactam</b> eventually led to his synthesis of abacavir. Peramivir synthesis is also dependent on Vince <b>lactam</b> starting material.|$|R
25|$|Overall, the {{research}} shows that all beta <b>lactams</b> have the intrinsic hazard of very serious hazardous reactions in susceptible patients. Only the frequency of these reactions vary, based on the structure. Recent papers have shown that a major feature in determining frequency of immunological reactions is the similarity of the side chains (e.g., first generation cephalosporins are similar to penicillins), {{and this is the}} reason the β-lactams are associated with different frequencies of serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis).|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} number of anti-infectives are based on natural products. The first antibiotic to be discovered, penicillin, was isolated from the mold Penicillium. [...] Penicillin and related beta <b>lactams</b> work by inhibiting DD-transpeptidase enzyme that is required by bacteria to cross link peptidoglycan to form the cell wall.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the family}} {{commonly}} express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, {{a new group of}} enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Thus ESBLs confer multi-resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta <b>lactams.</b> In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. [...] A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. [...] The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily ertapenem resistant) isolates have recently been reported. [...] ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. [...] However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.|$|E
