Three electrodynamic shakers coupled to a common payload mounting platform provided this disturbance environment. The main focus of this project was upon the mechanical design and finite element analysis of the components which couple the three actuators to the mounting platform. Specially-designed flexures were utilized instead of conventional ball-and-socket joints to eliminate friction from the system.

40|$|The current {{popularity}} of suspension and levitation stems {{no doubt the}} possibilities in high-speed ground transportation schemes. Although these are both challenging and exciting, there is considerable scope for application of suspension techniques to achieving frictionless bearing. The requirement {{in this case is}} often for close tolerances, low power consumption, small airgaps and ingeneral, compactness. Thus, magnetic suspension using DC electromagnets schemes have received more attention than the other techniques of repulsion levitation. Proposed prototype system consists of a conventional stator and its rotor without iron core, set of electromagnets for suspension of rotor shaft and set of compensation circuits feedbacked by optical-transducers. Prototyped system is aimed as a laboratory demonstration tool so there is no challenging to exceed the speeds of 1500 rev/min that is the speed of motor with mechanical <b>bearings.</b> Magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> provides a high impact visual demonstration of many principles in undergraduate educational programs in electrical education, e. g., electromagnetic design, PD controlled compensation of a unstable control system and power amplifier design.

40|$|One {{approach}} for implementing a control {{system for a}} magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> for high-speed rotating machinery is to use embedded DSP boards. Yet control systems based on DSP boards often require specialized programming and development tools, lack interoperability with standardized architectures and tools, and lack flexibility when computational requirements change. For reasons of cost and upgrade capabilities, it is instead desirable to implement these control systems with general-purpose, commodity PCs. Achieving adequate computational throughput is a major challenge however, even with the most advanced computer systems available today. This paper describes several improvements we make on a previous, uniprocessor version of our real-time controls platform {{in order to support}} more computationally-intensive, higher-order magnetic bearing controllers. First, the controls platform is made multiprocessor-capable and gain-scheduled controllers are computed asynchronously on the second processor in the dual-CPU system. Second, new floating-point computation instructions supported by the Pentium III and Pentium 4 are used to speed up the matrix calculation. Finally, other performance-tuning techniques are used in combination with increases in commodity processor computing speeds to optimize the controller. The results show a tremendous improvement in the overall throughput of this real time control platform, without sacrificing predictability. This improvement makes it feasible to implement these highorder magnetic bearing controllers which in turn push the performance of rotating machinery to a higher level...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} mechanical inertially stabilized platform (ISP), magnetic suspension ISP (MSISP) can absorb high frequency vibrations via a magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> with five {{degrees of freedom}} between azimuth and pitch gimbals. However, force acting between rotor and stator will introduce coupling torque to roll and pitch gimbals. Since the disturbance of magnetic bearings has strong nonlinearity, classic state feedback control algorithm cannot bring higher precision control for MSISP. In order to enhance the control accuracy for MSISP, a disturbance compensator based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is developed {{to compensate for the}} disturbance. Using the Lyapunov theorem, the weighting matrix of RBFNN can be updated online. Therefore, the RBFNN can be constructed without priori training. At last, simulations and experiment results validate that the compensation method proposed in this paper can improve ISP accuracy significantly...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the in vitro <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of four-unit posterior frameworks made of glass ceramic with lithium-disilicate crystals (E 2), of zirconia-reinforced glass-infiltrated alumina (ICZ) and of zirconia stabilized with 3 mol% yttria (CEZ). METHODS: All frameworks mimicked a four-unit posterior situation with 7. 3 mm 2 interdental cross-sections and possessed exactly the same dimensions. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was measured on a special bridge test setup with 15 specimens for each of the materials. The data were analyzed with Weibull statistics giving the characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity F 0 at 63 % failure probability and the Weibull modulus m as indicator for the reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: For the E 2 frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and the SD was 260 (+/- 53) N, the characteristic load F 0 282 N and the reliability m = 5. 7. For the ICZ frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was 470 (+/- 101) N, F 0 518 N and m = 4. 5.

The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake. The dynamic effect is determined by the means of a linear modal analysis with a response spectrum. The core of the thesis is represented in the analysis and the dimensioning of typical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements in the building. Firstly, dimensioning of the lower and upper reinforcement is executed. The calculation results are compared to the amount of built-in reinforcement, information about which is gathered from the original project documentation that followed the old PBAB regulation. Next, is the dimensioning of wall AB and column AB. The reinforcement for both is constructed in accordance with ductile behaviour requirements.

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. For slender <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
