40|$|This guide <b>on</b> <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> and Compensation {{is written}} {{for people who}} work in land {{administration}} and all those with an interest in land, land tenure and their governance. Compulsory acquisition is the power of government to acquire private rights in land without the willing consent of its owner or occupant in order to benefit society. This power is often necessary for social and economic development and the protection of the natural environment. Compulsory acquisition requires finding the balance between the public need for land on the one hand, and the provision of land tenure security and the protection of private property rights on the other hand. Compulsory acquisition is inherently disruptive. Even when compensation is generous and procedures are generally fair and efficient, the displacement of people from established homes, businesses and communities will still entail significant human costs. Where the process is designed or implemented poorly, the economic, social and political costs may be enormous. Attention to the procedures of compulsory acquisition is critical if a government’s exercise of compulsory acquisition is to be efficient, fair and legitimate. This guide explains what compulsory acquisition and compensation are, and what constitutes good practice in this area. It examines the consequences of poor legislation, procedures and implementation in <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> and compensation and looks at how they can be improved in general, as well as in some specific areas in which <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> and compensation can be problematic. It draws out the lessons learned from the extensive experience and field programmes of FAO and the World Bank, and from parallel work in urban areas. The focus of the guide is broad, covering the widest range of possible situations. The guide is likely to be of most use in countries that are seeking to understand good practice in this area and to improve their own legislation, procedures and implementation in <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> and compensation in the interests of society as a whole...|$|R

40|$|AFTERTHE SECONDWORLDWAR, Sweden {{became one}} of the {{immigrant}} countries of Europe. The number of immigrants in Sweden is presently about 1 million, which is roughly 12 percent of the total population. They represent widely differing cultures and speak about 130 different languages. In Sweden there are three main types of immigration. The most common is labor immigration, which is represented by those who come to Sweden to find work or better-paying work. They generally come from the other Nordic countries, especially Finland, and from Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. The other two types are refugee immigration, resulting from political, religious and/or ethnic circumstances in their native countries; and specialist immigration, which includes technical specialists, doctors, students, and others. At first the authorities in Sweden, as in many other immigrant countries, tried to assimilate the immigrants into Swedish society as quickly as possible. In the 1960 s, however, some farsighted people tried to convince the authorities that they were on the wrong path, {{and in the middle of}} the decade the Swedish government began an investigation of the cultural needs of the immigrants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is limited to {{defining}} the differences of the functions and of the operation of compulsory licences, which typically are available under patent <b>law,</b> <b>on</b> one hand, or, on the other, are imposed {{as a matter of}} enforcing the antitrust laws. The thesis of this contribution is that each of patent law’s compulsory licensing rules does (and ought to) follow its own distinct rationale. Their common denominator is that they are specific to the systematic operation of patent protection as an incentive mechanism for innovation. By contrast, competition law constitutes part of the framework regulation of the market. Where its application results in imposing licensing obligations on patentees, it does so in order to correct an unjustified restriction of competition. This remedial function of antitrust-related licensing obligations is complementary to but different from patent <b>law’s</b> rules <b>on</b> <b>compulsory</b> licensing. The different functions of system-supportive or system-intrinsic mandatory licensing rules and competition-related obligations also mean that before introducing new or broadening existing provisions <b>on</b> <b>compulsory</b> licences a proper diagnosis has to be made of the ill that they are supposed to cure...|$|R

40|$|Germany is {{the focus}} of this paper, owing to the fact that since 1938 it has had the strictest <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> <b>compulsory</b> {{schooling}} worldwide. As a result, homeschooling in Germany has become virtually impossible. There are interesting divergences between policy and practice in the German setting, both in the country’s educational history and present educational problems. The Länder (federal states) have the responsibility for education, and they are taking a much stricter line against homeschoolers than a decade ago, especially by depriving parents of the custody of their homeschooled children at an early stage. The laws relied upon, however, were never intended to deal with such educational matters; they were designed to punish parents who abuse or neglect their children. The present, highly questionable legal action succeeds only because of the consent of state schools, state social welfare offices, and courts. The same laws are not used against the parents of the approximately 250, 000 teens who are truant. The functioning of the legal and sociological machinery in Germany is being employed aggressively to stamp out homeschooling, {{while at the same time}} it ignores the crucial issue of parents who allow their children to skip school—thus depriving them of an adequate education at home or elsewhere. At the same time, the number of specialists in law and education, as well as politicians and governmental experts who argue in favor of homeschooling is growing, and media reports on homeschooling are much more positive than they were a decade ago...|$|R
