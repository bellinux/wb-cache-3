5|$|In these {{compliance}} models {{the possibility}} of entities breaking a law has both a <b>likelihood</b> of occurrence and a consequence of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'. Considering entities' <b>likelihood</b> of not complying {{and the consequences of}} their not complying usually provides a 'power distribution' of a few large consequence or higher <b>likelihood</b> clients and many more lower consequence/likelihood ones.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum <b>likelihood</b> to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the <b>likelihood</b> to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual <b>likelihood</b> points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

Specifically, we first obtain the object <b>likelihoods</b> in each image with saliency detection [17], and then estimate the latent parameters to update the object <b>likelihoods.</b> The <b>likelihoods</b> of the heat sources are further updated among images via message transferring which is fulfilled by belief propagation [13], and diffused to other superpixels using random walks [15] within individual image.

We give some properties of these <b>likelihoods,</b> showing how they can be computed numerically by use of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Then, {{in the context of a}} data set for which no plausible physical model is apparent, we show how these <b>likelihoods</b> give useful inferences for the location of a distribution.

5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher <b>likelihood</b> and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed <b>likelihood</b> or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum <b>likelihood</b> estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum <b>likelihood</b> will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
2500|$|In general, in {{needing to}} run {{simulations}} rather than compute <b>likelihoods,</b> {{it may be}} difficult to make fine-scale inferences on epidemiological parameters, and instead, this work usually focuses on broader questions, testing whether overall genealogical patterns are consistent with one epidemiological model or another. [...] Additionally, simulation-based methods are often used to validate inference results, providing test data where the correct answer is known ahead of time. Because computing <b>likelihoods</b> for genealogical data under complex simulation models has proven difficult, an alternative statistical approach called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is becoming popular in fitting these simulation models to patterns of genetic variation, following successful application of this approach to bacterial diseases. This is because ABC makes use of easily computable summary statistics to approximate <b>likelihoods,</b> rather than the <b>likelihoods</b> themselves.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a graphical method, likelihood-mapping, {{to visualize the}} phylogenetic content {{of a set of}} aligned sequences. The method is based on an analysis of the maximum <b>likelihoods</b> for the three fully resolved tree topologies that can be computed for four sequences. The three <b>likelihoods</b> are represented as one point inside an equilateral triangle. The triangle is partitioned in different regions. One region represents star-like evolution, three regions represent a well-resolved phylogeny, and three regions reflect the situation where it is difficult to distinguish between two of the three trees. The location of the <b>likelihoods</b> in the triangle defines the mode of sequence evolution. If n sequences are analyzed, then the <b>likelihoods</b> for each subset of four sequences are mapped onto the triangle. The resulting distribution of points shows whether the data are suitable for a phylogenetic reconstruction or not...|$|R
