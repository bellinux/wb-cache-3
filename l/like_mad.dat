5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers <b>like</b> <b>Mad</b> Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.|$|E

25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them out. We were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed <b>like</b> <b>mad,</b> yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Moore {{writes in}} the e-book Metal Missionaries that during mid-1990s Christian metal [...] "ceased to play catch up (replicating secular bands) and began to {{assimilate}} into its rightful place in the Extreme music scene and the artists who played became influential in helping to define this relatively new, but growing genre." [...] With risen musical quality and more street-credibility, Christian metal and hardcore bands were signed to record labels such as Tooth and Nail, Solid State, Facedown Records as well as secular labels Metal Blade and Victory Records. Christian metal was available through non-Christian outlets; [...] "For the first time Extreme Christian music moved from the dusty back bin of the Christian book stores to the front racks at super retailers like Best Buy, Circuit City, FYE and even giant retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Hot Topic." [...] The German secular metal label Nuclear Blast Records also released Christian metal. Torodd Fuglesteg of Norway's Arctic Serenades Records has claimed: [...] "The owner of Nuclear Blast was a committed Christian and he was pushing everything with that religious agenda through Nuclear Blast. Mortification and Horde were pushed <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> by Nuclear Blast when other labels were pushing pure satanic stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
500|$|Various {{third-party}} controllers {{from companies}} <b>like</b> <b>Mad</b> Catz include additional buttons and other extra features; third-parties also manufactured arcade-style joysticks for fighting games, such as Agetech's Arcade Stick and Interact's Alloy Arcade Stick. [...] Mad Catz and Agetec created racing wheels for racing games. [...] Sega decided against releasing its official light {{gun in the}} U.S., but some third party light guns were available. The Dreamcast supports a Sega fishing [...] "reel and rod" [...] motion controller and a keyboard for text entry. Although it was designed for fishing games such as Sega Bass Fishing, Soul Calibur was playable with the fishing controller, which translated vertical and horizontal movements into on-screen swordplay {{in a manner that}} was retroactively cited as a predecessor to the Wii Remote. The Japanese Dreamcast port of Sega's Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram supported a [...] "Twin Sticks" [...] peripheral, but the game's American publisher, Activision, opted not to release it in the U.S. The Dreamcast could connect to SNK's Neo Geo Pocket Color, predating Nintendo's GameCube–Game Boy Advance link cable. Sega also produced the Dreameye, a digital camera that could be connected to the Dreamcast and used to exchange pictures and participate in video chat over the system's Internet connection. Sega hoped developers would use the Dreameye for future software, as some later did with Sony's similar EyeToy peripheral. In addition, Sega investigated systems that would have allowed users to make telephone calls with the Dreamcast, and discussed with Motorola the development of an Internet-enabled cell phone that would have used technology from the console to enable quick downloads of games and other data.|$|E
2500|$|According to Syrian media, anti-government rebels {{initiated}} the fighting, who [...] "pounced on our comrades while sleeping {{in their homes}} and killed whomever they could kill of women and children, mutilating the bodies of the martyrs in the streets, driven, <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> dogs, by their black hatred." [...] Security forces then [...] "rose to confront these crimes" [...] and [...] "taught the murderers a lesson that has snuffed out their breath".|$|E

2500|$|In March 1994 Semic Interprint {{launched}} the bimonthly Kretén (cretin). This absurd and satirical humor magazine is somewhat <b>like</b> <b>Mad</b> or Fluide Glacial.

2500|$|Micuta was {{the actual}} {{commander}} {{of one of}} the captured tanks, which was nicknamed Magda, and used it in an operation which liberated the Gęsiówka concentration camp. [...] The operation freed some 350 Polish, Greek, Hungarian and French Jews. One of the freed inmates, Henryk Lederman, organized a battalion from the liberated Jews, which he presented to Micuta. This unit fought under Micuta {{for the remainder of the}} uprising, according to Micuta [...] " [...] <b>like</b> <b>mad...</b> I think only three of them survived." ...|$|E

During a tour of Thuringia, he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries. In Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants, written on his return to Wittenberg, he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth, condemned the violence as the devil's work, and called for the nobles to put down the rebels <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> dogs: ...|$|E

2500|$|Beauford and {{his younger}} brother, Joseph, were both {{attracted}} to art from an early age. Some of their earliest drawings were copies of Sunday school cards and pictures from the family bible. [...] "Those early years which Beauford and I enjoyed together I am sure shaped the direction of our lives as artists. We were constantly doing something with our hands – modelling with the very red Tennessee clay, also copying pictures. One distinct difference in Beauford and myself was his multi-talents. Beauford could always strum on a ukulele and sing <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> and could mimic with the best. Beauford and I were complete opposites: me an introvert and Beauford the extrovert." [...] The Delaneys attended Knoxville's Austin High School, and among Beauford's early works was a portrait of Austin High principal Charles Cansler.|$|E

And now thou thyself too hast part in a <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> passion; and some god of affliction has given thee Jason to be thy grievous woe.

2500|$|... "I {{never would}} have {{amounted}} to anything in the theatre if it hadn't been for Orson Welles," [...] Lee recalled. [...] "The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right—and {{it was a wonderful}} sensation, knowing it was right. Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it could say. I had the ambition—I caught it from Orson Welles—to work <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> and be a convincing actor." ...|$|E

50|$|During these years, Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at the Staffordshire dye works of Thomas Wardle, mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, <b>like</b> <b>madder,</b> which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines.|$|R
2500|$|Beatles for Sale was the Beatles' fourth album {{release in}} the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager, later reflected: [...] "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A lot of it was down to naiveté, {{thinking}} that this was the way things were done. If the record company needs another album, you go and make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale. One must remember that they'd been battered <b>like</b> <b>mad</b> throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success is a wonderful thing but it is very, very tiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hollywood Reporter {{also wrote}} that Game of Thrones made a [...] "strong case for {{being one of}} TV's best series". Impressed that the series {{continued}} to improve in quality as it breathed life into its vast web of interconnected storylines, the reviewer considered that, unlike other genre shows, Game of Thrones had gravitas such {{that it should not}} be considered dramatically inferior to shows <b>like</b> <b>Mad</b> Men or Breaking Bad. HitFixs Alan Sepinwall gave the new, [...] "bigger and better" [...] season an [...] "A", praising its increased confidence and smoothness despite its even greater use of [...] "sexposition". New to the series, the Chicago Sun-Timess reviewer found the season premiere [...] "engrossing" [...] and praised the [...] "top-notch" [...] acting, writing, sets and storytelling. The New York Times was the only major publication to publish a mixed review. It criticized the lack of complexity in the characters apart from Dinklage's, the confusing multitude of characters and the meandering plot.|$|E
2500|$|Dany Roth of blastr.com was {{impressed}} by the show's costume designs, stating that they are [...] "possibly the best on TV right now.

[...] He said that, <b>like</b> <b>Mad</b> Max, The 100 [...] "understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.", and although [...] "there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting", it is the clothes that tell the story. [...] "I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here," [...] he added, [...] "a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the [...] "most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic eyes looking out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint." [...] Debnam-Carey said, [...] "I'm lucky they put me in such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? Should we do tears? Should we do the bindi?'"
