5|$|Across {{the western}} Caribbean Sea, the {{developing}} storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. About 90people {{were killed in}} the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. Damage was <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, and there were no casualties.|$|E

[...] The closer light is {{referred}} to as the beacon or front range; the furthest away is called the rear range. The rear range light is almost always taller than the front.|$|R
5|$|Boron nitride can be doped p-type with {{beryllium}} and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped {{with carbon}} and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy {{corresponding to the}} UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 215–250nm and therefore can potentially be used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green and red part of the spectrum, thereby effectively producing bright light.|$|E
5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E

5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some balls {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E
5|$|However, the SA Cricket Association had no {{hesitation}} in appointing Bradman as their {{delegate to the}} Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside {{some of the men}} he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration of the game.

5|$|In 2007, Quique was re-released in a deluxe edition. This {{version of}} the album {{included}} a bonus disc containing unreleased tracks, re-mixes and songs that appeared on compilation albums.

It was released with a gate fold sleeve with 1000 copies printed on blue vinyl.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Opticks, {{which was then}} the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, {{at least until the}} development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles.

5|$|Males’ sexual {{maturation}} is triggered by an increased proportion of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photoperiod, {{such that they}} are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development.

5|$|Some of the {{architectural}} features incorporated throughout the castle included: corbelled battlemented wallheads on the towers; turrets set above {{first or second}} storey level; a large elongated aperture provided <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first floor hall; and shot holes in the southwest tower. The fenestrations on the wing added in the late 18th century differed from those used in earlier parts of the structure, being larger and more regular in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The defects can be {{detected}} by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
5|$|While Fossett had financed five {{previous}} tries himself, {{his successful}} record-setting flight {{was sponsored by}} Bud <b>Light.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights.

Along with sponsorship, that payout meant {{that in the end}} Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.|$|E

5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
