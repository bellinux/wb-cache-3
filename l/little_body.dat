2500|$|They {{are very}} adept jumpers, and fences meant to contain them {{must be more}} than five feet (1.52 metres) high, six feet (1.82 metres) or higher being preferable. Because they are such good jumpers, they are well suited to the sport of dog agility. They are often {{classified}} as sighthounds, and thus compete in lure coursing. Because they maintain very <b>little</b> <b>body</b> fat and have short coats, they are sensitive to cold and cannot be left outside for long in cold climates. [...] Dog coats/jackets are a must for this breed in cold climates. Many Pharaoh Hounds enjoy snow, however, and will keep themselves warm through running, playing, and digging.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) {{sponsored}} a consensus panel whose recommendations {{have set the}} [...] standard for consideration of surgical treatment, the body mass index (BMI).

In healthy adults, BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9, with a BMI above 30 being considered obese, and a BMI less than 18.5 considered underweight.

50|$|Mangrove trees grow {{directly}} out of the water; {{when their}} seeds are ripe they fall from the tree and grow roots {{as soon as they}} touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they might fall in soil instead of water and start growing right where they fell. If the water level is high, however, they can be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees often make little islands as dirt and other things collect in their roots, making <b>little</b> <b>bodies</b> of land.|$|R
