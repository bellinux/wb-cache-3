40|$|Abstract. <b>Laminate</b> <b>floor</b> coverings, with {{fiberboard}} in {{the middle}} layer, are hygroscopic which caused potential dimension instability. The paper tested thickness swelling (TS) and water absorption (WA) of 10 commercial <b>laminate</b> <b>floors</b> (LF) according to G/T 18102 - 2007 (GB/T) and LY/T 1611 - 2011 (LY/T) and analyzed correlation between them. The results show that TS obtained by the GB/T method differed significantly from LY/T methods at the initial 14 days. 7 d-TS and 7 d-WA values of test specimen measuring 50 by 50 mm both correlated well with internal bond (IB). For both kinds of test methods, the moisture content almost reached saturation at 28 days...|$|R

40|$|Wood is {{generally}} {{associated with being}} practical, aesthetic and economy-friendly. Using wood in interior settings also can be based on psychological expectations and assumptions, as wood is attributed as warmer, more homely, more relaxing and more inviting. However, when investigating psychological differences, wood is usually compared to carpets, glass, leather, stone, or plastic but is not compared to a visually similar material such as laminate. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze and compare the various psychological characteristics related to wooden and laminate materials in interior settings. The experimental design was a 2 × 2 design (material, sequence) with repeated measures for material. Forty participants were asked to evaluate a framed piece of wood floor and a framed piece of <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> regarding technical, practical, and psychological aspects. Further, three questions about one’s purchase decision were asked. The results show that the wooden floor was evaluated significantly better than the <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> regarding “materials and processing”, “atmosphere”, and “values and symbolic functions”. For the criterion “health”, a tendency in favor of wood could be found.

In this study commercially manufactured high density fiberboard (HDF) based laminated samples were exposed to a sequence of 2 hrs, 24 hrs and 15 days water soaking test. Internal bond (IB) strength from 2 in by 2 in by 0. 25 in samples was determined at each exposure level. All of the failures took place in the core layer of the specimens. Based on initial results of this work IB strength of the samples reduced from an average value of 340 psi to 300 psi as a result of 2 -hr water exposure. When the samples were kept in water for 24 hrs and 15 days their IB strength reduction was not substantial.

40|$|Summary This research, {{based on}} the theory of market structure, is {{intended}} to discuss the market structure in Taiwan wood flooring industry. To decide the market structure, the market concentration ratio method was introduced. Also, the factors of the entry barriers that will affect the market structure on wood flooring industry was examined. As a result, {{there are two types}} of wood floorings, solid and <b>laminated</b> wood <b>flooring</b> in Taiwan market. The sales volume of solid wood flooring are 2 million 637 thousand square meters and laminated are 1 million 815 thousand square meters in 1997. The solid wood flooring is mainly used in the residential area, and the <b>laminated</b> wood <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the public area. The characteristics of wood flooring considered by consumer are stability, shallow color and no defective. The solid wood flooring, two and three level of distribution channel are normally used. The <b>laminated</b> wood <b>flooring,</b> three level of distribution channel are normally used. As for the market structure analysis, the <b>laminated</b> wood <b>flooring</b> is identified as an oligopoly market. The market structure of solid wood flooring is a competitive market. 摘 要 本研究主要目的在於以市場的背景現況及市場結構理論，來探 討臺灣木質地板的市場結構形態。研究中透過實地調查瞭解市場的 現況，並以市場集中度衡量臺灣木質地板市場結構，同時以市場進 入障礙來檢視國內木質地板市場結構之變化。經由調查得知，臺灣 木質地板市場主要分為實木地板與銘木地板兩類。目前木質地板 1997 年的銷售量，實木地板約為 81 萬坪，銘木地板約為 55 萬坪。以使 用場所而言，實木地板多用於一般家庭，而銘木地板多用於公共場 所。而在材種選擇的偏好上，消費者主要以材質穩定性、材面色淺 均勻無缺點為選擇重點。在配銷通路上，實木地板為二階與三階的 通路，而銘木地板為三階的通路。另外以市場結構分析臺灣木銘木 地板市場為大型製造商所形成之寡占市場，具高規模經濟性，因此 有高的進入障礙，而獲利性高，不過風險比較大；實木地板市場為 小型經銷商組成之競爭性市場，市場進入障礙低，產品差異性亦低， 因此獲利性也較低，但風險則相對較穩定...|$|R
