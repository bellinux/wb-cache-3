25|$|The Skyfari was {{a popular}} gondola lift which transported {{visitors}} from the Zoo Center to the Asian Plaza, running over African Plains and several other popular exhibits at the zoo. The seasonal exhibit ran from April to October and rose between 60-100-feet in the air. With around 490,000 riders annually, the lift was the zoo's third most popular attraction after Congo Gorilla Forest and the Wild Asia Monorail. Despite its popularity, ticket sales were barely breaking even and maintenance costs led to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> On July 8, 2008, high winds and heat led {{to one of the}} cars derailing, which trapped the three dozen passengers for up to five hours. Due to this, along with heavy budget cuts, the lift was permanently closed in January 2009, after 30 years of operation.|$|E

500|$|In 1766 {{supercargo}} Johann Krause {{was probably}} the most experienced merchant trading in Madagascar, although he had been [...] "guilty of an earlier indiscretion in 1760", on the VOC ship Neptunus. To avoid the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> caused by captive Malagasy dying while at sea, Krause convinced Captain Muller, who was in his first command and was unwell at the time, to unshackle some of them and let them work on deck. Disease was spreading among the Malagasy in the unsanitary conditions below deck, and the ship's surgeon had reported that, while there were no suitable medicines on board, disease was spreading to the crew. Consequently, two days after the ship had left Madagascar, the crew released a [...] "large party of [...] " [...] from confinement, the men assisting the crew and the women providing entertainment by dancing and singing. The Malagasy Massavana and some others were set to controlling and taking care of the sails, which has been described as [...] "unheard of, and certainly against all [...] regulations". Allowing slaves into secure areas on deck was common practice on most European vessels, and VOC regulations did permit slaves to be released onto the deck from time to time, under careful supervision. But the chief concern was that slaves might jump overboard to escape, rather than that they might mutiny, despite a slave mutiny on the VOC ship Drie Heuvelen in 1753. That mutiny was quickly suppressed, but clearly it could happen again, making Captain Muller's agreement to the kind of release that occurred on Meermin [...] "appear all the more foolish." ...|$|E

2500|$|The main {{thrust of}} the church's policy on Slavery in early medieval Europe was to end the {{enslavement}} of previously free Christians. [...] Slaves who converted or were baptised as infants in slavery were not covered. [...] It was common practice, both {{in the ancient world}} and the Migration period societies which were Christianized, for captives in war, often including the whole population of captured cities, to be enslaved as war booty. [...] This remained acceptable to the Church in the case of non-Christian captives, but not for Christian ones. [...] Getting this principle accepted in Christian societies could take a matter of centuries; there was a great <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> for the military elites. [...] According to the Cambridge Economic History of Europe [...] "one of the finest achievements of Christian ethics was the enforcement of respect for this maxim , slowly to be sure, for it is still being recalled in England early in the eleventh century, {{but in the long run}} most effectively." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{the temple}} {{began to focus}} more on {{promoting}} an ethical lifestyle, using the five and eight precepts as a foundation. Nationwide people were encouraged to quit drinking and smoking through a campaign called The Lao Phao Buri ( [...] , literally: 'throw away alcohol and burn cigarettes'), cooperating with other religious traditions. This project led the World Health Organization (WHO) to present a World No Tobacco Day award to Luang Por Dhammajayo on 31 May 2004. Over two hundred The Lao Phao Buri ceremonies were held, involving literally the pouring away of alcoholic beverages and the burning of cigarettes. The ceremonies were later to become a model of practice in schools and government institutions. The temple's campaign was carried to new heights when in 2005 the beverage company Thai Beverage announced to publicly list in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history. Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, two thousand monks of the temple organized a chanting of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to pressurize them to decline Thai Beverage's initial public offering. In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was soon followed suit by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement, holding their protest as well. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined, belonging to several religions. The organizations officially asked Prime Minister Thaksin's cooperation to stop the company, in what some of the protest leaders described as [...] "a grave threat to the health and culture" [...] of Thai society. While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economical benefits of this first local listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange, as Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, and the Stock Exchange chief resigned because of the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the current state}} of soil contamination in Ukraine and valid method <b>of</b> determining <b>loss</b> from contamination. Losses from soil contamination can be direct and indirect ones. Direct losses, on the total, characterize reduction of consumer’s cost of land as a tool and object <b>of</b> labour. Indirect <b>losses</b> are predefined by decline in yield of agricultural crops on contaminated soils, worsened quality of products, increase in unit-cost of contaminated produce through increased per cent of semi-fixed expenditures due to reduced crop productivity. A scientific and methodical approach to the assessment of internal ecological and economic <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> agricultural enterprises from soil contamination isgrounded. Basic criteria to determinate internal ecological and economical losses from soils’ contamination are <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> whose obtaining is the main goal of the enterprise performance in marketing conditions. Major constituents of internal ecological and economical loss incurred by an agrarian enterprise are: <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> due to obtaining less products than expected, because of shortage of crop yield through contamination <b>of</b> soils; <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> due to deteriorated qualityof agricultural produce through contamination <b>of</b> soils; <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> enterprise <b>profits</b> due to increase of product unit-cost through declined labour productivity, predefined by reduction of crop-yield productivity at the same rates of semi-fixed expenditures.
