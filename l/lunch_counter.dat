5|$|When {{service from}} Union Station was inaugurated in 1928, both {{eastbound}} and westbound trains were departing the station almost every hour bound for destinations across the United States. Passengers in the station's expansive waiting room could patronize its news stand, telegraph office, barber shop, shoeshine stand, or its <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> and soda fountain. Train schedules were handwritten {{on a large}} blackboard, while station staff announced the arrival and impending departures of the trains by megaphone.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned <b>lunch</b> <b>counter,</b> the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, in {{imitation}} of the nationally famous sit-ins at a Woolworth's <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> in Greensboro, North Carolina, black students and sympathizers {{held a series of}} sit-ins at the <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> of the Tallahassee Woolworth's. At least one white student from FSU was expelled for participating. The sit-ins were unsuccessful (Woolworth's desegregated nationally in 1962), and helped segregationist governor Farris Bryant win election later in 1960.|$|E
50|$|In many towns, the sit-ins were {{successful}} in achieving the desegregation of <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> and other public places. Nashville's students, who were already planning their sit-ins and started them {{a few days after}} the Greensboro group, attained desegregation of the downtown department store <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> in May, 1960.|$|R

Weingarten operated two types of food establishments: stores with <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> and lobby food operations. [...] Weingarten's purported policy was to allow employees at stores with <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> a free <b>lunch,</b> but employees at lobby food operations were not allowed a free lunch; this distinction (and what the actual policy was) would figure in the controversy to follow.|$|R

5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown <b>lunch</b> <b>counters.</b> At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|R
5|$|On May 10, six {{downtown}} stores {{opened their}} <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> to black customers {{for the first}} time. The customers arrived in groups {{of two or three}} during the afternoon and were served without incident. At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old boycott of the downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the South to begin desegregating its public facilities.|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s, as {{a result}} of {{successful}} local sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement, the Woolworth's Store in Lexington ended practices of segregation at its <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> and in restrooms. This was part of an era of activist efforts to achieve integration. Due to demographic and economic changes, Woolworth went out of business in 1990. Built in 1946 by architect Frederick W. Garber, the historic building was demolished in 2004. The site was paved for a parking lot.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{interior}} trim is original, such as tiled floor and wainscoting in turquoise and black, cream enameled walls, a laminated counter with 16 stools and a back wall with ribbed metal covering for all the kitchen functions. These treatments are more utilitarian, more typical of a <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> than a lushly-furnished rail diner of the era. The rear wing has some open dining space with freestanding tables and chairs, plus restrooms with their original doors.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{contentious}} issue {{erupted in the}} Summer of 1960, when several black students from Knoxville College initiated a series of sit-ins to protest segregation at downtown-area <b>lunch</b> <b>counters.</b> [...] With {{the backing of the}} Chamber of Commerce, Duncan formed a Good Will Committee, which encouraged downtown businesses to integrate their <b>lunch</b> <b>counters.</b> By July 1960, most downtown businesses had done away with their policies of segregation.

The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both <b>lunch</b> <b>counters,</b> the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|R
25|$|During {{the later}} years of Morrison's administration, {{and for the}} {{entirety}} of Schiro's, the city was a center of the Civil Rights Movement. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was founded there, and <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> sit-ins were held in Canal Street department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). When six-year-old Ruby Bridges integrated William Frantz Elementary School in the Ninth Ward, {{she was the first}} child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.|$|E
25|$|Titche-Goettinger {{remained}} the largest tenant until 1929, when it {{moved to the}} larger Titche-Goettinger Building two blocks east. The Wilson building's office space was renovated to provide accommodations for medical offices, an arcade was constructed to connect Elm Street and Main Street entrances. The W.A. Green department store moved into the tower space formerly occupied by Titche-Goettinger, while the H.L. Green Variety Store moved into the lower floors of the main building. When W.A. Green moved out in 1961, H.L. Green took over that space as well. The store became a fixture in downtown Dallas for several decades, and its <b>lunch</b> <b>counter</b> was the city's first to be integrated during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the <b>lunch</b> <b>counters</b> in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should.

This sit-in movement spread throughout the southern states, leading in many communities to progress toward desegregation, and increasing political pressure on the federal government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 made segregation of public accommodations illegal. As a rabbi in the deep South, he did not hesitate to speak out against racial discrimination in the workplace, even when the employers were Jewish.|$|E
25|$|It has {{two major}} public {{research}} universities, North Carolina A State University, a historically black college {{established in the}} late 19th century, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963. In the 21st century, the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science, on which the city hopes to build a new economy.|$|E
25|$|While one {{can easily}} graze one's way through the Market food stalls and shops, the Pike Place Market offers {{numerous}} other eating (and drinking) options. The once endemic workingmen's and sailors' taverns are gone; at roughly opposite corners of the Market, the Virginia Inn (founded as Virginia Bar, approximately 1908; operated as a cardroom during Prohibition, then Virginia Inn; passed into current management 1980 and slowly gentrified) and Place Pigalle (originally Lotus Inn, name dates from 1950s, remodeled 1982) retain their names, but both have gone upmarket. The Athenian Inn in the Main Market traces its history back to a 1909 bakery and is a relatively ungentrified bar and restaurant. Three Girls Bakery dates back to 1912 {{and may have been}} the first Seattle business started by women. While it is not in its original Corner Market location, no longer bakes on premises, and its current owner Jack Levy is a man, it still sells a vast variety of baked goods, does a brisk business in takeaway sandwiches, and has an old-style <b>lunch</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E

500|$|Since {{the first}} section of the highway was built through a rural part of the state, food or {{gasoline}} was not easily available to motorists. Because of this, the commission decided to provide service plazas at [...] intervals. The plazas would be constructed of native fieldstone, resembling Colonial-era architecture. In 1940, Standard Oil of Pennsylvania was awarded a contract for ten Esso service stations along the turnpike. Eight of the service plazas would consist of service stations and a restaurant, while the plazas at the halfway point (in Bedford) would be larger. The South Midway service plaza (the largest) contained a dining room, <b>lunch</b> <b>counter,</b> lounge and lodging for truckers; a tunnel connected it to the smaller North Midway plaza. The remaining service plazas were smaller, with a <b>lunch</b> <b>counter.</b> Food service at the plazas was provided by Howard Johnson's.
