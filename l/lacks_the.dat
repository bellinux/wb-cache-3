40|$|Abstract. Cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> Dictyostelium 34, 000 -D actin-bundling protein, a calcium-regulated actin {{crosslinking}} protein, {{were created}} to probe the function of this polypeptide in living cells. Gene replacement vectors were constructed by inserting either the UMP synthase or hygromycin resistance cassette into cloned 4 -kb genomic DNA containing sequences encoding the 34 -kD protein. After transformation and growth under appropriate selection, cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> protein were analyzed by PCR analyses on genomic DNA, Northern blotting, and Western blotting. Cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> 34 -kD protein were obtained in strains derived from AX 2 and AX 3. Growth, pinocytosis, morphogenesis, and expression of developmentally regulated genes is normal in cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> 34 -kD protein. In chemotaxis studies...|$|R

5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|According to the authors, {{the only}} Lepiota bearing a close {{resemblance}} to L.babruzalka is L.roseoalba, an edible mushroom described by Paul Christoph Hennings in 1891.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a {{critique}} of behavioural economics or nudging {{as a basis for}} practical policy making purposes. While behavioural economics operates as a plausible critique of standard neoclassical economics, it suffers from the same methodological errors inherent within that tradition. Just as socialist planners <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> information (and incentives) to allocate resources across an entire economy and economists <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> information to optimally correct externalities, so too libertarian paternalists <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> information to second guess consumer preferences and opportunity costs...|$|R

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E

5|$|Hiroyuki Okiura, the {{character}} designer and key animation supervisor, designed a more mature and serious Motoko than Masamune Shirow's original portrayal of {{the character}} in the manga.

The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} the genus Lactarius are also similar: The {{tropical}} African Lactarius chromospermus has a superficial resemblance to L.volemus, but the former species, {{in addition to its}} African distribution, can be identified by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the Russulaceae. Lactarius subvelutinus is also similar to L.volemus, but <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.|$|E

Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E

The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs.

He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> legal tools to do anything.
