25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte focusing screen (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical viewfinder eyepiece (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Nikon {{announced}} the Nikon D1. The D1's body {{was similar to}} Nikon's professional 35mm film SLRs, and it had the same Nikkor <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> allowing the D1 to use Nikon's existing line of AI/AIS manual-focus and AF lenses. Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior, the D1 was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak's then-undisputed reign over the professional market.|$|E
25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E
50|$|When used on {{a digital}} crop body with a field of view {{compensation}} factor of 2× (Four Thirds body), it provides a field of view equivalent to a 100 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> in a 35 mm body. In a 1.6× body, such as the Canon EOS 7D, it provides a narrower field of view, equivalent to an 80 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.5× body such as the Nikon D300, it provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 75 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.3× body such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III, it provides an even less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 65 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body.|$|R
5000|$|Lenses are not labeled or sold {{according}} to their angle of view, but rather by their focal length, usually expressed in millimeters. But this specification is insufficient to compare lenses for different cameras because field of view also depends on the sensor size. For example, a 50 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Nikon D3 (a full-frame camera) provides approximately the same field of view as a 32 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Sony α100 (an APS-C camera). Conversely, the same lens can produce different fields of view when mounted on different cameras. For example, a 35 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Canon EOS 5D (full-frame) provides a slightly wide-angle view, while the same <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Canon EOS 400D (APS-C) provides a [...] "normal" [...] or slightly telephoto view.|$|R
50|$|When used on {{a digital}} crop body with a field of view {{compensation}} factor of 1.6x, such as the Canon EOS 450D, it provides a narrower field of view, equivalent to an 240mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.5x body such as the Nikon D300 It provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to an 225mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.3x body such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III It provides an even less narrow field of view, equivalent to an 195mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body.|$|R
2500|$|After {{one more}} {{unsuccessful}} camera (Zenit-16) which {{was produced in}} very small quantities, in 1979 production of the Zenit-19 began. This was a camera with an original electromagnet-driven focal-plane shutter, M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> and shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000. [...] X-sync at 1/60 or 1/125 (camera was modified during production). The camera has only manual shooting mode (with a TTL-meter and a needle indicator of the proper exposition in the viewfinder). The Zenit-19 was, perhaps, the top-of-the-line Soviet M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> camera.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} lenses, {{to select the}} best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialised lenses, {{is one of the}} key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs (also known as [...] "Glass") are built to operate correctly with a specific <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> to be used on a camera body with a different <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> but with often reduced functionality.|$|E

2500|$|Many lenses are mountable, [...] "diaphragm-and-meter-compatible", {{on modern}} DSLRs and on older film SLRs {{that use the}} same <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> However, when lenses {{designed}} for 35mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens {{appears to have a}} longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full frame sensors or 35mm film because of the smaller imaging circle and, with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the reflex mirrors on full-frame bodies.|$|E
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the system is the EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which {{replaced}} the previous FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which mainly supported only manual-focus lenses.|$|E
50|$|Canon FL {{refers to}} a <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{standard}} for 35mm single-lens reflex cameras from Canon. It was introduced in April 1964 with the Canon FX camera, replacing the previous Canon R <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> It was in turn replaced in 1971 by the Canon FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> FL lenses {{can also be used}} on FD-mount cameras.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{interchangeable}} <b>lens</b> <b>mounts</b> {{on the market}} today include the Canon EF, EF-S and EF-M autofocus <b>lens</b> <b>mounts,</b> the Nikon F manual and autofocus mounts, the Olympus/Kodak Four Thirds and Olympus/Panasonic Micro Four Thirds digital-only mounts, the Pentax K mount and autofocus variants, the Sony Alpha mount (derived from the Minolta mount) and the Sony E digital-only mount.|$|R

50|$|Canon, Minolta (Sony), Olympus, {{and other}} {{manufacturers}} have changed lens mounts. Much older Canon film cameras used the FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which was discontinued in 1987 {{in favor of}} the EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> Olympus discontinued the OM <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for the OM series cameras {{in favor of the}} Four Thirds System <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> However, due {{to the size of the}} Four Thirds mount it is possible to fit legacy SLR lenses from any manufacturer using an adapter, albeit with manual aperture and focus control. Minolta (Sony after 2006) phased out its bayonet-mount MC and MD Rokkor lenses for a modified bayonet mount (supporting autofocus) in 1985.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} issue for compatibility between cameras and lenses. There is no universal standard for lens mounts, and each major camera maker typically uses its own proprietary design, incompatible with other makers. A few older manual focus <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> designs, such as the Leica M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for rangefinders, M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for early SLRs, and the Pentax K mount are found across multiple brands, but this is not common today. A few mount designs, such as the Olympus/Kodak Four Thirds System mount for DSLRs, have also been licensed to other makers. Most large-format cameras take interchangeable lenses as well, which are usually mounted in a lensboard or on the front standard.|$|E
5000|$|Like Zunow, Yashica {{found it}} {{difficult}} to gain market acceptance with its proprietary SLR <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> and redesigned its SLR camera line in 1962 to accept the Contax/Praktica M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> [...] The new SLR camera was introduced as the Penta J.|$|E
50|$|The lens is {{designed}} for digital crop DSLR with an APS-C sized sensor. Because of this, if the lens is used on a non-crop body, such as a Nikon D700, it will cause significant mechanical vignetting. When used on a body with a field of view compensation factor of 2x (Four Thirds body) it provides a field of view equivalent to a 36-100mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> in a 35mm body.
