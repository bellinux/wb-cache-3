5|$|Heading {{east from}} Devizes the canal {{passes through the}} Wiltshire {{countryside}} {{and a series of}} <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> swing bridges before another flight of locks at Crofton.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{has been}} studied for many years with {{exploration}} and restoration work being undertaken in Wellow and elsewhere. Particular effort, so far unsuccessful, has been put into {{trying to find the}} site of the second and third caisson locks at Combe Hay. In October 2006 a grant of £20,000 was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Somersetshire Coal Canal Society in association with Bath & North East Somerset Council and the Avon Industrial Buildings Trust to carry out a technical study on one of the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> associated structures at Combe Hay. Many of the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> associated workings are listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of caisson <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> when this failed an inclined plane trackway and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E

5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
5|$|The canal became disused after 1898 and officially {{closed in}} 1902, being sold {{off to the}} various railway {{companies}} who were expanding their networks. The land bordering the canal route was then used {{for a few years}} to construct a railway. In October 2006 a grant was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a technical study on one of the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> its associated structures at Combe Hay.|$|E

5|$|The {{stretch of}} canal from Sharpness to Purton runs {{very close to}} the river. At a high spring tide they were {{separated}} by little more than the width of the towpath. The canal also has no <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> bridges in Hungerford, {{including}} one which carries the A338. Hungerford Marsh Lock is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal {{in that it}} has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} {{into the}} town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes wide with auxiliary left turn lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), {{which leads to the}} East Windsor town center. About half a mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River {{into the town}} of Windsor <b>Locks</b> <b>and</b> Bradley International Airport.|$|E

5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|For {{over three}} centuries during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) China {{experienced}} sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of technological innovation. Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal.|$|E

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{to make the}} river suitable for coasters began in 1856, when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer. He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900, a programme {{which was designed to}} ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers, and which ensured its profitability. The 12 locks of the 1830s were replaced by five much larger <b>locks,</b> <b>and</b> most of the bridges were replaced by swing bridges, which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks {{on the lower}} Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the lower Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the California {{sea lion}} is {{protected}} {{on the federal}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal. In 1994 {{an amendment to the}} Act allowed for the possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should the level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact on the decline or recovery of ESA-listed salmonids. Applications have been granted for removal of several individual sea lions at Ballard <b>Locks</b> <b>and</b> at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period.|$|E

The lock will be demolished <b>and</b> Olmsted <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam will replace it.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury, the USACE dredged {{channels}} and built <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> levees in the Willamette's watershed. Although products such as lumber were often transported on an existing network of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, feeding the city's growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 1979: The Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado, an {{extremely}} destructive F4 tornado, {{one of the}} worst in Connecticut history, killed three and injured 500 in northern Hartford County. The tornado struck without warning, tearing through Bradley International Airport, destroying more than a dozen airplanes, and narrowly missing a Boeing 727 which was attempting to land. About 100 homes were completely leveled. Most of the $200+ million in damage was done in Windsor <b>Locks</b> <b>and</b> Suffield. This was the sixth-most damaging tornado in US history.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the canal, navigation between the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton was possible by using the River Parrett and the River Tone. The Tone had been improved by its Conservators, who had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1699 and 1707, which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the Parrett, and to build <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> half-locks to manage the water levels. The initial work was completed by 1717, although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century.|$|E
