5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} a <b>lovely</b> ovation {{from their}} supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a <b>lovely</b> clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren {{was officially}} described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, {{and was at}} first considered a colour variant of the superb fairywren. The scientific name commemorates the British collector Aylmer Bourke Lambert. It is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus it belongs {{to a group of}} four very similar species known collectively as the chestnut-shouldered fairywrens. The other three species are localised residents in restricted regions of Australia: the <b>lovely</b> fairywren (M. amabilis) of Cape York, the red-winged fairywren (M. elegans) of the southwest corner of Western Australia, and the blue-breasted fairywren (M. pulcherrimus) of southern Western Australia and the Eyre Peninsula. A 2011 analysis by Amy Driskell and colleagues of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found that the <b>lovely</b> fairywren was nested within the variegated fairywren complex, and was the sister taxon of the purple-backed subspecies assimilis.|$|E
