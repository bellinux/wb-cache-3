5|$|BBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records {{each year}} (when {{it was first}} set up, the figure was around 200 per year). Of these, {{approximately}} 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great snipe, gyrfalcon, gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic <b>little</b> <b>shearwater.</b> Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are incorrectly accepted, and 5% are incorrectly rejected.|$|E
25|$|When {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} {{are taken into}} account, the tropical birds overwhelmingly dominate. The islands {{are one of the}} most important breeding sites for tropical seabirds in Australia and have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). They contain by far the largest colonies of wedge-tailed shearwater in the eastern Indian Ocean, with over a million breeding pairs recorded there in 1994. They also contain Western Australia's only breeding colonies of the lesser noddy, and the largest colonies in Western Australia of the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater,</b> white-faced storm petrel, common noddy, Caspian tern, crested tern, roseate tern and fairy tern. In addition, they contain important breeding areas for the Pacific reef heron, Pacific gull, bridled tern, white-bellied sea eagle and osprey.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20â€“22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic <b>little</b> <b>shearwater</b> (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{classified}} as an Important Bird Area {{because it has}} been reported as supporting over 1% of the world's breeding population of flesh-footed shearwaters (6000-8000 pairs) and great-winged petrels (10,000-15,000 pairs). Other birds that are found on the island include wedge-tailed <b>shearwaters,</b> <b>little</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> Caspian terns and Pacific gulls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports {{a high proportion of}} the nesting population of flesh-footed shearwaters (with up to 300,000 breeding pairs) and has supported relatively high numbers of breeding fairy terns. [...] Other birds recorded breeding on the island are <b>little</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> sooty oystercatchers and silver gulls.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Little</b> <b>Shearwaters,</b> Puffinus assimilis assimilis, {{were thought}} to have {{disappeared}} from Lord Howe Island during the early 1900 s. This study reports <b>Little</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> breeding on Lord Howe Island between 1990 and 2001. A survey in 2000 recorded 85 nestlings. It is unclear whether this species has persisted on Lord Howe Island in low numbers throughout last century {{or whether it is}} recolonising. Adults, ashore between April and October, often occupied burrows previously used by Black-winged Petrels, Pterodroma nigripennis. Observations at a single nest showed the incubation period to be 55 days and the nestling period to be 72 days. Chick mass increased at a mean rate of 5. 2 g day" 1 to a maximum of 272 g at 48 days old. The chick fledged on 5 November at 158 g after fasting for six days. During chick rearing, parents came ashore almost nightly, arriving just after sunset and remaining with the chick until shortly before dawn; occasionally they were ashore during the day...|$|R
50|$|The subantarctic shearwater is {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater.</b>|$|E

50|$|Audubon's shearwater {{belongs to}} the Puffinus sensu stricto group of mid-sized and small shearwaters, which {{is related to the}} genus Calonectris. The {{taxonomy}} of this species is extremely confusing. It is occasionally listed as a subspecies of P. assimilis (the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater),</b> but they {{do not appear to be}} that closely related. Rather, P. lherminieri seems to belong to an ill-resolved clade also including such species as the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater,</b> the Manx shearwater (P. puffinus) or the black-vented shearwater (P. opisthomelas).|$|E
5000|$|The {{island is}} a {{breeding}} site for {{large numbers of}} black-winged and white-necked petrels.

50|$|Apart from a short {{stretch of}} its west coast, {{the island is}} bordered by cliffs, making access from the sea difficult. It is rugged and rocky, with little woody {{vegetation}}. Between the two high points of the island is a central valley where the vegetation {{is dominated by the}} sedge Cyperus ustulatus, while the surrounding slopes are dominated by a mix of Parietaria debilis and Disphyma australe. The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds. Seabirds breeding on the island include Kermadec and black-winged petrels, Kermadec <b>little</b> <b>shearwaters</b> and sooty terns.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>shearwater</b> usually {{produces}} {{a clutch of}} one clear white egg, measuring around 51 by 35 mm. The egg is incubated for 52 to 58 days by both sexes.|$|E

50|$|Heinroth's shearwater (Puffinus heinrothi) is {{a poorly}} known seabird {{in the family}} Procellariidae. Probably a close {{relative}} of the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater</b> or Audubon's shearwater (with which it is sometimes considered conspecific), it is distinguished by a long and slender bill and a brown-washed underside.|$|E
50|$|It was {{previously}} considered conspecific with the <b>little</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus assimilis) of the Southern Hemisphere. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequence analysis (Austin et al., 2004) indicates, however, that baroli and boydi {{are very close}} to the nominate subspecies of Audubon's shearwater. Whether the morphological distinctness and the non-overlapping ranges, or the genetic similarity are considered to be more significant is a matter of opinion, and the taxonomic status of these birds remains equivocal. Although some institutions (such as BirdLife International) retain the forms baroli and boydi within <b>little</b> <b>shearwater,</b> this is as a result of inaccurate lumping in the past, and is not supported by modern evidence. The British Ornithologists' Union has accepted P. baroli as a distinct species (Sangster et al. 2005), as has Clements Checklist. The American Ornithologists' Union followed in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The lava shearwater (Puffinus olsoni), or Olsons shearwater, was {{a species}} of shearwater that bred on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands.

50|$|It can be {{confused}} with the Manx shearwater (P. puffinus), which has white undertail coverts and in direct comparison a longer bill. Other similar-looking species are usually completely allopatric, though the largely subantarctic <b>little</b> <b>shearwater</b> (P. assimilis) may occasionally range into waters where P. lherminieri is normally found. It has more white on the face and underwing, a smaller bill and greyish-blue feet.|$|E
50|$|The uplands are {{primarily}} pasture-land and agricultural areas, {{with most of}} the region taken-up by rural activities. Tourists visiting the area are attracted by the diversity of migratory and maritime bird species that nest in the cliffs of the point, including the migratory Corey's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and <b>Little</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus assimilis), but also the Roseate (Sterna dougallii) and Common Terns (Sterna hirundo).|$|E
50|$|Certain {{populations are}} known {{variously}} as Baillon's shearwater, tropical shearwater, Bannerman's shearwater, Mascarene shearwater and Persian shearwater; {{some of these}} are considered distinct species by various authors.
