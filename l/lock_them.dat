5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to <b>lock</b> <b>them</b> both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E

The railroads began hiring replacement workers (strikebreakers), which increased hostilities.

This added racial tension to the union's predicament.|$|E

As Larry starts the playback {{of one of the}} DVDs, Sally discovers she can converse with the Doctor in the past, as he possesses a copy of the complete transcript that is currently being compiled by Larry as he listens. The Doctor explains that he and Martha were transported to 1969 by the Weeping Angels. The Angels are [...] "quantum locked", allowing them to move unbelievably fast when unobserved, while they turn to near-indestructible stone when they are observed. As gazing upon themselves will permanently <b>lock</b> <b>them</b> in that form, the Angels otherwise cover their eyes, creating their [...] "weeping" [...] appearance. The Angels feed on the potential time energy generated when they transport their victims to the past, and the Doctor fears they are now seeking the TARDIS' vast reserves of time energy.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{views on}} the shapes and connectivity of atoms was that proposed by Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus who reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded {{to the shape of}} the atoms involved. [...] Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that <b>lock</b> <b>them</b> into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. [...] It was Democritus that was the main proponent of this view. [...] Using analogies based on the experiences of the senses, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. [...] Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets (see diagram).|$|E
500|$|Wipeout Pulse was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). Colin Berry, the lead designer of the game, stated {{in an interview that}} the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure, and was willing to use parts of the feedback to [...] "help shape some elements of Pulse". According to Berry, some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence (AI) too advanced, whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted [...] "something more challenging to keep them coming back". The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition, which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure. In addition, the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time, in the event that they [...] "got stuck". Reflecting on this, Berry said: [...] "We want the people who buy it, to see all the game, {{we do not want to}} <b>lock</b> <b>them</b> out".|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] was filmed in Buftea, Romania by Iulian Moga on 1 November 2010. The clip was uploaded onto YouTube on 14 November 2010. A behind-the-scenes video was previously aired in November 2010 by Romanian television Music Channel. Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] {{as one of}} Stan's best clips ever. The video begins with scenes of police officers bringing a handcuffed Stan into a room of a police station to interrogate her along with two of her female friends. When {{she and her friends}} refuse to give the police any information, they <b>lock</b> <b>them</b> in a jail cell. Stan coaxes and successfully seduces the guard, while her friends steal his police equipment before locking him inside the cell and escaping. The group enters a dressing room where they find police outfits and disguise themselves as officers. They locate the chief's office and hold the police chief and other workers at gun point while duct-taping their mouths and hands to the chief's desk. Stan and her friends exit the office and walk inconspicuously through the front lobby and out of the building. Cut scenes show Stan dancing in her cell or her with her friends in police uniform.|$|E
