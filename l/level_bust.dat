50|$|The major instigators of {{the rally}} were Allen Cohen and artist Michael Bowen, {{the creators of}} the San Francisco Oracle, which first hit the streets in September 1966. The {{occasion}} was the banning of LSD, by the California legislature in Sacramento, an enactment which virtually created a neighborhood of outlaws in the Haight, where 'acid' was a staple of community culture. Since the new law was {{to go into effect}} on October 6, 1966, Cohen and others related the event to the number of the Beast of Revelation. On a more serious <b>level,</b> <b>busts</b> for drugs were ramping up locally and on the national level, and confrontations between the hippie communes and the local police were getting more intense and led to street protests and rioting, followed by neighborhood curfews. A better form of protest, more suited to hippie culture was needed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{numerous}} {{studies in the}} literature, urban planning norms have an important effect on housing prices. A large quantity of data and empirical studies focusing on building restrictions and housing prices refer to the American real estate market. The current study, instead, set out {{to examine the relationship}} between city-planning and the cost of housing in the Italian real estate market. While, however, recent studies carried out here have prevalently focused on the boom phase of the real estate cycle, the present study primarily probes the bust period. We used a multivariate regression model to analyze the effect of urban planning norms on housing (new and existing units) price variation. The model shows that in those localities where building regulations had permitted more buildings to be constructed during the boom phase, prices fell to deeper <b>level</b> during the <b>bust</b> one. These findings have implications with regard to the real estate crisis as well as to housing affordability policies here in Italy and elsewhere...|$|R
50|$|The tower has {{a square}} plan, {{it is about}} 21 m high, and 3 m on each side. It has {{recessed}} bow windows on three sides around the bottom. Above the window on the side facing King Street is a stone bust in a niche, and on the right face is a bronze relief, both of which depict Mrs Gaskell. At a higher <b>level</b> than the <b>bust</b> is an offset oriel window, and {{near the top of}} the tower are randomly projecting blocks. Near the summit of the tower is an arcade of windows. At the top is an open parapet and turret-like projections. The bust on the King Street face is a copy of a marble bust made in 1897 by Hamo Thornycroft, which is itself a copy of a plaster bust by David Dunbar, which was executed in about 1830-31. This was not present at the formal opening, but was in place by 1913. The sculptor of the relief was Achille d'Orsi. In 1898 Watt has placed it on the front of Knutsford post office, and it was later moved to the tower.|$|R
