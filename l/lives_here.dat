25|$|In Odisha, the Community of Christ has {{experienced}} significant growth {{since the first}} members were baptized in November 1965. The American leadership of the church including Apostle Charles D.

In this way, the church focused its teachings on physical and spiritual healing and well-being with the goal of improving people's <b>lives</b> <b>here</b> and now. In particular, the church has found success among the Sora people, oftentimes with whole villages converting to Christianity.

25|$|Alex {{returns to}} his parents' flat, {{only to find that}} they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for {{committing}} suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still <b>lives</b> <b>here,</b> but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape. He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.|$|E

2500|$|He {{continued}} to produce masterful portraits, both in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision; {{but with the}} departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome.
