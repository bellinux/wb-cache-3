5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including <b>line</b> <b>breeding</b> and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 499 non-waxy rice lines {{including}} 172 landraces (the landrace set) and 327 cultivars and <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> (the <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set) {{were used to}} study the genetic diversity of starch physicochemical properties, and {{the differences between the}} landrace set and the <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set were compared. All the rice lines were planted in the same season and at the same location in Hainan province. Wide diversities of starch physicochemical properties were found, e. g. apparent amylose content ranged from 7. 9 % to 33 % in normal rice and up to 39. 8 % in an amylose extender mutant; peak viscosity ranged from 90. 1 to 305. 4 RVU, hot paste viscosity from 77. 5 to 248. 1 RVU, and cold paste viscosity from 111. 4 to 412. 6 RVU; gel hardness ranged from 9. 4 to 61. 1 g. The <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set had a wider range of physicochemical properties than the landrace set with a rare exception in gel hardness. The mean values of nearly all the parameters showed {{significant differences between the two}} sets of rice except for the setback ratio. The adhesiveness and cohesiveness of landrace starches were significantly lower than those of the <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> whereas the other parameters of the landrace set were higher than those of the <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set. Analysis of correlation among these parameters indicated that most of the traits were significantly correlated. The wide range of physicochemical properties among non-waxy rice lines allows breeders to obtain <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> with desirable grain quality and food processors to select unique rice materials for specialty food processing, in addition to the applications in other processing industries. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Vertag GmbH & Co. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

By adhering to this breeding strategy more stability will be created than with random crossing based on phenotype.|$|R

In infested field by O. foetida, the grain yield reduction ranged from 55. 7 to 83 % for the <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> compared to 97 % for the susceptible cultivar Badï. Lines L 6 and L 7 were the less affected by Orobanche parasitism considering severity, number of emerged Orobanche, and yield.

In Petri dish experiment, Orobanche germination reached the highest rates; 69. 9 and 59. 7 %, respectively, with O. crenata and O. foetida for Badï. For the <b>breeding</b> <b>lines,</b> it ranged from 6. 3 to 44. 9 % for O. crenata and from 4. 8 to 40. 8 % for O. foetida.

Wide diversity was found in all flour physicochemical properties, e. g. peak temperature (Tp) ranged from 63. 2 to 79. 8 °C, width at half peak height (ΔT 1 / 2) of gelatinization ranged from 4. 7 to 10. 5 °C; enthalpy of gelatinization (ΔHg) ranged from 5. 6 to 11. 4 J/g, and retrogradation percentage (R%) ranged from 0. 2 % to 54. 2 %. The <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set had a larger range of thermal properties and R% than in the landrace set, whereas the range of retrogradation enthalpy was similar between two sets. The mean for all parameters differed between the two sets; mean ΔT 1 / 2 of the landrace set was smaller than in the <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set, whereas other parameters were larger in the landrace set than the <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> set. Correlation analysis showed that apparent amylose content was positively correlated with ΔHg (r = 0. 65, P < 0. 001) and R% (r = 0. 68, P < 0. 001), and negatively correlated with ΔT 1 / 2 (r = - 0. 28, P < 0. 001). All thermal and retrogradation properties themselves were correlated; the correlation between ΔT 1 / 2 and all other parameters was negative, whereas all other pairs were positive. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
