50|$|At {{the level}} of the PIP joint the {{extensor}} mechanism splits into three bands. The central slip attaches to the dorsal tubercle of the middle phalanx near the PIP joint. The pair of <b>lateral</b> <b>bands,</b> to which contribute the extensor tendons, continue past the PIP joint dorsally to the joint axis. These three bands are united by a transverse retinacular ligament, which runs from the palmar border of the <b>lateral</b> <b>band</b> to the flexor sheath at {{the level of}} the joint and which prevents dorsal displacement of that <b>lateral</b> <b>band.</b> On the palmar side of the joint axis of motion, lies the oblique retinacular ligament Landsmeer which stretches from the flexor sheath over the proximal phalanx to the terminal extensor tendon. In extension, the oblique ligament prevents passive DIP flexion and PIP hyperextension as it tightens and pulls the terminal extensor tendon proximally.|$|R

30|$|The {{abnormal}} {{insertion of}} orbicularis oris muscle into base of columella in cleft lip creates unfavorable forces to pull columella and caudal nasal septum to the non-affected side. Furthermore, insertion of orbicularis oris muscle into the subalar cartilage forces the cleft {{side of the}} nose to retract laterally and inferiorly, which results in flattening of the <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> alar cartilage. Correction of these anatomic displacement is indispensable to restore normal nasal structure. It is bound up with dissecting, releasing, and repositioning of <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> alar cartilage from the margin of medial and lateral flaps {{on the base of}} nose.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the long-term effect of <b>lateral</b> <b>band</b> translocation for correcting swan neck deformity in patients with cerebral palsy at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Methods: Swan neck deformities of 62 fingers were corrected using a modified <b>lateral</b> <b>band</b> translocation. At 1 -year and 5 -year follow-up, any recurrence of hyperextension was recorded through nonconstrained evaluation. Active extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint beyond 0 degree was considered a recurrence. Results: Correction was successful for 84 % of the operated fingers at 1 -year follow-up. After 5 years, the success rate had decreased to 60 %. Furthermore, no relationship was found between any of the concomitant surgical procedures and the number of patients with recurrences. Conclusions: The long-term result of <b>lateral</b> <b>band</b> translocation is disappointing in our series, and it should not be advocated as a procedure with long-lasting success in patients with cerebral pals...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Several {{techniques}} {{can be performed}} to improve nasal tip definition such as cartilage resection, tip grafts, or sutures. Objective: To evaluate the outcome of lateral intercrural suture at the <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilage by endonasal rhinoplasty with a basic technique without delivery in decreasing the angle of domal divergence and improving the nasal tip definition. Method: This prospective study was performed in 64 patients in which a suture was made on the board head of the <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilage in the joint between the dome and lateral crus, using polydioxanone (PDS) with sharp, curved needle. Results: In all of the cases, better definition of the nasal tip was achieved by intercrural suturing for at least 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Lateral intercrural suture of the <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilage provides improved nasal tip definition and can be performed by endonasal rhinoplasty without delivery in the Caucasian nose...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Nasal alar {{retraction}} deformities occasionally {{require both}} soft tissue release and large cartilage grafts. The structure between the upper lateral cartilage and the lateral crus of the <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilage {{has been described}} as fibrous tissue, intercartilaginous ligament, ligament-like arrangement or connective tissue. Despite its importance, no anatomical and histological examination has been conducted on this structure. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the area between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilages by histological examination. Methods: Eleven hemi-facial human cadaver dissections were performed. Initially, the gross dissection of all specimens was conducted. The cutaneous-subcutaneous division of the skin was elevated and was removed. The upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilages were removed en bloc together with the area among these cartilages from six specimens and were divided from its midline. The obtained twelve specimens were fixed in formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. 4 &# 956;m sections were obtained. Other five specimens were examined to outline under a stereomicroscope. This approach allowed free access to the structure extending from the area between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilages to the skin. The full-thickness biopsy was taken from the structure extending from the area between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lateral</b> cartilages to the skin. All specimens were fixed in formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. 4 &# 956;m sections were obtained and prepared for microscopic examination. All the sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin, Mowry&# 8217;s colloidal iron, Verhoff&# 8217;s elastic stain, and Masson&# 8217;s trichrome stain for histological examination. The contents were determined. Results: A single dense longitudinal collagenous bundle between the cartilages and a structure extending from the area between the cartilages to the skin were found. Conclusion: The knowledge of this area in terms of anatomical and histological features will provide additional data for surgeons. [J Exp Integr Med 2013; 3 (1) : 57 - 61...|$|R
