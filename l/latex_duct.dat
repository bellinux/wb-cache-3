5000|$|Also called [...] "articulate <b>latex</b> ducts", these <b>ducts</b> or vecssels are {{the result}} of anastamosing of many cells together.They grow more or less as {{parallel}} ducts which by means of branching and frequent anastamose form a complex network.Latex vessels are commonly found in many angiosperm families Papaveraceae, Compositae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{called as}} [...] "non-articulate <b>latex</b> ducts", these <b>ducts</b> are {{independent}} units which extend as branched structures for long distances {{in the plant}} body.They originates as minute structures, elongate quickly and by repeated branching ramify in all directions but do not fuse together.Thus a network is not formed as in latex vessels.|$|R
40|$|Yellow latex is {{the main}} problem in {{mangosteen}} agribusiness, because it is one factor lowering the fruit quality. The structure of yellow <b>latex</b> secretory <b>ducts</b> in the flower and fruit {{as well as in}} the root, stem and leaf of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) seedling and the qualitative phytochemistry of yellow latex were studied. The ducts were branched, canal-like type. They were found in the exocarp, mesocarp, endocarp, aril of the fruit, flower, stem, and leaf. In the fruit, the biggest diameter of the secretory ducts was found in the endocarp. There were continuous secretory ducts from fruit stalk to the fruit. Ultrastructural observation showed that the ducts surrounded by specific epithelial cells, which were living cells containing dense cytoplasm with plastid, mitochondria and golgi apparatus organelles. The qualitative test indicated that the yellow latex collected from stem bark, outer part of fruit, young fruit pericarp, mature aril and young aril contained terpenoid, flavonoid and tannin, but not alkaloid, saponin and steroid, except in the young aril containing the steroid...|$|R
