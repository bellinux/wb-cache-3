5|$|During the interview, Kunichika {{claimed to}} have moved 107 times, but it seems more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> moved only ten times.|$|E
5|$|A Roman by birth, Honorius {{may have}} been one of those chosen by Pope Gregory the Great for the Gregorian mission to England, {{although}} it seems more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was a member of the}} second party of missionaries, sent in 601. It is not known if his name was given to him at birth or if he chose it when he became archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Felix Magennis, {{a member}} of the Magennis clan and {{relative}} of Hugh Magennis, Lord of Iveagh, built a castle next to the mouth of the Shimna River in 1588. The town is referred to as New Castle in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1433 so it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> built on the site of an existing structure. Magennis’ castle was demolished in 1830.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon it's oysters. There {{are some}} {{on the south side}} of the point, an' most <b>likely</b> <b>that's</b> how <b>he</b> has been fillin' up his time." ...|$|R
50|$|No {{record of}} what action Gratian took seems to have survived; but it seems <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> had taken none, Ambrose would have sent a reminder.|$|R
2500|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> had <b>he</b> lived, Lincoln {{would have}} {{followed}} a policy similar to Johnson's, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have clashed with congressional Radicals, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would {{have produced a}} better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes." ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, {{but it is very}} likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} that {{because of the lack of}} proper facilities in East Anglia, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E
5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.|$|E
5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead. It was also <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have received less salary playing at first.|$|E
30|$|That Ibn Hayyim refers here to azurite is <b>likely</b> given <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gives {{different}} instructions {{about how}} to temper lapis lazuli (ultramarine) in the next chapter, Ch. 7. See [18, p. 122].|$|R
5000|$|For the premiere, most <b>likely</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} be accused of [...] "formalism" [...] or [...] "elitism," [...] Shostakovich {{allegedly}} renamed the movements {{in the manner of}} a war story: ...|$|R
50|$|More <b>likely</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{revived the}} club around 1905 {{when he was}} a maths teacher and was a key driver in the club being {{accepted}} into the Scottish Rugby Union in 1911.|$|R
5|$|Robert died at Jumièges, but {{the date}} of his death is unclear. Various dates are given, with Ian Walker, the biographer of Harold arguing for between 1053 and 1055, but H. E. J. Cowdrey, who wrote Robert's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry, says on 26May in either 1052 or 1055. H. R. Loyn, another modern historian, argues that it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 1053.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of the Junta {{was the result of}} the high influence of the militias in general and Saavedra in particular in the local politics. From that time on, he spent most of his time at the fort of Buenos Aires, managing the government with Moreno, Belgrano and Castelli. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left his business for this.|$|E
5|$|Troglita's {{success in}} {{restoring}} peace to Africa {{can be seen}} from the fact that in late 551, when Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, captured Sardinia and Corsica, Troglita was able to spare enough forces and send a fleet to reclaim them, albeit without success. The exact date of Troglita's death is unknown, but it is most <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 552 or soon after.|$|E
5000|$|Fouquet {{would have}} greatly overshadowed the other hands {{in terms of}} stature, and it is thought <b>likely</b> <b>that,</b> given <b>he</b> is {{attributed}} with just five leaves, he was commissioned to [...] "dress up and personalise" [...] the book.|$|R
5000|$|Woods concludes <b>that</b> Stuart-Wortley was <b>likely</b> unaware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a pawn in {{a bigger}} game of {{personal}} politics {{being played out}} in the most senior ranks of the British Army, twelve days before Haig succeeded French.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the booklet}} in the Repertoire Records CD reissue {{of the album}} in 2001, Frampton and Dee Anthony {{recommended}} Armageddon to A&M Records, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> because <b>he</b> was their top selling artist at the time, they agreed to sign the band.|$|R
5|$|When Nicholas {{returned}} to Scotland, and {{the exact nature}} of his activities over the next few years, remain unclear matters. His episcopal rank makes it <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attended the parliaments and took part in the affairs of the kingdom {{during the early years of}} his episcopate, but direct proof is lacking.|$|E
5|$|About 1270, he {{returned}} to England to teach at Oxford, and was elected provincial minister of the Franciscans in England in 1275. He did not long remain in that post, being summoned to Rome as lector sacri palatii, or theological lecturer at the papal palace. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> composed his Expositio super Regulam Fratrum Minorum, a work that included information on preaching, a subject that Peckham felt was of great importance. In 1279 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Nicholas III who had prohibited the election of Robert Burnell, Edward I's preferred candidate. He was provided (appointed by the pope to the see) on 25 January 1279 and consecrated on 19 February 1279.|$|E
5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This may mean that Ecgric was a son of Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric {{to be the same}} person as Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, Rædwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|In Beast Wars: Transformers, Rampage is a mutant (or {{at least}} his spark is) Cybertronian science {{experiment}} due to his indestructible spark, of which is simply a replication of Starscream's own spark (most <b>likely</b> indicating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is also a mutant).|$|R
50|$|He is {{variously}} {{described as}} Baron Mattei, a Papal Marquis and Papal Army Field Marshal. It is more <b>likely,</b> though, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was simply a}} skilled military leader (militia leader) loyal to the papacy of Pope Urban VIII and then later Pope Innocent X.|$|R
50|$|Some historians {{believe that}} Tadakiyo could have, and should have, seen the entire affair {{to an end}} years earlier, and judge it <b>likely</b> {{therefore}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was taking bribes from Tsunamura's regents, who sought to draw out the situation and avoid any action being taken against them.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{visited the}} city {{in an attempt to}} gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{published}} no {{writings of}} his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the Abbey Square Sketch Book, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17thcenturies, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the Abbey Gateway in Chester.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{his only}} son, heir to the noble lordships of Mondolfo and Carmina. Was it <b>likely,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should {{sacrifice}} me willingly to the seclusion of the cloister, whilst our lordship passed {{into the hands of}} our renegade, guelphic cousin, Cosimo d'Anguissola of Codogno? ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, Merrells {{announced}} <b>that</b> it's most <b>likely</b> {{a possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{can return to}} Emmerdale to reprise his role as Declan Macey ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} Scipio will pursue us," [...] Hannibal said. [...] "A defeat here would be as fatal to him {{as it would be}} to us, and I think it more <b>likely</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> finds we have marched away north, he will return to his ships and meet us in Italy." ...|$|R
5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|However, {{both he and}} Australia {{suffered}} a surprising string of poor results in the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series, Gilchrist managing an average of only 22.20 during the tournament. Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches, but England won with two finals victories over the Australians. Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 {{in the first two}} matches but did not pass 30 thereafter. He was then rested for Australia's winless three-match ODI tour of New Zealand, before his selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Having previously indicated that it was highly <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would retire after the 2007 World Cup, he then stated a desire to play on aftwerwards.|$|E
50|$|He {{may have}} been a {{descendant}} of a Persian captive at the battle of Qadesiya who became a mawlā of the Qorashī clan of the Banu Amer b. Loʾayy. Some accounts, however, make the less <b>likely</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was of this clan, hence of pure Arab descent.|$|R
50|$|DioGuardi has {{successfully}} gained {{the nomination of}} the Right to Life party in the past, which requires their candidates to be strictly opposed to all forms of abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> loses the Republican primary he will stay in the race on this line.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.3 out of 10 and {{wrote in his}} verdict, [...] "Look, this show isn't strong {{enough for me to}} hold any acute {{objections}} to it tackling The Joker. Given the problems the series has at its core, Joker is not suddenly something I'm now demanding they 'do right.' But I am intrigued about how things are supposed to piece together for him. If Jerome was supposed to be Joker, then his origin story happened years ago when something made him snap. So it's very <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> just a random(ish) psycho (who the previews for the episode made sure to show us being psycho, thus ruining the entire murder mystery)." ...|$|R
