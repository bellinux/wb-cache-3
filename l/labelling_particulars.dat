40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} of feed are spread over several Directives according {{to the type of}} feed concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation of this feed in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles for feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use of feed materials. Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down the marketing conditions for certain products, belonging to the category feed materials, used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as of feed materials, dietetic feed, feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might not be used for food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between feed materials, feed additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On feed intended for particular nutritional purposes, the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication of feed materials incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw materials in compound feed that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further <b>labelling</b> <b>particulars</b> can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|E

5000|$|The abject is {{a concept}} that is often used to {{describe}} bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis. [...] Imogen Tyler sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had <b>labelled</b> <b>particular</b> groups of peoplemostly minority groupsas revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hierarchical proof trees (hiproofs for short) add {{structure}} to ordinary proof trees, by allowing portions of trees to be hierarchically nested. The additional structure {{can be used}} to abstract away from de-tails, or to <b>label</b> <b>particular</b> portions to explain their purpose. In this paper we present two complementary methods for capturing hiproofs in HOL Light, along with a tool to produce web-based visu-alisations. The first method uses tactic recording, by modifying tactics to record their arguments and construct a hierarchical tree; this allows a tactic proof script to be modified. The second method uses proof record-ing, which extends the HOL Light kernel to record hierachical proof trees alongside theorems. This method is less invasive, but requires care to manage the size of the recorded objects. We have implemented both methods, resulting in two systems: Tactician and HipCam. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} explores {{the realities of}} water {{provision}} in 'informal' urban spaces located {{in different parts of}} the world through eight empirical, case-based papers. The collection of articles shows that formality and informality are fluid concepts that say more about the authority to legitimate certain practices than describe the condition of that particular practice. In this introductory article we provide a historical overview that links the academic discussion on informality to urban water supply practices. Subsequently, we propose the concepts of disaggregation and co-production to describe how informality works, and how ideas about (in) formality are mobilised to <b>label</b> <b>particular</b> practices and service modalities. Disaggregation reveals that a single service delivery mechanism may incorporate activities, varying according to the degree to which they are formal or informal. Co-production describes a process where hybrid service provision modalities are produced as a result of the articulation of socio-political, economic, biophysical and infrastructural drivers. The article concludes by identifying a series of research directions that emerged as a result of producing this special issue...|$|R
