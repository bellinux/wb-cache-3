5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins in <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> made them {{very difficult for}} early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in <b>large</b> <b>quantities,</b> e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> of {{hydrogen and helium}} on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas could still be captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E

Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in <b>large</b> <b>quantities.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the Martian surface.|$|E
