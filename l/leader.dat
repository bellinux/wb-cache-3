30|$|Such {{research}} {{findings suggest that}} Indian <b>leaders</b> are affiliative <b>leaders,</b> who create emotional bonds and harmony.

30|$|Further {{analysis}} of the false SNA negatives did not yield much more insight. Within the three categories of <b>leaders</b> (current <b>leaders,</b> potential <b>leaders,</b> and both <b>leaders),</b> many of the false SNA negatives were in the both <b>leaders</b> category. Being categorized as both <b>leaders</b> may have been because respondents interacted less with those actors and thus were less sure how to categorize them. However, a non-trivial number were in the current <b>leaders</b> and potential <b>leaders</b> categories for each timestamp. Potential <b>leaders</b> may have had fewer ties because they were newer to change work or department. In the future, they may have enough ties to indicate they are <b>leaders.</b> However, it is curious why those perceived as current <b>leaders</b> would be false negatives. We assumed that actors who were perceived as current <b>leaders</b> would be active in teaching discussion.|$|R

40|$|Background: Opinion <b>leaders</b> {{represent}} one way {{to disseminate}} new knowledge and influence the practice behaviors of physicians. This study explored the stability of opinion <b>leaders</b> over time, whether opinion <b>leaders</b> were polymorphic (i. e., influencing multiple practice areas) or monomorphic (i. e., influencing one practice area), and reach of opinion <b>leaders</b> in their local network. Methods: We surveyed surgeons and pathologists in Ontario to identify opinion <b>leaders</b> for colorectal cancer in 2003 and 2005 and to identify opinion <b>leaders</b> for breast cancer in 2005. We explored whether opinion <b>leaders</b> for colorectal cancer identified in 2003 were re-identified in 2005. We examined whether opinion <b>leaders</b> were considered polymorphic (nominated in 2005 as opinion <b>leaders</b> for both colorectal and breast cancer) or monomorphic (nominated in 2005 for only one condition). Social-network mapping was used to identify the number of local colleagues identifying opinion <b>leaders.</b> Results: Response rates for surgeons were 41 % (2003) and 40 % (2005); response rates for pathologists were 42 % (2003) and 37 % (2005). Four (25 %) of the surgical opinion <b>leaders</b> identified in 2003 for colorectal cancer were reidentified in 2005. No pathology opinion <b>leaders</b> for colorectal cancer were identified in both 2003 and 2005.
