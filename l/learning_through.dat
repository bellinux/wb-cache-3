5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> the senses.|$|E

25|$|Experience {{was also}} a key element to {{learning}} for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of knowledge often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults; blindly obeying and lacking {{the ability to think}} on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> experience was superior to <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{systematically}} determine whether lowfunctioning autistic children [MA of approximately half of their CA or less] could <b>learn</b> <b>through</b> observation by the use of a peer modeling procedure. Since modeling is less structured than traditional one-on-one procedures, it was also thought that modeling might facilitate subsequent generalization of tasks <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> observation. Four autistic children were taught two receptive labeling tasks. One task was taught by a traditional trial and error procedure, while the other task was taught by a modeling procedure wherein the models were other autistic children. Results indicated that all four children <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> observation of their peer model. Additionally, generalization and maintenance of correct responding were superior when the children <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> observation rather than by trial and error. These results are discussed in terms of the modeling literature, generalization issues, and implications for designing teaching settings for autistic children...|$|R
