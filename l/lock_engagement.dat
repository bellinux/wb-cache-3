40|$|A {{releasable}} fastening apparatus is presented. The device {{includes a}} connecting member and a housing. The housing supports a gripping mechanism that {{is adapted to}} engage the connecting member. A triggering member is movable within the housing between a first position in which it constrains the gripping mechanism in <b>locked</b> <b>engagement</b> with the connecting member, and a second position in which the gripping mechanism is disengaged from the connecting member. A shaped memory alloy actuator is employed for translating the triggering member from its first to its second position.

40|$|A force {{transmitting}} load alleviator {{apparatus and}} method are provided for rotatably and pivotally driving a member {{to be protected}} against overload torsional and bending (moment) forces. The load alleviator includes at least one bias spring to resiliently bias cam followers and cam surfaces together and to maintain them in <b>locked</b> <b>engagement</b> unless a predetermined load is exceeded whereupon a center housing is pivotal or rotational {{with respect to a}} crown assembly. This pivotal and rotational movement results in frictional dissipation of the overload force by an energy dissipator. The energy dissipator can be provided to dissipate substantially more energy from the overload force than from the bias force that automatically resets the center housing and crown assembly to the normally fixed centered alignment. The torsional and bending (moment) overload levels can designed independently of each other...|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of fastener engagement. The nut has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are internally threaded, spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has detents on opposite sides which force the nut segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of the nut when moved out. When the nut is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} detents presses the nut segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the detents depressed to indicate positive <b>locking</b> <b>engagement</b> of the nut. On removal, counterclockwise rotation of the nut relieves the endwise pressure on the detents, permitting internal springs to force the detents outward and allowing the nut segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R

40|$|A {{quick connect}} {{fastener}} and {{method of use}} is presented wherein the quick connect fastener is suitable for replacing available bolts and screws, the quick connect fastener being capable of installation by simply pushing a threaded portion of the connector into a member receptacle hole, the inventive apparatus being comprised of an externally threaded fastener having a threaded portion slidably mounted upon a stud or bolt shaft, wherein the externally threaded fastener portion is expandable by a preloaded spring member. The fastener, upon contact with the member receptacle hole, has the capacity of presenting cylindrical threads of a reduced diameter for insertion purposes and once inserted into the receiving threads of the receptacle member hole, are expandable for engagement of the receptacle hole threads forming a quick connect of the fastener and the member to be fastened, the quick connect fastener can be further secured by rotation after insertion, {{even to the point}} of <b>locking</b> <b>engagement,</b> the quick connect fastener being disengagable only by reverse rotation of the mated thread engagement...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} mating fluid {{transfer}} couplings is constructed having a male connector which {{is provided with}} a pair of opposed rollers mounted to an exterior region thereof. A male half of a fluid transfer coupling is rotatably supported in an opening in an end of the connector and is equipped with an outwardly extending forward portion. The forward portion <b>locks</b> into an <b>engagement</b> and <b>locking</b> region of a female half of the fluid transfer coupling, with female half being rotatably supported in a receptacle. The receptacle has an opening aligned with locking region, with this opening having a pair of concentric, annularly disposed ramps extending around an interior portion of opening. These ramps are inclined toward the interior of the receptacle and are provided with slots through which rollers of the connector pass. After the connector is inserted into the receptacle (engaging forward portion into engagement region), relative rotation between the connector and receptacle causes the rollers to traverse ramps until the rollers abut and are gripped by retainers. This axially forces the forward portion into <b>locked,</b> sealed <b>engagement</b> with the engagement region...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir <b>locking</b> valve. Rotational <b>engagement</b> with an electric locking clutch. After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the cylindrical cam mechanism and reliability of the torque overload clutch must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|R
