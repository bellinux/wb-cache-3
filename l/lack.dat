The results indicate that, the closer <b>lacking</b> pick position to the seam exposed surface, the smaller drum load fluctuation is when existing one <b>lacking</b> pick on helical vane; the load fluctuation and position angle of two <b>lacking</b> picks on the drum inversely proportional when existing two <b>lacking</b> picks on helical vane, which is roughly {{in accord with the}} actual situation...|$|R

30|$|In {{the first}} map of group A, {{the total number}} of <b>lacking</b> links is 45 links as shown on the {{right-hand}} side of Fig.  7, which is equal to 29.61 percentages of all possible <b>lacking</b> links (152 links from 4 links of each 38 learner maps). Moreover, the diagnosis results suggest an important link that is the most number of <b>lacking</b> link. So, the “pass through” link causes the most misunderstanding among learners (15 learners from 38 learners of the class), and the instructor took the link as the main content of feedback {{in the form of the}} supplementary lecture. Subsequently, the instructor gave the feedback that emphasized on the “pass through” link especially more than the other <b>lacking</b> links. A line graph on the left-hand side of Fig.  8 represents the effectiveness of the feedback. The line graph of group A shows the decreasing of <b>lacking</b> links of all three maps. In this context, the number of <b>lacking</b> links at the “second map” was decreased when compared with the <b>lacking</b> links of the “first map” that means the learner’s understanding was increased after the instructor gave the feedback to learners. The total number of <b>lacking</b> links at the second map of group A remained 25 links that were decreased 55.56 percentages from the first map, and the <b>lacking</b> links of this second map are equal to 16.45 percentages of all possible <b>lacking</b> links. Also, the diagnosis results of the second checkpoint of group A suggest that the “pass through” link still the most number of <b>lacking</b> links, although the “pass through” link is the most decreased link among the <b>lacking</b> links from the first map. Another candidate link is the “does not pass through” link (7 tagged number), which the number of the link is not too much different from the “pass through” link (8 tagged number). So, the instructor designed the second feedback of group A based on these <b>lacking</b> links. Finally, the <b>lacking</b> links of the third map are presented in the line graph on the left-hand side of Fig.  8 as the “third map”. The total number of the <b>lacking</b> links is 16 links that means in the third map remained only 10.53 percentages of all possible <b>lacking</b> links.|$|R

40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} and other neurotrophins signal to neurons through the Trk family of {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases. TrkB is relatively promiscuous in vitro, {{acting as a}} receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin- 4 (NT 4) and, to a lesser extent, NT 3. Mice <b>lacking</b> TrkB show a more severe phenotype than mice <b>lacking</b> BDNF, suggesting that TrkB may act as a receptor for additional ligands in vivo. To explore this possibility, we generated mice <b>lacking</b> NT 4 or BDNF as well as mice <b>lacking</b> both neurotrophins. Unlike mice <b>lacking</b> other Trks or neurotrophins. NT 4 -deficient mice are long-lived and show no obvious neurological defects. Analysis of mutant phenotypes revealed distinct neuronal populations with different neurotrophin requirements. Thus vestibular and trigeminal sensory neurons require BDNF but not NT 4, whereas nodose-petrosal sensory neurons require both BDNF and NT 4. Motor neurons, whose numbers are drastically reduced in mice <b>lacking</b> TrkB, are not affected even in mice <b>lacking</b> both BDNF and NT 4. These results suggest that another ligand, perhaps NT 3, does indeed act on TrkB in vivo...|$|R
