5000|$|In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, {{in which}} the Kingdom of Prussia annexed Pomerelia, the town was {{incorporated}} into the Kingdom, and administered within the new province of West Prussia. Its name in German changed from Weyersfrey to <b>Neustadt</b> in Westpreußen, <b>a</b> name which was in use also before. The affix [...] "in West Prussia" [...] {{was added to the}} town's name in order to avoid confusion with a number of other towns carrying the same name. Decisive factors which boosted the development of the town in the 19th century were the 1818 establishment of <b>Landkreis</b> <b>Neustadt,</b> <b>an</b> administrative district, and the construction of the Danzig (Gdańsk) [...] - [...] Stettin (Szczecin) railway line, to which Neustadt was connected with a train station in 1870. Neustadt became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. During {{the second half of the}} 19th century, a significant number of Jewish families from the region began migrating to Syracuse, New York, including the renowned Shubert theatrical family. The Poles formed 59.3% of population in the district area of the city around this time. The city itself, however, was predominantly German with a Polish minority of 5 % in 1890.|$|R
