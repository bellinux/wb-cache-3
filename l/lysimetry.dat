This thesis {{presents the results of}} computer simulation and field testing of a promising new technique that allows water samples {{to be collected}} regardless of antecedent moisture content. Injection of a chemically neutral fluid will increase the moisture content of a relatively dry soil, allowing the collection of a sample that contains soil water diluted in the injection fluid. This can be analyzed to yield qualitative chemical data. Although injection was found to alter soil structure and soil-water chemistry in some instances, the technique can be used in existing lysimeters, without modification, to repeatedly obtain partially representative soil-water samples containing inorganic and organic compounds. Injection <b>lysimetry</b> is best suited to those applications, such as tracer tests and detection of containment leakage, where absolute chemical concentrations are not required...|$|E

This paper describes the building of a one-tree weighing lysimeter (3 × 3 m and 2. 15 m depth) located in an almond (Prunus dulcis cv. Guara) orchard, inside the experimental farm "Alameda del Obispo" in Córdoba, Spain, to measure orchard evapotranspiration (ET c). Following a review on <b>lysimetry,</b> the description of the construction of the weighing lysimeter is provided in detail, including considerations relative to system resolution and wind effects on the measurements. Finally, some preliminary results of the evaporation and transpiration of young almond trees are presented demonstrating that <b>lysimetry</b> in orchards provides accurate ET c values needed to determine irrigation water requirements.

The precision of percolation rates estimated using tracer methods depends on the tracer concentration, percolation rate, and the sensitivity of the chemical extraction and analysis methods. Percolation rates determined using the water balance method have a precision of approximately 100 mm/yr in humid climates and 50 mm/yr in semiarid and drier climates, which is too large to demonstrate that an AEFC is meeting typical equivalency criterion (30 mm/yr or less). In most cases, the precision will be much poorer.

The objective was to compare and evaluate chemical composition (in terms of NO 3 ' p, Cl) of soil water collected by the three most acceptable methods: i) ceramic suction cup sampling, ii) drainage <b>lysimetry</b> and iii) gravimetric soil sampling. The ceramic cups were installed either by surrounding the cup with silica flour slurry, or sand. The experiment was arranged as a nested factorial design where the three factors were: i) sampling method, ii) location, and iii) time of sampling. The study shows that the method of installation (use of silica slurry vs sand) of ceramic cups had a negligible effect on the mean values, {{but it appears that}} by using silica the uncertainty of the mean was reduced considerably.

Experimental evaluations of hillslope processes include a few that have investigated the influence of bedrock permeability on hydrologic response to climate (Hutchinson and Moore 2000; Tromp-van Meerveld et al. 2007), while a few others numerically modeled watersheds including bedrock properties (Flint and Flint 2006; Jones et al. 2008; Hopp and McDonnell 2009). Generally, these models are two- or three-dimensional, finite-element models that explicitly incorporate bedrock but are computationally intensive and cover small areas. Historically, recharge estimates have relied on monthly water balance models that incorporate simulations of evapotranspiration (Alley 1984), inverse modeling (Sanford et al. 2001), or <b>lysimetry</b> and tracer tests (Gee and Hillel 1988). Water-balance modeling to assess both recharge and runoff has been done at the site scale (Flint et al. 2002 a; Ragab 1996) and integrated with various measurements addressing different spatial scales (Flint et al. 2002 b).

40|$|Discrepancies {{can arise}} among surface flux {{measurements}} collected using disparate techniques due {{to differences in}} both the instrumentation and theoretical underpinnings of the different measurement methods. Using data collected primarily within a pair of irrigated cotton fields {{as a part of the}} 2008 Bushland Evapotranspiration and Remote Sensing Experiment (BEAREX 08), flux measurements collected with two commonly-used methods, eddy covariance (EC) and <b>lysimetry</b> (LY), were compared and substantial differences were found. Daytime mean differences in the flux measurements from the two techniques could be in excess of 200 Wm‒ 2 under strongly advective conditions. Three causes for this disparity were found: (i) the failure of the eddy covariance systems to fully balance the surface energy budget, (ii) flux divergence due to the local advection of warm, dry air over the irrigated cotton fields, and (iii) the failure of lysimeters to accurately represent the surface properties of the cotton fields as a whole. Regardless of the underlying cause, the discrepancy among the flux measurements underscores the difficulty in collecting these measurements under strongly advective conditions. It also raises awareness of the uncertainty associated with in situ micrometeorological measurements and the need for caution when using such data for model validation or as observational evidence to definitively support or refute scientific hypotheses...|$|E

Standard chemical analyses fail to distinguish between Spodosol-like soils in boreal forest and tundra. As an alternate method to assess present soil processes, tension lysimeters were placed under the horizons of Spodosol-like soils at three sites to collect in situ soil solution. Soil solu-tions obtained by irrigating the soil with deionized water were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, CaZ+, Mg 2 +, K+, iron, and total organiccarbon. Soils from the lysimeter sites were analyzed for pyro-phosphate and dithionite extractable Fe and Al. In the boreal forest, solid phase and soil solution analyses indicate that the process of podzolization has occurred and is currently occurring. In the boreal forest and tundra transition site, analyses show that podzolization occurs sporadically in wet years. In the tundra, conventional analyses indicate that podzolization has occurred; soil solution indi-cates a weak expression of this process.

Quality of the measured data {{is a critical}} value determining the quality of results and derived conclusions. The knowledge and practical experience of the technician performing the measurements is presenting the "human factor", which affects the quality of measured data most. The Multimedial Study Guide of Field Hydropedological Measurements (further referred to as “the Guide”) was created to present and explain selected field measurements determining soil physical and hydro-physical properties in a comprehensive, didactical and user-friendly way. The following topics are introduced: i) Soil sampling (disturbed and undisturbed soil samples), ii) Soil moisture content measurement using indirect non-destructive methods, iii) Determination of tensiometric soil water potential, iv) Measurement of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity in-situ with available groundwater level in measured layer and without available groundwater level in measured layer, v) Measurement of unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity, and vi) Basic presentation of <b>lysimetry.</b> The Guide was for students, and also for academic workers and other interested members of the public.

The Recharge Task was established {{to address the issue of}} ground water recharge in and around the LLW facility and throughout the Hanford Site as it affects the unconfined aquifer under the facility. The objectives of this report are to summarize the current knowledge of natural ground water recharge at the Hanford Site and to outline the work that must be completed in order to provide defensible estimates of recharge for use in the performance assessment of this LLW disposal facility. Recharge studies at the Hanford Site indicate that recharge rates are highly variable, ranging from nearly zero to greater than 100 mm/yr depending on precipitation, vegetative cover, and soil types. Coarse-textured soils without plants yielded the greatest recharge. Finer-textured soils, with or without plants, yielded the least. Lysimeters provided accurate, short-term measurements of recharge as well as water-balance data for the soil-atmosphere interface and root zone. Tracers provided estimates of longer-term average recharge rates in undisturbed settings. Numerical models demonstrated the sensitivity of recharge rates to different processes and forecast recharge rates for different conditions.

The measurements are necessary to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of ET and to refine the modeling tools. Besides the basic concepts, examples of applications of the different measuring techniques at leaf level (porometry), at plant-level (sap-flow, <b>lysimetry)</b> and agro-ecosystem level (Surface Renewal, Eddy Covariance, Multi layer BREB) are illustrated in detail. The agricultural practice requires a careful management of water resources, especially in the areas where water is naturally scarce. The detailed knowledge of the transpiration demands of crops and different cultivars, as well as the testing of new irrigation techniques and schemes, allows the optimization of the water consumptions. Besides some basic concepts, the results of different experimental irrigation techniques in semi-arid areas (e. g. subsurface drip) and optimization of irrigation schemes for different crops in open-field, greenhouse and potted grown plants are presented.

This study was conducted through scaling down the amount of soil data from a saline irrigation water experiment to see if one can still capture the essential soil salinity depth trends within the data, to a level that can enhance the ability of remote methods. A saline irrigation experiment with 6 water qualities was conducted for 8 years on 1. 2  ha of vineyard land near Robertson in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Soil water was sampled at regular intervals at 5 depths between 0. 15 and 1. 2  m with suction cup lysimeters at a fixed time following each irrigation. Electrical conductivity of the soil water (ECsw) was determined after sampling. Data collected over the full 8 -year period were investigated for depth trends in ECsw, seeking trend lines with lowest polynomial order that were still significantly predict the salinity profile. At all treatment levels a first order polynomial equation, fitted to the salinity profiles, significantly predicted the salinity trends. The ECsw value at only two depths could therefore be used to calculate total salt accumulation and soil water quality below the root zone.

40|$|Conference paper {{presented}} at the MODSIM 01, International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, held December 2001, The Australian National University, Canberra. Some land uses, such as land treatment of wastewater, could be operated for protection of the underlying groundwater if appropriate monitoring information were available. It is suggested that leachate quality in the vadose zone be monitored for operational management, by means of <b>lysimetry,</b> in preference to observations of groundwater quality with transport lag of months or years. Leachate data comprise values of solute concentration and associated increments of soil drainage flux, often collected at irregular time intervals, which are highly variable in space and time. These characteristics pose a data processing problem for operational management analogous to the requirement for the techniques of statistical process control in the manufacturing industries. For credible management of potential environmental effects, it is desirable that the quality assurance technique is based on concepts of physical processes which can be openly debated in terms of assumptions and model parameter values. This paper describes a data processing method based on one-dimensional solute transport through the vadose zone to the groundwater surface and subsequently by streamtubes in the groundwater to the designated target region. Smoothing of the leachate data. for real-time comparison wilh maximum allowable values, is governed only by longitudinal dispersion within the vadose zone and streamtubes, The concept of stream tubes without transverse dispersion addresses issues of equitable use of allowable aquifer contamination by land use managers. The computational algorithm for continual updating of management information is derived from the mixing cell concept for simulating dispersion. A demonstration example is presented using data on nitrate-N concentration and drainage flux of leachate from land treatment of meat processing wastewater, for feasible values of dispersivity in the vadose zone, and underlying aquifer...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} part of a {{comprehensive}} approach currently developed in Brazil to study biogeochemical cycles at the ecosystem level in Eucalyptus grandis plantations. It aims at assessing changes occurring in water chemical composition throughout their transfer in the soil, during the first year after planting. A <b>lysimetry</b> was installed in a 5 -year-old E. saligna stand. Lysimeters were strategically positioned within a compartment of E. saligna prior to the clear felling of the stand that would allow the assessment of a fertilization experiment planned on the same site for the next rotation. About 180 zero-tension lysimeters were installed in the upper soil layers and 136 ceramic cups were setup horizontally down to a 3 m depth and connected to an automatic vacuum pump. After the harvest of the E. saligna stand, a fertilization experiment of E. grandis improved seedlings was initiated using a complete randomized block design, with 6 blocks and 5 treatments. The objective was to compare the influence of different amounts of ammonium sulphate and sewage sludge fertilizations on biogeochemical cycling. At the end of the rotation, nutrient concentrations in soil solutions were low whatever the depth and the lysimeter type. After clear felling, soil solution ionic balances were dominated by NO 3 - and Al 3 +, whose concentrations increased substantially. No obvious change in concentrations was observed for all other elements. A proton unbalance, resulting from the interruption of NO 3 - uptake by plants after harvesting, might be responsible for the aluminium accumulation in soil solutions. After planting, fertilizer inputs were responsible for increasing concentrations of all elements applied until 1 m deep. Twelve months after planting E. grandis, the chemistry of soil solutions at 3 m deep had not developed.

40|$|Less than 0. 5 % native {{vegetation}} cover {{remains in the}} productive Canterbury Plains region of New Zealand. Incorporating native plants into agricultural landscapes could provide numerous benefits including shelter, supplementary stock fodder, production of essential oils or honey, wildlife-corridors, and protection of waterways. New Zealand’s native species are adapted to environments where nitrogen (N) occurs at low concentrations. Such environments are {{in stark contrast to}} New Zealand’s agricultural landscapes, where high inputs of fertilisers and animal effluents have elevated soil N. There is a lack of knowledge on how native species will interact with N in agricultural environments. Potentially, native species may alter nitrate leaching to receiving waters and emissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a potent greenhouse gas. This research aims to investigate the interaction with soil N of selected native species and their rhizospheres to gain an understanding of species-specific differences and potential effects on N fluxes. The native species investigated were typical of those used in restoration projects. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an introduced species that dominates New Zealand pasturelands, was used as a control. I studied rhizosphere soil and foliar N status at two planted restoration sites. Plant growth and uptake in response to agriculturally elevated N levels were investigated in greenhouse pot trials. A field experiment explored the effect of Kunzea robusta (kānuka) on N₂O fluxes from soil. Finally, farm-scale N uptake and reduction in N losses were modelled for various native planting scenarios. At the restoration sites New Zealand native species Austroderia richardii (toetoe), Phormium tenax (flax), Cordyline australis (cabbage tree), Coprosma robusta (karamu), K. robusta, Olearia paniculata (akeake) and Pittosporum tenuifolium (black matipo) had similar foliar N concentrations to L. perenne. While native species with winter leaf loss, Plagianthus regius (ribbonwood) and Sophora microphylla (kōwhai), had higher foliar N than these other species. There was significant inter species variation in rhizosphere soil mineral N concentrations among native species, with A. richardii and P. regius having higher nitrate status than L. perenne. Pot trials revealed that while native species tolerate high N loading (up to 1600 kg ha⁻¹), there was negligible growth response. Increased soil N concentrations resulted in increased foliar N in native plants, of which the high-biomass-producing monocotyledons assimilated the most. Nevertheless, foliar N concentrations were higher for L. perenne receiving N and farm-scale calculations showed L. perenne to extract more soil N than the native species. K. robusta reduced N₂O emissions following effluent application by 80 % relative to control soil, which emitted significant amounts. Modelling revealed that incorporating native species into agricultural landscapes reduced the N loading per hectare due to the reduced area of fertilised and grazed soil. The native monocotyledons, in particular P. tenax and Carex virgata (pukio), have greater potential to reduce nitrate leaching than the woody species and are the most suitable for receiving effluent, whereas K. robusta in farm paddocks may mitigate N₂O emissions following urine deposition by sheltering stock. Further work could involve <b>lysimetry</b> to quantify simultaneously the effects of native species on nitrate leaching and N₂O emissions. These findings provide a first step towards targeted native planting strategies in sustainable agricultural management...|$|E
40|$|Final {{covers for}} {{landfill}} have consisted of engineered barriers to prevent {{contact with the}} underlying waste, limit the generation of leachate and emission of landfill gas. The theory for cover design has predominantly relied on attempting to prevent moisture from draining into the waste by placing an impermeable or low conductivity barrier, often as compacted clay or more recently as geotextile or geocomposite layers (GCL). However, studies overseas over the last 10 – 15 years have shown that these barrier layers, particularly compacted clay barriers, may not perform as expected. Increasingly, interest has been focussed on designing covers that maximise evapotranspiration as this release to the atmosphere does not have other detrimental implications. In 2006, the Waste Management Association of Australia and the Australian Research Council co-funded collaborative research between 5 Australian Universities to research the performance of compacted clay barriers and the emerging technology of phytocaps (also known as ET (evapotranspiration), alternate or store-and-release covers). This PhD {{is part of this}} collaborative research and aimed to: quantify drainage from phytocaps and conventional caps; compare water balance performance of conventional caps, including a compacted clay barrier, and phytocaps under a range of climatic, soil and vegetation conditions; and assess the temporal changes in the covers. The trial methodology was based on field-scale <b>lysimetry</b> with phytocaps trialled in 5 Australian States. All test sections were constructed on previously landfilled cells and included a 10 m x 20 m lysimeter instrumented to measure weather, runoff, lateral flow (compacted clay sections only), drainage and soil moisture content. An adjacent control section without a liner to bound the area was also instrumented to provide an assessment {{of the impact of the}} lysimeter liner on the water balance. At 3 trial sites, the research included side-by-side comparison of a conventional compacted clay barrier cap and a phytocap. Data collection at the sites has been undertaken for 3 – 4 years. The climate at the trial sites varies from summer-dominant rainfall in a tropical climate to sub-tropical and temperate climates with all-year rainfall and to temperate climates with hot, dry summers. The soil varied from alluvial loam and basaltic-derived clayey loam to coarse loamy sand. At one site, municipal waste compost was added to the available sandy loam. The vegetation has also varied between the sites from dominantly tree-based vegetation to only native grasses. The research has found that phytocaps have the potential to reduce drainage to the same extent as conventional caps. Also, the short term data collected indicate that phytocaps are likely to be more sustainable in the longer term as the changes in the soil moisture content range over the trial timeframe tended to be beneficial in the phytocap, with increased soil storage as the plant roots developed, and detrimental in the conventional cap, with cracking and preferential flow paths developed in the compacted clay barrier. The phytocap also has greater potential for its performance to be easily improved (e. g. increasing plant density, changing plant species, adding soil ameliorants) when compared with compacted clay barriers. The drainage measured in both the phytocap and conventional caps was strongly influenced by the seasonal precipitation and the seasonality of precipitation. Long-term research is needed to confirm the findings herein and provide a better understanding of the impact of structural changes in the phytocap and improve the prediction of phytocaps in a wider range of Australian climates.

40|$|Current {{irrigation}} scheduling {{technologies are}} limited to refilling the root zone based on measured or predicted amount of water stored within the root zone. This needs measurement of soil-water status and specifying soil field capacity that make this approach expensive and challenging. The FullStopTM wetting front detector (FS) was specifically developed to be a simple and affordable technology to help farmers manage water, nutrients and salts in the root zone. This device responds to a strong wetting front, but research has shown it is less sensitive to weak redistributing wetting fronts, and this may compromise its efficacy in certain situations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to recommend {{a modified version of the}} FS that responds to weak redistributing wetting fronts and to develop guidelines for the deployment of these detectors to schedule irrigation. The research described herein comprises of two phases: the first phase focused on literature review, field evaluation of wetting front detector of varying sensitivities (WFD) and laboratory measurements of hydraulic properties of soil and wick materials. The second phase validates the HYDRUS- 2 D/ 3 D for the development of guidelines on how to use WFD to schedule irrigation. The first phase includes: i) a literature review on passive <b>lysimetry</b> that relates design features to the sensitivity of WFD and how prototypes of WFD operate; ii) hydraulic characterization of soil and wick materials to describe the functioning of the different WFD designs; iii) an empirical investigation to determine whether the wick characteristics limits the attainment of equilibrium between the opening of the outer tube and the water table in the inner tube; iv) field evaluations of five types of WFD under sprinkler and natural rainfall to examine the accuracy and sensitivity of the different WFD designs; and v) analysis of the equilibrium between the WFD and the surrounding soil, and recommendations for the best design options based on the sensitivity requirement for different situations. The second phase of the study used observed data sets to validate the Hydrus- 2 D/ 3 D model. After validation, the model was used to simulate different irrigation scenarios to develop guidelines for the deployment of WFD to schedule irrigation. Field evaluations of various WFD designs showed that length has significant effect on the sensitivity of WFD (P ≤ 0. 05). The 90 -cm-long Tube wetting front detector (90 TD) was significantly more sensitive than the original FS design. The hydraulic conductivity function of two wick materials (Diatomaceous Earth and Fine sand) were not limiting for the attainment of the equilibrium between the Tube Detector and the surrounding soil, and the opening of the Tube Detector and the water level in the inner tube. The Hydrus- 2 D/ 3 D model performed well in simulating the measured responses of FS or 90 TD and the experimental sensitivity thresholds of these detectors. This model was deployed to link WFD responses to different simulated irrigation scenarios to generate monitoring protocol such as detector placement depth, irrigation amount or interval. The model simulations showed that FS can be used to schedule irrigation objectively for sprinkler or drip irrigations, i. e. adjusting irrigation amount or interval based on the response of a detector. Though further study is warranted, model simulation has indicated that 90 TD can be used to improving furrow irrigation management. It is envisaged that WFD technology can guide farmers to make informed irrigation decisions and alerting farmers to percolation losses below the root zone.

To examine the influence of method and time of extraction on the composition and concentration of DOM, soil solution was collected from a raised peat bog in Central Scotland using water extraction, field suction <b>lysimetry,</b> and centrifugation techniques on a bimonthly basis over the period of a year (Aug 2003 – Jun 2004). Samples were analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), protein, carbohydrate and amino acid content. For all of the sampled months except June the biochemical composition of DOC varied with extraction method, suggesting the biological, chemical and/or physical influences on DOC production and loss are different within the differently sized soil pores. Water-extractable DOC generally contained the greatest proportion of carbohydrate, protein and/or amino acid of the three extraction methods. Time of extraction had a significant effect on the composition of water- and suction-extracted DOC: the total % carbohydrate + protein + amino acid C was significantly higher in Oct than Dec, Feb and Jun for water-extracted DOC and significantly greater in Dec than Aug, Apr and Jun for suction-extracted DOC. There was no significant change in the total % carbohydrate + protein + amino acid C of centrifuge-extracted DOC during the sampled year. Time of extraction also had a significant effect on the % protein + amino acid N in water- and centrifuge-extracted DON: Oct levels were significantly higher than Feb for water-extracted DON and significantly higher in Aug and Apr for centrifuge-extracted DON. Concentrations of total DOC and total DON were also found to be dependent on time of extraction. DOC concentrations showed a similar pattern of variation over the year for all methods of extraction, with concentrations relatively constant for most of the year, rising in April to reach a peak in Jun. DON concentrations in water- and centrifuge-extracted DON peaked later, in Aug. There were no significant seasonal changes in the concentration of suction-extracted DON. A lack of correlation between DOC and DON concentrations suggested that DOC and DON production and/or loss are under different controls. Laboratory-based incubation experiments were carried out to examine the dynamics of DOC biodegradation. Over a 70 day incubation period at 20 oC, the DOM from two types of peat (raised and blanket) and four samples of a mineral soil (calcaric gleysol), each previously exposed to a different management strategy, were found to be comprised of a rapidly degradable pools (half-life: 3 – 8 days) and a more stable pool (half-life: 0. 4 to 6 years). For all soil types/treatments, excepting raised peat, the total net loss of DOC from the culture medium was greater than could be accounted for by the process of mineralization alone. A comparison between net loss of DOC and loss of DOC to CO 2 and microbial biomass determined by direct microscopy suggested {{that at least some of}} the differences between DOC mineralised and net DOC loss were due to microbial assimilation and release. Changes in the microbial biomass during the decomposition process showed proliferation followed by decline over 15 days. The protein and carbohydrate fractions showed a complex pattern of both degradation and production throughout the incubation. The effects of repeated applications of trace amounts of litter-derived DOC on the rate of carbon mineralization over a 35 day period were investigated in a laboratory based incubation experiment. The addition of trace amounts of litter-derived DOC every 7 and 10. 5 days appeared to ‘trigger’ microbial activity causing an increase in CO 2 mineralisation such that extra C mineralised exceeded DOC additions by more than 2 fold. Acceleration in the rate of extra C mineralised 7 days after the second addition suggested that either the microbial production of enzymes responsible for biodegradation and/or an increase in microbial biomass, are only initiated once a critical concentration of a specific substrate or substrates has been achieved. The addition of ‘DOC + nutrients’ every 3. 5 days had no effect on the total rate of mineralization. To date DOC has tended to be operationally defined according to its chemical and physical properties. An understanding of the composition, production and loss of DOC from a biological perspective is essential if we are to be able to predict the effects of environmental change on the rate of mineralization of soil organic matter. This research has shown that the pools of DOC extracted, using three different methods commonly used in current research, are biochemically distinct and respond differently to the seasons. This suggests some degree of compartmentalisation of biological processes within the soil matrix. The observed similarities between the characteristics of the decomposition dynamics of both peatland and agricultural DOC suggests that either there is little difference in substrate quality between the two systems or that the microbial community have adapted in each case to maximise their utilisation of the available substrate. The dependency of the concentration and biochemical composition of DOC on the seasons requires further work to ascertain which biotic and/or abiotic factors are exerting control. Published research has focussed on factors such as temperature, wet/dry cycles, and freeze/thawing. The effect of the frequency of doses of trace amounts of DOC on increasing the rate of soil organic C mineralization, evident from this research, suggests that the interval between periods of rainfall may be relevant. It also emphasises how it can be useful to use knowledge of a biological process as the starting point in determining which factors may be exerting control on DOC production and loss.
