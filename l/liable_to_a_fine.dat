25|$|The fourth {{statute of}} the Compromise of 1850, enacted September 18, 1850, is informally {{known as the}} Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act.

500|$|A {{group of}} seven amateur scuba divers solved the mystery in November 2006, when they found a small {{submarine}} sitting upright on the seabed, [...] below sea level and approximately [...] from Bungan Head, off Sydney's Northern Beaches.
