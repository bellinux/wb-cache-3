40|$|Abstract — Vector Lyapunov {{theory has}} been {{developed}} to weaken the hypothesis of standard Lyapunov theory in order to enlarge the class of <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> {{that can be used}} for analyzing system stability. In this paper, we provide generalizations to the recent extensions of vector Lyapunov theory for continuous-time systems to address stability and control design of impulsive dynamical systems via vector <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions.</b> Specifically, we provide a generalized comparison principle involving hybrid comparison dynamics that are dependent on comparison system states as well as the nonlinear impulsive dynamical system states. Furthermore, we develop stability results for impulsive dynamical systems that involve vector <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> and hybrid comparison inequalities. Based on these results, we show that partial stability for state-dependent impulsive dynamical systems can be addressed via vector <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, we extend the novel notion of control vector <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> to impulsive dynamical systems. Using control vector <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions,</b> we present a universal decentralized feedback stabilizer for a decentralized affine in the control nonlinear impulsive dynamical system.

40|$|Summary. The {{method of}} <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> plays {{a central role}} in the study of the {{controllability}} and stabilizability of control systems. For nonlinear systems, it turns out to be essential to consider nonsmooth <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions,</b> even if the underlying control dynamics are themselves smooth. We synthesize in this article a number of recent developments bearing upon the regularity properties of <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions.</b> A novel feature of our approach is that the guidability and stability is-sues are decoupled. For each of these issues, we identify various regularity classes of <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> and the system properties to which they correspond. We show how such regularity properties are relevant to the construction of stabilizing feed-backs. Such feedbacks, which must be discontinuous in general, are implemented in the sample-and-hold sense. We discuss the equivalence between open-loop con-trollability, feedback stabilizability, and the existence of <b>Lyapunov</b> <b>functions</b> with appropriate regularity properties. The extent of the equivalence confirms the cogency of the new approach summarized here. ...|$|R
