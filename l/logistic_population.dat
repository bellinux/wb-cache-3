50|$|Population {{modeling}} {{became of}} particular interest to biologists in the 20th century as pressure on limited means of sustenance due to increasing human populations in parts of Europe were noticed by biologist like Raymond Pearl. In 1921 Pearl invited physicist Alfred J. Lotka to assist him in his lab. Lotka developed paired differential equations that showed the effect of a parasite on its prey. Mathematician Vito Volterra equated the relationship between two species independent from Lotka. Together, Lotka and Volterra formed the Lotka-Volterra model for competition that applies the logistic equation to two species illustrating competition, predation, and parasitism interactions between species. In 1939 contributions to population modeling were given by Patrick Leslie as he began work in biomathematics. Leslie emphasized the importance of constructing a life table {{in order to understand the}} effect that key life history strategies played in the dynamics of whole populations. Matrix algebra was used by Leslie in conjunction with life tables to extend the work of Lotka. Matrix models of populations calculate the growth of a population with life history variables. Later, Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson characterized island biogeography. The equilibrium model of island biogeography describes the number of species on an island as an equilibrium of immigration and extinction. The <b>logistic</b> <b>population</b> model, the Lotka-Volterra model of community ecology, life table matrix modeling, the equilibrium model of island biogeography and variations thereof are the basis for ecological population modeling today.|$|E

40|$|We give an {{introduction}} to the logistic and generalized logistic distributions. These generalized logistic distributions Type-I, Type-II and Type-III are indexed by a real valued parameter. They have been derived as mixtures with the standard logistic distribution and for discrete values of the parameter they describe the distribution of the minimum, maximum, and median, respectively, of a i. i. d. sample from a logistic distribution. We obtain exact results for the probability of correct subset selection from Type-I, Type-II and Type-III generalized <b>logistic</b> <b>populations</b> which only differ in their location parameter. In the course of establishing these exact results, we derive an explicit expression for the cdf of the median based on a sample from the logistic distribution of size 2 b - 1; it is a sum of b terms involving binomial coefficients. By the CLT we can use this explicit cdf to approximate the unknown cdf of the normal distribution. We show some numerical results which show that for b = 5 the approximation error is of the order 0. 001 in the middle and 0. 0001 in the tails. This implies that for practical purposes the Type-III family with b = 5 is indistinguishable from the normal family...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to present several new {{statistical}} tests of neutrality of mutations against a class of alternative models, under which DNA polymorphisms tend to exhibit excesses of rare alleles or young mutations.

It is found that the polymorphic patterns in a DNA sample under <b>logistic</b> <b>population</b> growth and genetic hitchhiking are very similar and that one of the newly developed tests, F(s), is considerably more powerful than existing tests for rejecting the hypothesis of neutrality of mutations. Background selection gives rise to quite different polymorphic patterns than does <b>logistic</b> <b>population</b> growth or genetic hitchhiking, although all of them show excesses of rare alleles or young mutations.

The modeling approach shows that a dispersal mechanism based on local information about the environment and population density can approximate the ideal free distribution. The analysis suggests that such a dispersal mechanism may sometimes be advantageous because it allows populations to approximately track resource availability.

The optimum harvesting rate is a close rate to 1/2 K where population will grow the fastest. Above K, the population growth rate is negative. The logistic models also show density dependence, meaning the per capita population growth rates decline as the population density increases.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we extend the study done by Ferrara and Guerrini [12], where two {{different}} research lines within the Ramsey model were joined together: the one studying {{the role of}} a <b>logistic</b> <b>population</b> growth rate (Accinelli and Brida [2]), and the one analyzing the effects of a Benthamite formulation for the utility function. The results obtained in [12] for the special case of a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution (CIES) utility function and a Cobb-Douglas production function are provided to be still true for a general utility function and a neoclassical production function. We have that the model is described by a three dimensional dynamical system, whose unique non-trivial steady state equilibrium is a saddle point with a two dimensional stable manifold. Con-sequently, the speed of convergence is determined by two stable roots, rather than only one as in the basic Ramsey model. In addition, in the special case of a CIES utility function and a Cobb-Douglas technology, an explicit solu-tion for the model can be derived, when capital’s share is equal to the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
