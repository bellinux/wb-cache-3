Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes she’d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made right then and there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she {{had to go through}} some personal things to come to the point where she'd <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> write for her in the manner that we did. It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is so personal. That was a big thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Mappa Producer Masao Maruyama Said in an interview: [...] "For 4~5 years, I kept {{searching for}} a {{suitable}} director to complete Kon's work. Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon's work, {{it would still be}} clear that it's only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine would still be a good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's. Dreaming Machine should be Kon's movie, him and only him, not someone else's. That means we cannot and should not [...] "compromise" [...] only to finish it. I spent years to finally reach this hard conclusion. Instead, we should take only Kon's [...] "original concept", and <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person's work, and I'm OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{discussion}} of substantive issues, the campaign's seriousness continued to come under attack. [...] Ed Koch elevated his criticisms of the campaign, calling it [...] "fraudulent" [...] and arguing that Trump is the [...] "greatest con artist in the world {{when it comes to}} trumpeting his own name [...] [...] [...] [...] y gut tells me that he knows nothing [...]" [...] Former White House adviser Dick Morris said [...] "I think he's mainly selling books." [...] Republican strategist Ed Rollins questioned whether Trump could [...] "say the right things" [...] or [...] "be willing to <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> put an organization together." [...] A New York Daily News/WNBC-TV poll showed that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being used only for Trump [...] "to promote himself." [...] Roger Stone commented that the perception problem would [...] "solve itself" [...] once the campaign would reveal the number of petition signatures it collected. [...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E

500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the lead part. He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Cowboys were jubilant {{about making}} their third Super Bowl {{appearance}} {{in the last four}} seasons. [...] "We're going home", Irvin said after the game.

5000|$|The {{show was}} universally panned by critics. It was criticised {{for being too}} similar to Harry Hill's TV Burp. Nick Norton of [...] "Off the Box" [...] also said [...] "The premise of Paddy's TV Guide, in which the host {{presents}} a series of lamentable clips from wretched television shows, all on a set theme each episode, is of little consequence. What is remarkable is {{the line in the}} credits that tells us it was [...] "Adapted from an original TV format by Paddy McGuiness and ITV". Which means that either ITV thought the show was too substandard even for the dreck it fills ITV2's schedule with, or Channel 4 actually paid good money to take it off its hands. Either way, shame on Channel 4. As Stewart Lee himself might say, to watch it really is the equivalent of <b>letting</b> <b>somebody</b> straddle your face and defecate directly onto your eyeballs." ...|$|R
2500|$|Weldon {{founded the}} Congressional Fire Services Caucus in 1987 and has {{consistently}} fought for increased funding for firefighters. He {{was the author}} of a bill that implemented a federal grant program for local fire departments that evolved into the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. He has fought for mandatory safety sprinklers in college dormitories and training of fire departments to deal with terrorism incidents involving chemical and biological weapons. At times, his alleged pork barrel spending was challenged by fiscal conservatives such as Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake; Weldon once told Flake, [...] "Doggone it, I’m not gonna <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> stand up here in total and complete ignorance and spout off a bunch of gobbledygook. Don’t stand up on the floor and make stupid allegations because you want a headline about cutting waste. This is not waste." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway." [...] However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. [...] "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do", says Blackman. [...] "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following a 1996 San Jose Mercury News article alleging the {{complicity}} of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Los Angeles crack {{epidemic of}} the 1980s, Waters {{called for an}} investigation. Waters questioned whether [...] "U.S.-government paid or organized operatives smuggled, transported and sold it to American citizens." [...] The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had failed to find any {{evidence to support the}} original story. [...] The Los Angeles Times also concluded after its own extensive investigation that the allegations were not supported by evidence. [...] The author of the original story, Gary Webb, was eventually transferred to a different beat and removed from investigative reporting, before his death in 2004. Webb was found in his apartment with two bullet holes in his head. His death was declared a suicide. Following these post-publication investigations, Waters read into the Congressional Record a memorandum of understanding in which former President Ronald Reagan's CIA director rejected any duty by the CIA to report illegal narcotics trafficking to the Department of Justice. Undeterred, Waters told the Los Angeles Times in 1997: [...] "It doesn't matter whether the CIA delivered the kilo of cocaine themselves or turned their back on it to <b>let</b> <b>somebody</b> else do it. They're guilty just the same." ...|$|E
