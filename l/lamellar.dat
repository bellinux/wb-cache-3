5|$|Scales also {{cover the}} head, {{parts of the}} thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia. The {{morphology}} of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975) and scales have been classified into three groups, namely hair-like, or piliform, blade-like, or <b>lamellar</b> and other variable forms.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted <b>lamellar</b> type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (<b>lamellar)</b> scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in <b>lamellar</b> phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, {{it is more difficult}} to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is <b>lamellar</b> with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a <b>lamellar</b> phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and <b>lamellar</b> phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E
5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously. Their horses were covered in <b>lamellar</b> armor {{to protect them from}} enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} white spore print. Both the spores and the basidia are dimorphic. The larger spores (macrospores) are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure 11–17.5 by 7–10µm. They are hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The macrobasidia are club shaped, measuring 38–57 by 8–14µm, {{and can be}} one- two-, three- or four-spored. The ratio of macrobasidia length to macrospore length is usually less than five to one. Clamp connections are present on the hyphae of several tissues of the mushroom. The hyphae of the gills (the <b>lamellar</b> trama) are arranged in a parallel fashion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, <b>lamellar</b> tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|One {{or more of}} the {{abdominal}} segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the telson (terminal section) to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (<b>lamellar</b> structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for gas exchange. In some terrestrial isopods, these resemble lungs.|$|E
5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or <b>lamellar</b> plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} Roman Empire, the {{principal}} military developments were attempts {{to create an}} effective cavalry force {{as well as the}} continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because {{it was not possible to}} put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and <b>lamellar</b> armour.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid <b>lamellar</b> liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light <b>lamellar</b> and scale armor was also used.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered <b>lamellar</b> bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} terms used to {{describe}} lipid phases: <b>lamellar</b> and non-lamellar phases. Lipids can undergo polymorphic or mesomorphic changes leading {{to the formation of}} <b>lamellar</b> or non-lamellar phases.|$|E
25|$|The dermal {{skeleton}} {{is organized}} in three layers: a superficial <b>lamellar</b> layer, a cancellous spongiosa, and a compact basal <b>lamellar</b> layer. Even in early ontogeny, these layers are apparent in specimen of Bothriolepis canadensis. The compact layers develop first. The superficial layer is speculated to have denticles {{that may have}} been made of cellular bone.|$|E
25|$|A late Roman ridge helmet of the Berkasovo-Type {{was found}} with a Hun burial at Concesti. A Hunnic helmet of the Segmentehelm type was found at Chudjasky, and another of the Bandhelm type at Turaevo. Fragments of <b>lamellar</b> helmets dating to the Hunnic period and within the Hunnic sphere have been found at Iatrus, Illichevka, and Kalkhni. Hun <b>lamellar</b> armour has not been found in Europe, {{although}} two fragments of likely Hun origin have been found on the Upper Ob and in West Kazakhstan dating to the 3rd–4th centuries. An unpublished find at a military warehouse near Toprachioi, Romania is known but it is uncertain {{if it can be}} attributed to Hun origin. It is known that the Eurasian Avars introduced <b>Lamellar</b> armor to the Roman Army and Migration Era Germanics in the Middle 6th Century, but this later type does not appear before then.|$|E
25|$|Corneal {{transplant}} surgery {{may be difficult}} due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts. Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for patients that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: wedge resection, <b>lamellar</b> crescentic resection, penetrating keratoplasty, <b>lamellar</b> keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating keratoplasty) may be performed if there is enough normal tissue present. However, {{if there is not}} enough normal tissue present, then attaching the graft is difficult.|$|E
25|$|An {{immature}} cataract {{has some}} transparent protein, {{but with a}} mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes <b>lamellar,</b> polar, and sutural cataracts.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols {{protected}} {{their horses}} {{in the same way}} as did they themselves, covering them with <b>lamellar</b> armor. Horse armor was divided into five parts and designed to protect every part of the horse, including the forehead, which had a specially crafted plate, which was tied on each side of the neck.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{somewhat}} {{effective for}} hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe acne rosacea. It {{can also be}} used to help treat harlequin ichthyosis, <b>lamellar</b> ichthyosis and is used in xeroderma pigmentosum cases to relieve keratoses. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for treatment of neuroblastoma, a form of nerve cancer.|$|E
25|$|A garment often shown {{worn with}} the klivanion was the kremasmata. This was a skirt, perhaps quilted or of pleated fabric, usually {{reinforced}} with metal splints {{similar to those}} found in the arm defences. Although the splinted construction is that most often shown in pictorial sources, there are indications that the kremasmata could also be constructed of mail, scale or inverted <b>lamellar</b> over a textile base. This garment protected the hips and thighs of the wearer.|$|E
25|$|The naked carp, {{a closely}} related species native to the high-altitude Lake Qinghai, is also able to remodel their gills in {{response}} to hypoxic conditions. In response to oxygen levels 95% lower than normoxic conditions, apoptosis of ILCM increases <b>lamellar</b> surface area by up to 60% after just 24 hours. However, this comes at a significant osmoregulatory cost, reducing sodium and chloride levels in the cytoplasm by over 10%. The morphological response to hypoxia by scaleless carp is the fastest respiratory surface remodelling reported in vertebrates thus far.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin, {{also known}} as 13-cis-retinoic acid (and colloquially {{referred}} to by its former brand name Accutane), is a medication primarily used to treat severe acne. Rarely, it {{is also used to}} prevent certain skin cancers (squamous-cell carcinoma), and in the treatment of other cancers. It is used to treat harlequin-type ichthyosis, a usually lethal skin disease, and <b>lamellar</b> ichthyosis. It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its isomer, tretinoin, is also an acne drug.|$|E
25|$|However, Orch-OR made {{numerous}} false biological predictions, {{and is not}} {{an accepted}} model of brain physiology. In other words, there is a missing link between physics and neuroscience, for instance, the proposed predominance of 'A' lattice microtubules, more suitable for information processing, was falsified by Kikkawa et al., who showed all in vivo microtubules have a 'B' lattice and a seam. The proposed existence of gap junctions between neurons and glial cells was also falsified. Orch-OR predicted that microtubule coherence reaches the synapses via dendritic <b>lamellar</b> bodies (DLBs), however De Zeeuw et al. proved this impossible, by showing that DLBs are located micrometers away from gap junctions.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{scattering}} {{techniques are}} some of the most useful techniques for determining the structural identification and shape of lipids. An X-ray beam of light is applied to the lipid in which a distinct X-ray pattern is revealed. This lattice pattern is based on the electron density and localization of electrons dispersed throughout the lipid in order to determine atomic positions. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult to determine patterns in lipids that are not well oriented such as non-lamellar phases. Although this can be a limitation in producing electron density reconstructions in lipids, X-ray diffraction is still a reliable method for obtaining structural information and distinguishing between <b>lamellar</b> and non-lamellar phases.|$|E
25|$|In the helical {{thylakoid}} model, grana {{consist of}} a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or <b>lamellar</b> thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While {{different parts of the}} thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior <b>lamellar</b> keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
25|$|Measuring {{crocodile}} age is unreliable, {{although several}} techniques {{are used to}} derive a reasonable guess. The most common method is to measure <b>lamellar</b> growth rings in bones and teeth—each ring corresponds {{to a change in}} growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet seasons. Bearing these inaccuracies in mind, it can be safely said that all crocodile species have an average lifespan of at least 30–40 years, {{and in the case of}} larger species an average of 60–70 years. The oldest crocodiles appear to be the largest species. C. porosus is estimated to live around 70 years on average, with limited evidence of some individuals exceeding 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp of the infraorder Caridea {{are more}} closely related to {{lobsters}} and crabs than they are {{to the members of the}} sub-order Dendrobranchiata (prawns). Biologists distinguish these two groups based on differences in their gill structures. The gill structure is <b>lamellar</b> in carideans but branching in dendrobranchiates. The easiest practical way to separate true shrimp from dendrobranchiates is to examine the second abdominal segment. The second segment of a carideans overlaps both the first and the third segment, while the second segment of a dendrobranchiate overlaps only the third segment. They also differ in that carideans typically have two pairs of chelae (claws), while dendrobranchiates have three. A third group, the Stenopodidea, contains around 70 species and differs from the other groups in that the third pairs of legs is greatly enlarged.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (2HNMR) is a technique that uses an external magnetic field and deuterium to replace the ordinary form of hydrogen. The ordinary form of hydrogen refers to the elemental form of hydrogen with a molecular weight of approximately 1 g/mol. It contains only one proton and has no neutrons. Deuterium is the isotope form of hydrogen which has a heavier mass compared to ordinary hydrogen. It contains one proton and neutron and has a molecular weight of approximately 2 g/mol. This technique {{can be used to}} investigate motions of acyl chains in lipids. It measures carbon and deuterium interactions and the mobility of these interactions within various regions of the lipid and also determines order parameters. The process involves using quadrupole signaling properties for examining <b>lamellar</b> versus non–lamellar phases as well. An external magnetic field monitors the alignment of paramagnetic compounds and uses changes in the positive or negative magnetic spin values to detect these changes.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis is a genus placed {{within the}} placoderm order Antiarchi. The {{earliest}} antiarch placoderms {{first appeared in}} the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era and could be found distributed on every paleocontinent by the Devonian period. The earliest members of Bothriolepis appear by the Middle Devonian. Antiarchs, as well as other placoderms, are morphologically diverse and are characterized by bony plates that cover their head and the anterior part of the trunk. Early ontogenetic stages of placoderms had thinner bony plates within both the head and trunk-shield, which allowed for easy distinction between early placoderm ontogenetic stages within the fossil record and taxa that possessed fully developed bony plates but were small by characterization. Placoderm bony plates were generally made up of three layers, including a compact basal <b>lamellar</b> bony layer, a middle spongy bony layer and a superficial layer; Bothriolepis can be classified as a placoderm since it possesses these layers. Placoderms were extinct {{by the end of the}} Devonian. Placodermi is a paraphyletic group of the clade Gnathostomata, which includes all jawed vertebrates. It is unclear exactly when gnathostomes emerged, but the scant early fossil record indicates that it was sometime in the Early Palaeozoic era. The last species of Bothriolepis died out, together with the rest of Placodermi, at the end of the Devonian period.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. It is ironic that the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with <b>lamellar</b> armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E
25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the <b>lamellar</b> capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E
