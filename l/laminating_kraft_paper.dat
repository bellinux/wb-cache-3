40|$|The lapped {{dielectric}} {{which has}} superior electrical, mechanical and chemical properties {{has been used}} for HVDC cable insulation for many years. Space charge dynamics in such insulation have been studied in this paper. Three kinds of laboratory made samples with polypropylene and <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> <b>laminated</b> have been investigated by the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique under 5 kV/mm up to 50 kV/mm at room temperature. No charge injection was observed in polypropylene sample when stressed from 5 kV/mm to 10 kV/mm. The results of polypropylene lapped <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> (PPLP) sample show that charge peaks at the two electrodes drop very quickly after applying voltage. At the same time, a large amount of charges accumulate at the interface area with the same polarity as the closed electrode. The other lapped sample with <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> between two polypropylene layers was also studied at 5 kV/mm. The opposite charge polarity peaks were found from the interfaces, suggesting that the ionization in <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> may have a major influence on the electrical performance of the lapped dielectri...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of natural}} {{polymers}} is an alternative to polymers derived from petroleum that may reduce industrial waste {{and contribute to the}} environmental protection. Following the same reasoning, the biodegradability of paper packaging is already known for it being a product originated from cellulosic materials (cellulosic fibers). The aim of this work was to assess the process of degradation from the junction of two different materials; biopolymer and sheets of paper. This paper proposes the study of the biodegradability of chitosan film-coated <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> sheets and emulsified chitosan film-coated <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> sheets added with palmitic acid, both in comparison with uncoated <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> sheets. The biodegradability study was conducted based on analyses of biofilm formation by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), soil respiration, Gravimetry, Microbial Biomass Carbon and enzymatic soil activity and evaluation. 201...|$|R

40|$|Moisture {{in power}} {{transformers}} are undesirable but yet unavoidable; hence necessitating its continuous study. The <b>kraft</b> <b>paper</b> {{of the oil}} filled transformer absorbs much of its moisture from the insulation oil {{in which it is}} immersed. The dielectric properties of the paper can be determined {{as a function of the}} wetting, penetration and saturation of the paper by the aqueous liquid in the oil. This paper compares the absorption characteristics of aqueous substances into <b>kraft</b> <b>paper</b> in two commercial insulation oils; palm based Palm Fatty Acid Ester (PFAE) biodegradable oil and petroleum based Hyrax Hypertrans mineral oil. <b>Kraft</b> <b>paper</b> thicknesses used in this study were varies from 0. 2 mm to 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm. Test oil samples are taken directly from drum given by the suppliers. The study result shows that substances absorbed by <b>kraft</b> <b>paper</b> immersed in both insulation oils is dependent on paper thickness and chemical composition of the oils. The result shows that 0. 2 mm thick paper absorbs the same aqueous percentage from both insulation oils irrespective of their constituent moisture content while the substance absorbed in both the 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm thick papers immersed in PFAE is higher that immersed in Hyrax Hypertrans by about 1 %. It also shows that the rate of absorption reduces as the paper thickness increases. This concludes that irrespective of the high initial moisture content of PFAE being higher than that of Hyrax Hypertans, same aqueous substance is diffused into <b>kraft</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|R
