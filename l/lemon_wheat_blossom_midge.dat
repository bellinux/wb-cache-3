In Abhängigkeit vom Befallsstadium der Weizenähre und der Biologie der Erreger sind folgende Schadsymptome bekannt: Verminderung der Kornzahl pro Ähre (C. tritici) bzw. geschrumpfte oder missgebildete Körner (S. mosellana) (Mölck, 2006). Der Saatgutwert wird beeinträchtigt und die Backqualität beeinflusst (Miller & Halton, 1961). Hinsichtlich Prognose und Überwachung des Auftretens von Weizengallmücken gab es bisher keine praxistauglichen methodischen Ansätze im Bundesland Sachsen-Anhalt. Hinzu kommt, dass der derzeit verstärkt praktizierte pfluglose Anbau von Weizen nach Weizen ein höheres Befallsrisiko erwarten lässt. Mit der Identifikation von Sexualpheromonen, die als hoch attraktiv für Männchen von S. mosellana gelten (Gries & al., 2000), eröffnen sich nun neue Prognosemöglichkeiten. Die effektive Nutzung von Pheromonfallen zum Monitoring von Gallmücken könnte somit ein erster Baustein zur Erarbeitung praxistauglicher Richtwerte darstellen. In einer zweijährigen Testphase wurde in Zusammenarbeit mit der Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau geprüft, ob die Pheromonfallen eine Gradationswahrscheinlichkeit der Problemschädlinge, insbesondere in Risikofruchtfolgen signalisieren können. Die Ergebnisse sowie Daten zu weiteren Überwachungsansätzen werden präsentiert. <b>Lemon</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midges</b> (Contarinia tritici) and Orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midges</b> (Sitodiplosis mosellana) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) {{belong to}} the most {{prominent}} insect pests in winter wheat (Holland & al., 1996). However, no practical method exists to predict or monitor {{the impact of these}} insect pests. There is also a lack of recent research on the issue particulary for Central Germany (older studies include: Lübke & Wetzel, 1984, Volkmar & 1989). Consequently, this study attempts to provide new data on the occurrence, monitoring and crop damage of <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midges.</b> It also focuses on the impact of changing agricultural conditions such as wheat-to-wheat crop rotation, reduced soil tillage or different crop variants. A systematic survey of midge occurrence and crop damage in a wheat-to-wheat crop rotation was carried out at a research field (variants: Elvis, Altos in 2005) and conventional winter wheat fields in 2006 (variant Tommi). S. mosellana were monitored by means of pheromone traps. In 2006, white traps were tested as an alternative method to collect data on S. mosellana and C. tritici. Flight activity of adult midges was monitored on 13 different dates (Tab. 1). Crop damage was evaluated on 8 dates (Tab. 2). A total of 50 spikes per variant and date were randomly selected for microscopical examination. The analysis included parameters such as number of larvae per infested seed, number of corn thrips (larvae and adults) per spike or number of infested seeds per spike. In 2005, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in the phenological growth stage of full flowering (BBCH 65 - 69). The activity density was higher in the Elvis variant with 260 midges per trap (monitoring until mid-flowering) as compared to the Altos variant with 89 midges per trap (monitoring until the end of flowering period). In 2006, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in BBCH 51 (beginning of heading) with 246 midges per trap (Tommi variant). In 2005 the highest abundance of larvae per ear was established for BBCH 75 with an average of 2. 1 (Altos) and 1. 6 (Elvis). In 2006 these numbers were significantly higher. In the Tommi variant, an average of 14. 3 larvae per ear was reached during BBCH 70 - 73. The ratio of midge-damaged kernels was evaluated in 2005 on BBCH 80 - 85 with 6. 3 % (Altos) and 4. 4 % (Elvis), while in 2006 a ratio of 23. 5 % was reached in the Tommi variant. The results suggest that the intensity of crop damage depends on the correlation of two factors. The closer the activity peak of midges correlate with the sensitive wheat growth stage of heading (BBCH 50 - 59), the higher the crop damage. This is highlighted by the results of 2006 in the Tommi variant. In other cases, S. mosellana reached its activity peak much later (in 2005 during BBCH 65 - 69, resp. in 2006 on BBCH 73 - 75) and the ensuing crop damage was significantly smaller. In conclusion, the results of this survey in Central Germany stress the influence of changing agricultural conditions and regional cultivation concepts. They also recommend further studies that cover several years in open habitats...|$|R
40|$|Agronomists often {{underestimate}} the damage inflicted by the orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge,</b> Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin), a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) pest. The main risk arises when {{the emergence of}} the adult midges coincides with wheat ear emergence. The emergence of adult midges was monitored in Belgium over four years and analysed against climate data, establishing the significance of specific rainfall events as triggers for the final phase of development prior to emergence. This discovery, combined with experience from previous models, was incorporated into a new forecasting model, described in this paper. The new model consists of three separate phases. The first phase comprised a temperature accumulation of 250 degree-days (DD) above 3 °C, starting from 1 January. Once this initial condition is satisfied, the second phase starts, and it lasts until the occurrence of a double signal consisting of a rise in the mean daily temperature up to 13 °C, followed by rainfall. This rainfall event triggers an accumulation phase of 160 DD above 7 °C. Once this last condition is met, the adults emerge. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This pest {{is known to}} be {{susceptible}} to many insecticides, but various field observations have suggested that some fungicides could also significantly affect S. mosellana. In order to confirm these field observations, the effect on adult midges of several fungicides commonly applied to wheat crops was investigated in the laboratory and in small plots in the field. In each experiment, the fungicides were compared with a positive (insecticide) and a negative control (water). Four fungicides were assessed in the laboratory, each with five doses based on basis of a tenfold dilution starting at the field-recommended dose. The mortality rate was evaluated after 24 hours and the lethal dose 50 % (LD 50) was determined for each product. In the field, six fungicides were tested at the recommended dose. The effect of each product was compared {{on the basis of the}} number of S. mosellana adults caught alive with an insect vacuum sampler (Vortis®) on the morning after the treatments.

40|$|The orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge,</b> Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin), can {{significantly}} reduce wheat yield. Growing resistant wheat cultivars {{is an effective}} way of managing this pest. The assessment of cultivar resistance in field trials is difficult because of unequal pressure of S. mosellana caused by differences in cultivar heading dates relative to the flight period of S. mosellana adult females and huge variations of egg laying conditions from 1 day to another. To overcome these hurdles and to expose all cultivars homogeneously to the pest, an assessment method of cultivar resistance was developed under semi-field conditions. In 2015, the resistance of 64 winter wheat cultivars to S. mosellana was assessed. Few or no larvae developed in the ears of resistant cultivars, but in susceptible cultivars, large numbers of larvae developed. Seventeen cultivars proved to be resistant, whereas 47 were susceptible. The identification of new resistant cultivars offers more opportunities to manage S. mosellana. The phenotyping method is easy, cheap, efficient and reliable. It {{can be used to}} guide the breeding of new resistant wheat cultivars. Using specific midge populations, this method could also be used in research on new resistance mechanisms in winter wheat or in other cereal species. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge</b> (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana G 9 hin) is an {{important}} insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many growing regions. Sm 1 is the only described OWBM resistance gene and {{is the foundation of}} managing OWBM through host genetics. Sm 1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2 BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM 1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm 1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm 1 region. The present study mapped Sm 1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM 1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm 1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm 1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage. Seven SNPs were tested on a collection of wheat lines known to carry Sm 1 and not to carry Sm 1. Sm 1 -flanking SNPs were identified that were useful for predicting {{the presence or absence of}} Sm 1 based upon haplotype.

Several hymenopterous parasitoids are known to attack S. mosellana. For the effective biological control of this pest by its parasitoids, the hostparasitoid synchrony is particularly important. The synchronization between the emergence of S. mosellana and its parasitoids was studied under controlled conditions with soils sampled from two locations. For both sites, three parasitoid species were identified: Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Euxestonotus error (Fitch) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) and Platygaster tuberosula (Kieffer) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). The hypothesis that parasitoid emergence is triggered by the same rainfall that induces host emergence was tested by simulating three rainfall events, a week apart. The parasitoid M. penetrans emerged later than S. mosellana {{with a mean of}} 57 ± 7 DD (degree-days above 7 °C) for insects collected from Juprelle and 68 ± 10 DD for those from Veurne (i. e., 4 - 5 days after its host). M. penetrans was therefore closely synchronized with its host through the same inductive rainfall, but {{this was not the case}} for E. error or P. tuberosula. Depending on when the rainfall that triggered the emergence of S. mosellana occurred, E. error and P. tuberosula emerged either before or after their host. M. penetrans is a more effective biocontrol agent of S. mosellana compared to P. tuberosula and E. error. Greater knowledge about parasitoid emergence could lead to the better positioning of insecticide treatments against wheat midge that protect and conserve the parasitoid populations.

Despite its agricultural importance, scarce knowledge exists about the molecular mechanism(s) that are involved in the Hessian fly/wheat interactions. Research presented in this thesis primarily focuses on identifying midgut-expressed genes in the insect during its interaction with wheat. The first part of the thesis concentrates on the aspect of digestion and includes data on two midgut-specific serine proteases and a putative peritrophin gene. Both serine proteases were cloned from the Hessian fly via homology-based cloning, while the peritrophin gene was recovered from an expressed sequence tag (EST) project. In the second part, genes constituting detoxification and antioxidant defense were studied to validate their importance in the biology of the insect and during interaction with its host. Part three focuses on immune response genes that display differential gene expression patterns in the insect and also seem to have a role in moderating the midgut micro-flora.

40|$|Abstract Background In most protein-coding genes, greater {{sequence}} {{variation is}} observed in noncoding regions (introns and untranslated regions) than in coding regions due to selective constraints. During characterization of genes and transcripts encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins (SSSGPs) from the Hessian fly, we found {{exactly the opposite}} pattern of conservation in several families of genes: the non-coding regions were highly conserved, but the coding regions were highly variable. Results Seven genes from the SSSGP- 1 family are clustered as one inverted and six tandem repeats within a 15 kb region of the genome. Except for SSSGP- 1 A 2, a gene that encodes a protein identical to that encoded by SSSGP- 1 A 1, the other six genes consist of a highly diversified, mature protein-coding region as well as highly conserved regions including the promoter, 5 '- and 3 '-UTRs, a signal peptide coding region, and an intron. This unusual pattern of highly diversified coding regions coupled with highly conserved regions {{in the rest of}} the gene was also observed in several other groups of SSSGP-encoding genes or cDNAs. The unusual conservation pattern was also found in some of the SSSGP cDNAs from the Asian rice gall midge, but not from the orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge.</b> Strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence conservation. Conclusion Rapid diversification in mature SSSGPs suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation. The conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood. This report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many insects enter a {{developmental}} arrest (diapause) {{that allows them}} to survive harsh seasonal conditions. Despite the well-established ecological significance of diapause, the molecular basis of this crucial adaptation remains largely unresolved. Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), the orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge</b> (OWBM), causes serious damage to wheat throughout the northern hemisphere, and sporadic outbreaks occur in the world. Traits related to diapause appear to be important factors contributing to their rapid spread and outbreak. To better understand the diapause mechanisms of OWBM, we sequenced the transcriptome and determined the gene expression profile of this species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome analysis using short-read sequencing technology (Illumina) and gene expression analysis with a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. The sequencing results generated 89, 117 contigs, and 45, 713 unigenes. These unigenes were annotated by Blastx alignment against the NCBI non-redundant (nr), Clusters of orthologous groups (COG), gene orthology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. 20, 802 unigenes (45. 5 % of the total) matched with protein in the NCBI nr database. Two digital gene expression (DGE) libraries were constructed to determine differences in gene expression profiles during diapause and non-diapause developmental stages. Genes related to diapause were analyzed in detail and in addition, nine diapause-related genes were analyzed by real time PCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The OWBM transcriptome greatly improves our genetic understanding and provides a platform for functional genomics research of this species. The DGE profiling data provides comprehensive information at the transcriptional level that facilitates our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of various physiological aspects including development and diapause stages in OWBM. From this study it is evident that various genes coding metabolic enzymes are crucial for diapause and metamorphosis...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{resistance}} to the orange <b>wheat</b> <b>blossom</b> <b>midge</b> (Sitodiplosis mosellana; OWBM) is an important breeding target to prevent yield and quality losses of durum wheat produced in western Canada. To date, only a single characterized midge resistance gene, Sm 1, has been identified. Sm 1 confers antibiosis {{resistance to}} the OWBM. It has been genetically localized to chromosome 2 BS of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Sm 1 has been introgressed into locally adapted germplasm. Currently, no Sm 1 carrying durum wheat lines are available for commercial production, and no studies have characterized the influence of Sm 1 on yield and end-use quality of durum wheat. The main objectives of this study were: 1) To {{determine the effect of}} Sm 1 on grain yield and end-use quality. 2) To genetically map the Sm 1 introgression. For this work, 122 F 5 : 9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the midge susceptible durum wheat cultivar CDC Verona (Sm 1 “-”) and resistant experimental line DT 780 (Sm 1 “+”). Agronomic and end-use quality traits of the mapping population were analyzed. The results from each environment were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis at Kernen (SK) in 2009 and 2010, and at Indian Head (SK) in 2009. On average, the presence of Sm 1 was associated with higher grain yield and yellow pigment content, but lower kernel weight, reduced grain protein content, and weaker gluten properties. However, it was possible to identify RIL lines carrying Sm 1 that expressed higher kernel weight, grain protein content, and stronger gluten. A genetic linkage map spanning 58 cM on chromosome 2 B near Sm 1 was constructed. QTL mapping suggested that the total length of the Sm 1 introgression into durum wheat was approximately 11 cM. Nearly all traits measured showed QTLs associated with Sm 1. For grain protein content, a QTL proximal to Sm 1 was identified, suggesting that Sm 1 per se may not be contributing to the reduced grain protein observed in the Sm 1 carriers of the RIL mapping population. The results presented here suggest that on average, Sm 1 is associated with higher grain yield and some reduced end-use quality factors, but that {{it may be possible to}} combine Sm 1 with high grain yield and end-use quality equivalent to current check cultivars...|$|R

In subtropical Reunion Island, populations of P. mangiferae are observed all-year round, but the pattern {{and the role of}} dormancy in their life cycle have never been documented. Weperformed field and laboratory experiments using more than 15, 000 larvae. We demonstrated that a larval diapause may affect a part of the midge population, regardless of the season. The total duration of the diapause varied from 6 weeks to more than 1 year. One year of field monitoring showed that the highest incidence of diapause was observed in larvae collected during the summer from mango leaves, where it affected approximately one-third of the individuals. This facultative diapause allows the permanent presence of P. mangiferae in the orchards. By recording diapause duration during 22 weeks under controlled conditions, we showed that high temperatures (26 °C) increased diapause duration and extended the range of the dates of diapause emergence, whereas cool temperatures (20 °C) shortened diapause duration and shortened the range of the dates of emergence from diapause. A temperature decrease from 26 to 20 °C triggered the emergence of diapausing individuals. These mechanisms ensure the synchronization of the emergence of diapausing individuals with the appearance of mango inflorescences, which is also induced by cool winter temperatures.

The objectives {{of our study}} were to highlight the genetic and ecological abilities of this monophagous gall midge to invade new habitats and to evaluate its genetic structure on an isolated island. This study, carried out in subtropical Reunion Island, is {{based on data from}} population dynamics surveys and from molecular analyses (mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites). Using 11 microsatellite loci and an extensive sampling of 27 populations at 17 sites, we tested the genetic differentiation between populations sampled on different mango organs and cultivars at different seasons and under different climatic and cultural environments. We checked for the existence of a seasonal bottleneck. Our results showed that a single species, P. mangiferae, was present all year round with no genetic bottleneck at any of the sites sampled, regardless of the climatic and cultural conditions, and that it fed on inflorescences and young leaves. These characteristics showed the ecological plasticity of P. mangiferae, despite its low genetic diversity and, consequently, the invasive potential of this species. Populations in Reunion Island are structured into two clusters in sympatry and present in different proportions at each site. One cluster was more frequently found in the cultivated mango area. This work provides insights into the relationships between gall midges and tree host plants in a subtropical agro-ecosystem, as well as into the role of the population genetic structure in the establishment process of a monophagous invasive cecid fly.

40|$|International audienceModelling is a {{powerful}} and convenient tool for synthesizing knowledge about a complex system, exploring system functioning or simulate its evolution under different weather or technical scenarios. However, such models are few on perennial fruit crops and concern mainly well-studied temperate species but not tropical species. Our aim {{is to develop a}} crop model for mango that synthesizes the knowledge acquired on the processes involved in fruit yield and quality development, and biotic and abiotic factors that affect them. The ongoing modelling approach, developed for the cultivar Cogshall in Réunion Island, is presented. The crop model combines complementary phenological, architectural and ecophysiological viewpoints and relies on two sub-models. A structural sub-model accounts for architectural development and phenology of the mango tree, based on endogenous factors and temperature-controlled laws. It predicts the 3 D vegetative and reproductive structure dynamics of the tree over successive growing cycles. The structural sub-model is described in Boudon et al. (presented in this symposium). A functional sub-model accounts for carbon- and water- related physiological processes occurring at the branch level and considers weather and source–sink factors, as affected by cultural practices. It predicts fruit growth and quality development. Currently, it is completed with fruit maturation processes and fruit sensitivity to fruit fly infestation; and the model extension at the tree scale is taken into consideration for C exchanges. Further challenging steps are: (i) to link the sub-models and validate the crop model; (ii) to further incorporate the effects of cultural practices (pruning, irrigation, and fruit thinning) on the temporal and quantitative components of tree development; and (iii) to link the crop model to pest models, particularly fruit fly and mango <b>blossom</b> gall <b>midge.</b> From an applied point of view, the global model will allow simulation-based design of management solutions for a sustainable mango production.

Nowadays advances are such that the consumer can {{have a variety of}} foods, with appealing sensory properties, a high nutritional value and contribute fully preserved to their health and well-being. The act of eating is no longer considered a mere caloric intake needed to maintain the metabolic activity of our body, therefore an alliance as arisen between the intake of nutrients of common foods and the functional foods that besides being healthy are also a source of pleasure. Given this growing health concern and the cult of functional food increasingly sought by consumers, the horticultural industry has suffered a major expansion over recent years. The consumption increase of fruit and vegetables is due, among other things, to the greater availability and better preparation of products in the market and also to the greater awareness by consumers of the important relationship between diet and health. The political and economic scenario that results of globalization makes the development of new products a key factor for business competitiveness by imposing a very fast market dynamic. The modern consumer demands innovative products, with convenience and adequate quality. The objective of this dissertation is to create a product that becomes an answer {{to the needs of the}} consumers and the food industry, a Fuji apple pulp stabilized by additives, which will provide a greater nutritional value to the product and a longer shelf life. This pulp will be enriched with antioxidants and dietary fiber and will undergo a study on the effects of de incorporation of additives on the bioactive compounds of the product. For this study the pulps will be under freezing conditions (- 18 ºC) during 36 days. The experiment was developed in several phases, the first one being the base formulation of the product, its constituents, and based on the results it was decided that the formulation would consist of: 5 % pineapple, 5 % lemon, 3 % blackberry and 2 % wheat bran. Two pulps were produced, one with apple, pineapple, blackberry and wheat bran; the other with apple, <b>lemon,</b> blackberry and <b>wheat</b> bran. The stabilization of the pulps was achieved through the use of two food additives: ascorbic acid and citric acid; and completed with a freezing process. This represented a second phase of the experiment, the formulation of the additives concentration. Physical, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out in order to achieve the characterization of the product and the acceptance levels of additives. The parameters evaluated during this phase were: CIE Lab colour, the measurements of dry matter, ash content, pH, total soluble solids, mineral content, water activity, fiber content, total phenols, acidity and ascorbic acid content. All the samples were submitted to sensory analyses. The results were statistically treated using RSM methodology through the statistical program Statistica 8. 0. The third phase consisted on the optimization of the pulps formulation. The products were submitted to the same kind of characterization plus the study of the role that the fiber incorporation had on the pulps. The final results showed that the addition of 0, 6 % ascorbic acid and 0, 4 % citric acid makes it possible to obtain a pulp with better sensory acceptance and also chemically stable. The phenolic and fiber component of the pulps is very high which indicates that this might be a product with functional properties beyond the nutritional value. The fiber incorporation study showed that it enhances the nutritional value of the pulp. The fourth and final phase was the study of the antioxidant capacity of the final product (pulp with Fuji apple, pineapple (5 %), blackberry (3 %), wheat bran (2 %), ascorbic acid (0, 6 %) and citric acid (0, 4 %)), which demonstrated the difference between the final pulp, with all its ingredients and a pulp with only one or two chosen ingredients. This allowed to perceive that this experiment culminated with the development of a product chemically safe, with good quality parameters, and functional properties, rich in fiber, mainly hemicelluloses, a component that promotes the regulation of gastrointestinal transit since they are not digestible by the human body. This product is also rich in minerals such as magnesium and potassium, and antioxidants...|$|R
