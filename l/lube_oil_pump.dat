50|$|On February 8, 1976, a Pacific American Airlines Douglas YC-112A (prototype of the DC-6 series), {{registration}} N901MA, {{experienced the}} separation of its no. 3 engine shortly after takeoff from Hollywood-Burbank Airport. The one of engine's propeller blades passed through the fuselage and severed pneumatic, hydraulic, and emergency airbrake lines {{as well as the}} electrical wiring for Curtiss electric propeller controls and some engine instruments. The blade continued out of the fuselage and struck the no. 2 engine, disabling its <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> scavenge <b>pump</b> and causing it to begin filling with oil. After an abortive attempt to land at Burbank, which became a touch-and-go when the crew discovered that hydraulic brakes, thrust reverse, and emergency air brakes were all inoperative, the captain elected to attempt an emergency landing on the longer, uphill Runway 34L at Van Nuys. Because of severe damage resulting in loss of power from the No. 2 engine, a bare firewall where the No. 3 engine had separated, and drag from the drooping landing gear and flaps, the airplane was unable {{to make it to the}} runway and attempted to land on a golf course in the final approach corridor. The nose of the aircraft struck a 24 inch cm concrete foundation of a partially constructed building, separating the nose gear main trunnion and jamming the gear assembly up into the cockpit. The three flight crew members aboard the aircraft perished, although the two stewardesses and a baggage handler in the cabin survived.|$|R

40|$|The fleet is {{plagued with}} leaking lube oil pumps due to {{mechanical}} shaft seal failures. Correction programs {{have resulted in}} improved shaft sealing techniques however, there {{continues to be a}} leakage problem on most classes of ships. The ultimate solution is to eliminate the mechanical shaft seal. This has been proven to be a very successful solution and has additional benefits of eliminating the motor to pump coupling, which further reduces maintenance. The newly developed Canned <b>Lube</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Pump</b> is the solution. It combines the proven screw pump design with the proven Oil-Through motor design. The resulting compact pumping unit is substantially smaller and lighter than the legacy unit. The motor is cooled by a portion of the oil, that is being pumped to the system. This eliminates the motor cooling fan and eliminates grease packed motor bearings, further reducing maintenance. A comprehensive factory and shipboard testing program has demonstrated that this new unit will eliminate oil leaking from lube oil pumps, thus will reduce shipboard maintenance substantially...|$|E

The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator functions to purify the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired. To prevent similar accident occurring again, some suggestions are presented.

40|$|LecturePg. 125 - 132. The {{reliability}} of a steam turboset is dependent, among other things, on correct functioning of its hydraulic lubrication and control system. An essential requirement is a reliable oil supply {{over the whole}} operating range. The main <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> carries {{to a large degree}} this responsibility. The design and operational aspects of it will be dealt with in this paper. Air dispersed in oil is known to endanger, in extreme cases, the safe and reliable operation of the turbogroup. Besides operating interferences of various system components an interruption of oil supply to the bearings may result in serious consequences. Without going into details of oil qualities, operational consequences as well as corrective measures, of air present in oil will be discussed. The increasing specific demands imposed upon steam turbines may bring about new oil system difficulties. The subject matter presented here treats extreme cases of thermal loading of the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> as in the case when coming into contact with hot turbine parts.

Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine exhaust sample. The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> was used as a test aerosol. Special <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. <b>Lube</b> <b>oil</b> doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption was predicted from known <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> ash concentrations and measured ash emissions. The non-doped fuel tests yielded lower than expected <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption estimates while the doped tests showed an ash recovery of 31 %. Transient ash measurements were demonstrated. Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations. Transient engine speed and loads were also measured by the HTOM. Ash diameter concentrations were measured in real-time showing definite spikes of ash emissions at transient load steps...|$|R
40|$|Nanomanufacturing {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} to create domestic jobs and facilitate economic growth. In response to this need, U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy issued a Research Call to develop nanomanufacturing capabilities at the National Laboratories. High performance catalysts represent {{a unique opportunity to}} deploy nanomanufacturing technologies. Re-refining of used <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> offers {{an opportunity to}} create manufacturing jobs and decrease dependence on imported petroleum. Improved catalysts are required to produce a better quality product, decrease environmental impact, extend catalyst life, and improve overall economics of <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> re-refining. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) in cooperation with Universal Lubricants, Inc. (ULI) and Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) have carried out a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to prepare nanostructured hydrotreating catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to exhibit superior performance for the re-refining of used <b>lube</b> <b>oil.</b> We investigated the upgrading of recycled <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> by hydrogenation using commercial, synthetically-modified commercial catalysts, and synthesized catalysts. A down-flow (trickle bed) catalytic unit was used for the hydrogenation experiments. In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1 } and C{sup 13 } NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging. An alternate approach was undertaken to deeply upgrade ULI product oils. Using a synthesized catalyst, much lower hydrogenation temperatures were required than commercial catalysts. Other performance improvements were also observed. The resulting <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> fractions were of high purity even at low reaction severity. The products recovered from both the ALD and other processes were water-white (even those from the low temperature, low residence time (high space velocity), low conversion runs). These results indicate that highly upgraded recycle <b>lube</b> <b>oils</b> can be produced using ALD-deposited active metal catalysts.
