Using gears results in measurable 'backlash' which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, <b>low</b> <b>torque</b> DC motors, which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the harmonic drive is often used.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The <b>low</b> <b>torque</b> coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E

2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively <b>low</b> <b>torque,</b> propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E

40|$|Most {{bacteria}} that swim are propelled by flagellar filaments, each driven {{at its base}} by a rotary motor embedded in the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane.

At high speeds and <b>low</b> <b>torques,</b> torque increases with temperature and is sensitive to hydrogen isotope. At room temperature, torque varies remarkably little with speed from about - 100 Hz (the present limit of measurement) to about 200 Hz, and then it declines rapidly reaching zero at about 300 Hz.

In addition, the lateral trapping is kept constant. Very <b>low</b> <b>torques</b> can be obtained such that rotational Brownian motion of birefringent particles can be observed.
