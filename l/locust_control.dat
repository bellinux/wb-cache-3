5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for <b>locust</b> <b>control.</b> The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts.

5000|$|Until recently, {{the only}} current of <b>controlling</b> <b>locust</b> bean moth was malathion dusting, {{three or four}} times per growing season. Because of the height of the palm trees (sometimes over 50 ft), {{commercial}} treatments were applied exclusively by powerful dusting equipment that delivers the insecticidal dust through a hand-directed tube. This produces a “fog” of insecticide during application that essentially blankets the ground with malathion, which is wasteful and creates unintended nontarget effects on other animal species, as well as [...] "environmental pollution". Furthermore, the accumulation of the malathion dust on the skin of dates creates problems with desiccation of the fruit, reducing the overall quality of the product. Encroachment of date gardens and urban areas has been forcing the California date producers to move away from malathion dusting, but until recently, no other alternatives for <b>locust</b> bean moth <b>control</b> were available.|$|R

25|$|Early {{warning and}} {{preventative}} control is the strategy adopted by locust-affected countries in Africa and Asia {{to try to}} stop locust plagues from developing and spreading. In the 1920s-1930s, <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> became a major field for international cooperation. The International Agricultural Institute developed several programmes aimed at exchanging data about the desert locust and international conferences were held in the 1930s: Rome in 1931, Paris in 1932, London in 1934, Cairo in 1936 and Brussels in 1938. Colonial empires were heavily involved in these attempts to control locust pests which affected heavily the Middle East and parts of Africa. The USSR also used <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> as a way to expand its influence in the Middle East and Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{the primary}} method of {{controlling}} desert locust infestations is with insecticides applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at ultra-low volume (ULV) rates of application. The insecticide is {{acquired by the}} insect directly or via secondary pickup (i.e. walking over or eating the residue on a plant). Control is undertaken by government agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized {{organizations such as the}} Desert <b>Locust</b> <b>Control</b> Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA).|$|E
40|$|Locusts {{are known}} for their ability to jump large {{distances}} to avoid predation. The jump also serves to launch the adult locust into the air in order to initiate flight. Various aspects of this important behavior have been studied extensively, from muscle physiology and biomechanics, to the energy storage systems involved in powering the jump, and more. Less well understood are the mechanisms participating in control of the jump trajectory. Here we utilise video monitoring and careful analysis of experimental directional jumps by adult desert locusts, together with dynamic computer simulation, in order to understand how the <b>locusts</b> <b>control</b> the direction and elevation of the jump, the residual angular velocities resulting from the jump and the timing of flapping-flight initiation. Our study confirms and expands early findings regarding the instrumental role of the initial body position and orientation. Both real-jump video analysis and simulations based on our expanded dynamical model demonstrate that the initial body coordinates of position (relative to the hind-legs ground-contact points) are dominant in predicting the jumps’ azimuth and elevation angles. We also report a strong linear correlation between the jumps’ pitch-angular-velocity and flight initiation timing, such that head downwards rotations lead to earlier wing opening. In addition to offering important insights into the bio-mechanical principles of locust jumping and flight initiation, the findings from this study will be used in designing future prototypes of a bio-inspired miniature jumping robot that will be employed in animal behaviour studies and environmental monitoring applications...|$|R

25|$|From October 2003 to May 2005, West Africa {{faced the}} largest desert locust {{outbreak}} in 15 years. The upsurge started as small independent outbreaks that developed in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Sudan {{in the autumn}} of 2003. Two days of unusually heavy rains that stretched from Dakar, Senegal to Morocco in October allowed breeding conditions to remain favourable {{for the next six months}} and the desert locusts rapidly increased. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of northwest Africa in early 2005 slowed the development of the locusts and allowed the <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> agencies to stop the cycle. During the upsurge, nearly 130,000km² were treated by ground and aerial operations in more than 20 countries. The costs of fighting this upsurge have been estimated by the FAO to have exceeded US$400 million, and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion, which had disastrous effects on the food security situation in West Africa.|$|E
500|$|In {{years when}} <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> is needed, the hoppers are {{targeted}} in spring by applying water-based, contact pesticides using tractor-based sprayers.

The use of ultralow-volume spraying of contact pesticides from aircraft in overlapping swathes is effective against nomadic bands {{and can be used}} to treat large areas of land swiftly.

2500|$|The {{change from}} an {{innocuous}} solitary insect to a voracious gregarious one normally follows {{a period of}} drought, when rain falls and vegetation flushes occur in major desert locust breeding locations. The population builds up rapidly and the competition for food increases. As hoppers get more crowded, the close physical contact causes the insects' hind legs to bump against one another. This stimulus triggers a cascade of metabolic and behavioral changes that cause the insects to transform from the solitary to the gregarious phase. When the hoppers become gregarious, their colouration changes from largely green to yellow and black, and the adults change from brown to pink (immature) or yellow (mature). Their bodies become shorter, and they give off a pheromone that causes them to be attracted to each other, enhancing hopper band and subsequently swarm formation. Interestingly, the nymphal pheromone {{is different from the}} adult one. When exposed to the adult pheromone, hoppers become confused and disoriented, because they can apparently no longer [...] "smell" [...] each other, though the visual and tactile stimuli remain. After a few days, the hopper bands disintegrate and those that escape predation become solitary again. It is possible that this effect could aid <b>locust</b> <b>control</b> in the future.|$|E

At different distances and time,the heads of - instar nymphs and - instar nymphs were irradiated, and the death rate was observed two hours, two days and three days after treatment;the leaves and stems of host plants were irradiated,and the growth state was observed. The results indicated that the locusts were killed when power density nears the tissue’s thermal damage threshold. Besides, the death rate was higher along with longer irradiation time, greater power density (nearer irradiation distance) and younger instar nymphs. At distance 3 cm and time 2 s,the death rate of - instar nymphs was 80 % 3 days after irradiation, and the gross growth state of host plants kept well. So, locusts especially before instar nymphs can be killed easily and host plants are not influenced if only suitable laser energy and wavelength are chosen. In this work, the results proved it’s feasible to <b>control</b> <b>locusts</b> by laser. Index Terms—laser irradiation; locust plague control; locusts; host plants I...|$|R
