500|$|On the church's northeastern {{elevation}} {{there are}} three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation [...] high, due to its location on sloping ground. At {{the center of this}} elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|E
500|$|The church {{interior}} has an {{open floor}} plan, with a sanctuary measuring [...] wide and [...] long. The floor plan {{is an open}} nave, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors, which access an unadorned narthex. Two tapered-square pilasters support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade, accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} output hoppers, or stackers, {{located in the}} photo on the left lower side. One could program to select the output hopper for each card read, so it was {{possible}} to read cards and separate them into two groups. Cards were placed in the top hopper ("face down, nine-edge leading") and a plate was added {{on the top of the}} cards. They were read thru and came out to one of the left <b>lower</b> <b>hoppers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw {{her on a}} March 1983 {{segment of}} 60 Minutes, he championed , a joint {{resolution}} originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. [...] Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (<b>lower</b> half) and <b>Hopper</b> {{became one of the}} Navy's few female admirals.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "grain auger" [...] {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to move grain from trucks, grain carts or grain trailers into grain storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A grain auger may be powered by an electric motor; a tractor, through the power take-off; or sometimes an internal combustion engine mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the <b>lower</b> end, a <b>hopper</b> receives grain from the truck or grain cart. A chute on the upper end guides the grain into the destination location.|$|R
50|$|The roof is clad in asphalt shingles. On {{the east}} side it is pierced by six segmental-arched dormer windows sided in copper. They are set with four-over-four double-hung sash with a <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> and four-light sides. Large scroll {{brackets}} {{mark the end of}} the north and south parapets.|$|E
50|$|At {{the corner}} the wing has a blind {{diagonal}} facet, with engaged brick piers dividing {{them from the}} side elevations. An entrance with metal double doors is located. In between the corners are four evenly spaced single and double windows on both stories, set with the <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> windows seen elsewhere on the building. The third story has another simulated oculus similar to the other ones.|$|E
50|$|All {{other windows}} are tall 12-over-8 with a <b>lower</b> <b>hopper.</b> Corners are quoined in cast stone. As with the east facade, stone beltcourses {{serve as the}} lintel line for the first story windows and the sill for those {{immediately}} above. The centers of both gables are set with oculi similar to those on the main section. The north pavilion is similar, but with a more modest central door meant primarily as an exit.|$|E
50|$|Both wings have {{a similar}} design. A cast stone water table at ground level is topped by 16-light windows with an eight-light <b>lower</b> <b>hopper,</b> with smaller {{versions}} at the corners. At the lintel level is a cast stone beltcourse, with a wider one above serving as the sill line for similar windows, also found above. Topping those windows is a cast stone frieze that ends below the applied metal at the roofline.|$|E
50|$|At {{the center}} of the second story is an {{aluminum}} double door, each with eight narrow lights, flanked by four more such lights on the side, topped by a rectangular 15-light transom. On each side are double-hung 12-over-6 sash with a <b>lower</b> <b>hopper,</b> flanked by fluted pilasters that rise to the next story. The two bays to their sides are set with nine-over-six double-hung lower-hopper sash in an arched surround with a keystone and five-light sidelights, on a brick face. Below each is a recessed panel. Around the corner, the bay is blind, recessed below another arch. The recessed bay is set with eight-over-eight double-hung lower-hopper arched sash in a decorative surround.|$|E
5000|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation 4 ft high, due to its location on sloping ground. At the center of this elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|E
50|$|The church {{interior}} has an {{open floor}} plan, with a sanctuary measuring 28 ft wide and 43 ft long. The floor plan {{is an open}} nave, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately 6 in, are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors, which access an unadorned narthex. Two tapered-square pilasters support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade, accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels.At the southeastern end of the sanctuary, the altar is atop a decagonal platform about 8 ft above the floor and accessible {{by a pair of}} four-step staircases. On the elevated platform is also a table holding a Bible. A recessed rectangular apse, flanked by a pair of fluted, engaged columns, is behind the altar. A painting of Jesus hangs {{in the center of the}} apse, with an American flag to its immediate north. An organ and a piano are north of the altar, with a baptismal font south of it. The altar platform and aisles are carpeted red. The sanctuary's northern and southern elevations exposed brick chimneys connected to gas heating units, which were installed around 1970. A brass chandelier with clear glass hurricane globes is suspended in the center of the sanctuary; on the northern and southern elevations, two brass electric lanterns are adjacent to the stained-glass windows.|$|E
40|$|A 10 m-high locally {{supported}} silo containing flour or {{sugar is}} analyzed. The horizontal cross-section of the 6. 2 m-high vertical walls is an irregular octagon with four sides of 1. 9 m {{and the remaining}} four of 0. 7 m. The walls and upper hopper (from the top section of the columns to the bottom boundary of the walls) are made of stainless steel of class AISI 430 and have a thickness of 1. 5 mm. The <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> (below the the top section of the columns) is made of stainless steel of class AISI 304 and has a thickness of 3 mm. The silo was installed into a site with PGA approximately equal to agS = 0. 3 g for TR = 475 years. Elasto-plastic analyses {{in the presence of}} geometric nonlinearities and initial imperfection were carried out. The L-shaped columns showed torsional buckling under serviceability conditions. Therefore, they were replaced with box section profiles. Moreover, the stiffening of the ring positioned at the transition between upper and lower parts of the hopper was proposed. The seismic response is ruled by the mass of the contained solid. Then, a pushover analysis with a mass-proportional lateral force profile was conducted. The capacity curve is almost linear up to failure of the rings in {{the upper part of the}} walls. At this load level, the shell elements in the hopper have largely exceeded the elastic range. However, due to the proposed retrofitting, the seismic resistance is adequate...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue of ship {{structural}} details is {{of major}} {{concern in the}} maritime industry as it can generate fracture issues that may compromise structural integrity. In the present study, a fatigue analysis of the <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> knuckle connection of a bulk carrier was conducted using the Finite Element Method by means of ABAQUS/CAE software. The fatigue life was calculated using Miner's Rule and the long-term distribution of stress range {{by the use of}} the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The cumulative damage ratio was estimated using the fatigue damage resulting from the stress range occurring at each load condition. For this purpose, a cargo hold model was first generated, which extends over the length of two holds (the mid-hold and half of each of the adjacent holds) and transversely over the full breadth of the hull girder. Following that, a submodel of the area of interest was extracted in order to calculate the hot spot stress of the connection and to estimate the fatigue life of the structural detail. Two hot spot locations were identified; one at the top layer of the inner bottom plate and one at the top layer of the hopper plate. The IACS Common Structural Rules (CSR) require that specific dynamic load cases for each loading condition are assessed. Following this, the dynamic load case that causes the highest stress range at each loading condition should be used in the fatigue analysis for the calculation of the cumulative fatigue damage ratio. Each load case has a different effect on ship hull response. Of main concern, when assessing the fatigue strength of the <b>lower</b> <b>hopper</b> knuckle connection, was the determination of the maximum, i. e. the critical value of the stress range, which acts in a direction normal to the weld toe line. This acts in the transverse direction, that is, perpendicularly to the ship's centerline axis. The load cases were explored both theoretically and numerically in order to establish the one that causes the highest damage to the location examined. The most severe one was identified to be the load case induced by beam sea condition where the encountered wave comes from the starboard. At the level of the cargo hold model, the model was assumed to be simply supported at its ends. A coarse mesh was generated in order to represent the overall stiffness of the structure. The elements employed were quadrilateral shell elements, each having four integration points. A linear elastic analysis was performed because linear elastic material behavior can be presumed, since only localized yielding is allowed by most design codes. At the submodel level, the displacements of the analysis of the cargo hold model to the outer region nodes of the submodel acted as boundary conditions and applied loading for the submodel. In order to calculate the hot spot stress at the hot spot locations, a very fine mesh zone was generated and used. The fatigue life of the detail was found to be 16. 4 years which is lower than the design fatigue life of the structure (25 years), making this location vulnerable to fatigue fracture issues. Moreover, the loading conditions that induce the most damage to the location were found to be the various ballasting conditions...|$|E
