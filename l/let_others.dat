They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of joints, immune senescence, accumulation of visceral fat and type 2 diabetes are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called apoptosis, to instruct cells to destroy themselves.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Walt Disney Studios {{released}} a full-length animated film {{based on the}} Andersen fairy tale. [...] Featuring an Academy Award-winning soundtrack with songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, [...] the film garnered glowing reviews, and was credited with revitalizing both the studio {{and the concept of}} animated feature films. [...] Notable changes to the plot of Andersen's story include the elimination of the grandmother character and the religious aspects of the fairy tale, including the mermaid's quest to obtain an immortal soul. [...] The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid's voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince's love. [...] However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed, and the sea-witch is vanquished. [...] The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying. [...] Among other things, the film was praised for portraying the mermaid as an independent and even rebellious young woman, rather than a passive actor content to <b>let</b> <b>others</b> determine her destiny.|$|E
