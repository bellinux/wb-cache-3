5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the {{characters}} in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E
5|$|The {{executives}} <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> idea, {{and while}} Silverman required a few drawings before committing, Weiss immediately put Bakshi {{to work on}} the series' development. Once Silverman saw the character designs, he confirmed that CBS would greenlight the show, on the condition that Bakshi serve as its creative director. It would appear as a segment of Mighty Mouse Playhouse on the network's 1966–67 Saturday morning schedule; the series was renamed Mighty Mouse and the Mighty Heroes in recognition of the new segment.|$|E
5|$|While {{negotiating}} the rights {{for his third}} independent film, Cagney starred in 20th Century Fox's 13 Rue Madeleine for $300,000 for two months of work. The wartime spy film was a success, and Cagney was keen to begin production of his new project, an adaptation of William Saroyan's Broadway play The Time of Your Life. Saroyan himself <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> film, {{but it was a}} commercial disaster, costing the company half a million dollars to make; audiences again struggled to accept Cagney in a nontough-guy role.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, VH1 {{broadcast}} a ten-part series entitled I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s. The series {{was adapted from}} a BBC series, first broadcast in 2000, in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s, coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from 2003's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s, to further variants like I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s Strikes Back, I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s, and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s: Part Deux. More recently, VH1 premiered I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s 3-D and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s: Volume 2. So eager was the network {{to capitalize on the}} trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, {{despite the fact that the}} decade had not yet ended (I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> New Millennium, broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000-2007). This was thought to be final installment of the series until 2014, when I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> 2000s continued the format.|$|R

5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After the first few weeks of distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
5|$|I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire {{in all of}} {{her many}} versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but Coyle was displeased when {{industry}} officials {{wanted him to}} change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque. Due to complications from the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Fargo, North Dakota, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and Duluth. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died {{a few weeks after}} the screening, <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5000|$|I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s is a BBC {{television}} mini-series {{that examines}} the pop {{culture of the}} 1980s.

5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E

5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> scenery.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E
5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
