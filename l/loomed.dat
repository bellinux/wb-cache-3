5|$|With the {{departure}} of Portuguese professionals and tradesmen, the new country had no senior workforce to maintain its infrastructure, and economic collapse <b>loomed.</b> Privileged commercial links were established with several communist countries by the FRELIMO regime {{at the expense of}} NATO, which rapidly lost influence in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Lancashire <b>Loom</b> was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} <b>loom.</b> Jacquard <b>looms</b> and Dobby <b>looms</b> are <b>looms</b> that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate <b>looms,</b> or mechanisms added to a plain <b>loom.</b> A Northrop <b>Loom</b> was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern <b>looms</b> run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet <b>looms,</b> water jet <b>looms</b> and rapier <b>looms.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{the end of}} war {{approached}} and hostilities with the Sioux Indians <b>loomed,</b> Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became {{more important to the}} army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. As a result, he returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat {{for the rest of his}} career. Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire <b>loomed,</b> Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co amid a series of board disagreements in 1934. He took control of The Churchill Machine Tool Co and, with Maginness as managing director, in December of that year embarked on a scheme to expand production and replace obsolete machinery, some of it over 20 years old, {{in an attempt to}} achieve an average output figure of £40,000 per month. However, there were difficulties in decision-making and wariness as the clouds of war <b>loomed,</b> most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had done much to assist it out of the depths of depression.|$|E

Modern <b>looms</b> include air-jet, rapier <b>loom</b> with electronic jacquard, projectile.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand <b>loom</b> to high speed air jet <b>loom.</b> This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand <b>looms,</b> dobby and jacquard shuttle <b>looms,</b> terry towel <b>looms,</b> rapier dobby and jacquard <b>looms,</b> air jet <b>loom,</b> sectional warping machine and sizing machine.|$|R
5000|$|An air-jet <b>loom</b> is a {{shuttleless}} <b>loom</b> {{that uses}} a jet of air to propel the weft yarn through the shed. It {{is one of two}} types of fluid-jet <b>looms,</b> the other being a water-jet <b>loom,</b> which was developed previously. [...] Fluid-jet <b>looms</b> can operate at a faster speed than predecessor <b>looms</b> such as rapier <b>looms,</b> but they are not as common.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tropical cyclone watches and warnings, several other actions were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600oil workers were moved inland, though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate a rig south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mayor of Port Arthur Malcolm Grant asked 800residents to evacuate Sabine Pass, due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in Port Arthur and Beaumont. In nearby Orange, crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana evacuated, with at least 67people taking shelter at a school in Lake Charles. An additional 2,500people fled Grand Isle, as {{the threat of the}} only road to the island flooding <b>loomed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke {{was laid}} down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 12 January 1912 and {{launched}} on 12 October of that year. After completing fitting-out work, she began sea trials on 25 November 1913. The ship {{was completed in}} March 1914, and she joined the Home Fleet after completing her trials. In the Home Fleet, she served as the flagship of Admiral Sir George Callaghan. On 29 July 1914, as war <b>loomed</b> on the Continent, Iron Duke {{and the rest of}} the Home Fleet was ordered to proceed to Scapa Flow from Portland to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect <b>loomed</b> of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
50|$|Several {{other types}} of hand <b>looms</b> exist, {{including}} the simple frame <b>loom,</b> pit <b>loom,</b> free-standing <b>loom,</b> and the pegged <b>loom.</b> Each of these can be constructed, and provide work and income in developing societies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} {{path of the}} <b>looms</b> {{is a key to}} study on the <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Based on the studies on historical materials and archeological findings of the <b>looms</b> in ancient China, we found that there were two paths in the development process of the <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Before the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), plain weave and figure-weave fabrics were produced on similar <b>looms.</b> But after the Han Dynasty, the two kinds of <b>looms</b> evolved into all kinds of the treadle <b>loom,</b> the multi-heald and multi-treadle <b>loom</b> and the draw <b>loom...</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial <b>looms</b> originally very closely mimicked handweaving <b>looms,</b> modern industrial <b>looms</b> are very different. A <b>loom</b> with a shuttle, such as most hand weaving <b>looms,</b> will produce a very different selvage from a <b>loom</b> without a shuttle, {{like some of the}} modern industrial <b>looms.</b> Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.|$|R
5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844. The faction in favor of giving church authority to a hierarchy of bishops called themselves the Methodist Episcopal Church and took an anti-slavery stance in the north. Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in the United States. As the impending Civil War <b>loomed</b> over {{the nation in the}} 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel.|$|E
5|$|The Pye strip {{was such}} an advance on the EMI unit that the EF50 became a key {{strategic}} component. As a German invasion of the west <b>loomed</b> in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which Mullard, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched {{to pick them up}} in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940. The Pye strip, and its 45MHz intermediate frequency, would be re-used in many other wartime radar systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate to turn over his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find. Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing {{to turn over the}} records. The Old Court continued to meet in a church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky <b>loomed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally, power <b>looms</b> used {{a shuttle}} {{to throw the}} weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more {{efficient}} shuttleless <b>loom</b> came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless <b>looms</b> in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner & Swasey. Draper licensed the slower rapier <b>loom.</b> Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of <b>looms</b> designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless weaving machines, rapier <b>looms,</b> air-jet <b>looms</b> and water-jet <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a weaving shed was to provide spaces for {{rows and rows of}} {{identical}} <b>looms.</b> A standard shed would house 1200 <b>looms,</b> and it was common to think in multiples of 400 <b>looms.</b> These <b>looms</b> would be tentered by weavers who worked from four to eight <b>looms</b> each and were paid on piece-rate. The <b>looms</b> would be maintained by a skilled tackler who would be on hand to gait the <b>looms</b> and effect instant repairs or adjustments. There would be four tacklers for 400 <b>looms.</b> The <b>looms</b> were powered by leather belts from overhead cross-shafts, on bevel gears from the line shaft that ran the length of the shed.|$|R
50|$|Shemma, shama, and kuta are all cotton-based cloths {{used for}} making Ethiopian clothing. Three types of <b>looms</b> {{are used in}} Africa: the double heddle <b>loom</b> for narrow strips of cloth, the single heddle <b>loom</b> for wider spans of cloth, and the ground or pit <b>loom.</b> The double heddle <b>loom</b> and single heddle <b>loom</b> might be of African origin. The ground or pit <b>loom</b> {{is used in the}} Horn of Africa, Madagascar, and North Africa and is of Middle Eastern origins.|$|R
5|$|The {{recession}} of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War <b>loomed.</b> The steel factories of Sheffield {{were set to}} work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, {{but it was the}} heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War <b>loomed,</b> the British Admiralty {{commissioned}} Lethbridge {{to undertake}} a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending {{much of the time}} visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, News from Tili. As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote <b>loomed</b> out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of harnesses was lifted while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of <b>loom</b> {{is known as a}} rising shed <b>loom,</b> and examples include the table <b>loom,</b> dobby <b>loom</b> or the Jack <b>loom.</b> The other method used in harness <b>looms</b> is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected harnesses because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed <b>loom.</b> Counterbalance and countermarch <b>looms</b> are of this second type.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of {{vertical}} <b>looms,</b> {{all of which}} can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village <b>loom,</b> the Tabriz or Bunyan <b>loom,</b> and the roller beam <b>loom.</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{emphasis}} placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940. Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as war with Japan <b>loomed</b> in 1941, but these proved inadequate. The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941, while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain {{in order to protect}} the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Royal Oak {{returned}} to the Home Fleet and was made flagship of the Second Battle Squadron based in Portsmouth. On 24 November 1938, she returned {{the body of the}} British-born Queen Maud of Norway, who had died in London, to a state funeral in Oslo, accompanied by her husband King Haakon VII. Paying off in December 1938, Royal Oak was recommissioned the following June, and in the late summer of 1939 embarked on a short training cruise in the English Channel in preparation for another 30-month tour of the Mediterranean, for which her crew were issued tropical uniforms. As hostilities <b>loomed,</b> the battleship was instead dispatched north to Scapa Flow, and was at anchor there when war was declared on 3 September.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II <b>loomed.</b> In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.|$|E
