5|$|The {{military}} {{decided to}} transfer Sitting Bull {{and his band}} to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. <b>Loaded</b> <b>onto</b> a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota) on the southern border of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.|$|E
5|$|The state's iron-mining {{industry}} was established {{with the discovery}} of iron in the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s, and in the Cuyuna Range in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by rail to Duluth and Two Harbors, then <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> ships and transported eastward over the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
40|$|Colloidal nanodiamonds (NDs) {{have emerged}} as highly {{versatile}} platforms for the controlled delivery of therapeutics, proteins, DNA, and other assorted biological agents. The most common mechanism of drug <b>loading</b> <b>onto</b> the ND surface depends mainly on electrostatic interactions. Although a few reports have been published on using NaCl salt to increase the drug <b>loading</b> <b>onto</b> NDs, no comprehensive mechanistic study {{with a wide range}} of anions and cations has been reported. In this work, the Hofmeister effect of inorganic salts and amino acids with different isoelectric points was employed to understand the mechanism of doxorubicin (DOXH+) <b>loading</b> <b>onto</b> NDs with different sizes. Inorganic salts including NaCl, NaNO 3, Na 2 SO 4, KCl, CaCl 2, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and amino acids with an isoelectric point above 7 (positively charged at neutral pH) increase the DOXH+ <b>loading</b> <b>onto</b> small size NDs (SNDs, 5 - 10 nm). On the other hand, amino acids with an isoelectric point below 7 (negatively charged at neutral pH) increase the DOXH+ <b>loading</b> <b>onto</b> large size NDs (LNDs, 80 - 100 nm). © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

5|$|Although {{bought at}} the auction (it is {{believed}} by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by rail to Swansea and <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, {{no trace of the}} locomotive, or evidence of its fate, has so far been found.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 slate {{duty was}} abolished, and this helped {{to produce a}} rapid {{expansion}} in the industry, particularly since the duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> ships. The railway was graded so that loaded slate waggons could be run by gravity downhill {{all the way from}} Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in 'dandy' waggons. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had to cart the slate to Maentwrog to be <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> small boats and taken down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry. A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for slate for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog slate.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to NIT, Norfolk {{is home to}} Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual throughput of approximately 48,000,000 tons. Bituminous coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The coal is <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> trains {{and sent to the}} port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.|$|E

It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a flank guard on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern prong of the attack on the Czech capital. Advancing against little organized resistance, the 331st was on the outskirts of the town of Schlewitz when it got word of the German surrender.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July, the Danish ship Ark Futura {{arrived in}} the Italian port of Gioia Tauro, {{carrying}} the chemical weapons, which were then <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> the U.S. ship Cape Ray. The Cape Ray was equipped with two Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems capable of neutralizing the poisonous substances and converting them into industrial waste. On 19 July 2014, around 250 protesters gathered at the Souda base to protest {{the elimination of the}} chemical weapons in the nearby region of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

The last 8% of the chemical stockpile was <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> ships at Latakia. The most toxic chemicals, including sarin precursors and sulphur mustard, were destroyed by 18 August aboard the US naval vessel MV Cape Ray. The remaining were destroyed in the US, Great Britain and Finland. On 4 January 2015, the OPCW confirmed that the destruction was completed.|$|E

After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate, the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general and also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in January 1944. On 18 January, he set out for London with {{two and a half}} tons of personal baggage <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. The staff of the Chief-of-Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC) was already active, and he had been planning the Overlord operation for some time.|$|E
5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> train shuttles in Calais.|$|E

5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} German {{aircraft}} designs {{that participated in}} the Condor Legion, {{and as part of}} other German involvement in the Spanish Civil War, a single Ju 87 A-0 (the V4 prototype) was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the VJ/88, the experimental Staffel of the Legion's fighter wing. The aircraft was secretly <b>loaded</b> <b>onto</b> the ship Usaramo and departed Hamburg harbor on the night of 1 August 1936, arriving in Cádiz five days later. The only known information pertaining to its combat career in Spain is that it was piloted by Unteroffizier Herman Beuer, and took part in the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao in 1937. Presumably the aircraft was then secretly returned to Germany.|$|E
