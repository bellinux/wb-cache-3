5|$|Southern's {{emergency}} call {{is transferred from}} his superior, Sir William Frazer, to International Rescue. Landing outside the Plutonium Store in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, Scott and Virgil use the <b>Laser</b> <b>Cutter</b> Vehicle to burn through the doors. Inside the vault, Virgil releases Southern from the robot. As the time nears 30 minutes past noon, Scott, in possession of the three bracelets, takes off in Thunderbird 1; he jettisons them over the sea, where they explode harmlessly. On Jeff's orders, Lady Penelope and Parker intercept the Erdman Gang at their rendezvous and use FAB 1's cannon to shoot down the leader, Dempsey and Kenyon before they can escape in a helijet. Southern recovers from his ordeal at the Creighton-Ward Mansion.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 September 2007, a {{small fire}} {{broke out in the}} Technology Department's [...] "laser room", the {{location}} of a relatively small <b>laser</b> <b>cutter.</b> The fire itself was extinguished immediately after it was found, but the fire alarm was still raised at around 1:35pm. The school was evacuated, and the fire brigade called to ensure that the structure was sound. The building was declared safe soon after. The Technology Department was closed for a short while to assess the damage. The <b>laser</b> <b>cutter,</b> estimated to be worth £24,500 was destroyed, while three panes of window glass were also damaged. The damage of the fire slowed down GCSE students projects, some of whom were 100% reliant on the <b>laser</b> <b>cutter.</b>|$|E
