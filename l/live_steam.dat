5|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature <b>live</b> <b>steam</b> railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we have {{discussed}} the design constraints of a computer vision based mobile robot and processing the real time video received from the mobile robot. The focus is on applying DWT algorithm on the real time video so that memory size required for storage is reduced. The mobile robot which feeds in the <b>live</b> <b>steaming</b> of video of surrounding area is of low quality, which has to be processed preciously. Storage of video with respect to memory is also another issue which is addressed. Memory controller is also used as an interface between memory and the processing element...|$|R
25|$|The last {{design by}} model {{engineer}} Curly Lawrence ("LBSC") {{was for a}} <b>live</b> <b>steam</b> 3½ inch gauge model BR 9F Locomotive. The design was unfinished before his death on 4 November 1967. The design was subsequently completed by Martin Evans.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>live</b> <b>steam</b> and {{exhaust steam}} {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to <b>live</b> <b>steam</b> injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E

[...] Beginning in the 1966, and using original British Railways and Associated Locomotive Equipment (a subsidiary of Heenan & Froude) drawings, Denis built three Dukes each complete with fully working Caprotti valve gear, first in 7¼ inch gauge, and then 5 and 3½ inch gauges. [...] The 7¼ inch gauge Duke won multiple awards at the 48th Model Engineer Exhibition in 1979, as did his 3½ inch gauge locomotive at the 61st Model Engineer Exhibition in 1992.|$|E
500|$|At its peak, {{the farm}} {{delivered}} milk to areas from Albany to New York City. After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building, {{where it was}} poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced—with compressed air at [...] per minute—through sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled. The bottles were sealed with parchment circles with the supervising commission's certification and the date, and then put in boxes with ice. The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with <b>live</b> <b>steam.</b> The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with coving (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning. Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization.|$|E

40|$|Parry {{contributes}} to the Lansdown Centre's work in sonic arts (and music), particularly in relation to novel approaches to space and place. The chapter (2003) develops ideas presented in an invited paper at the 1999 Klagngart Kongress in Osnabrueck, Germany in which the author discussed two of his site-specific sound installations, <b>Living</b> <b>Steam</b> at the Kew Bridge Steam Museum (Sonic Arts Network commission with funds from ACE) and Boomtown (Oldham Borough commission) at the Oldham Art Gallery. The chapter explores the work {{in relation to the}} use of “musicalised” real-world recordings in a site-specific context. Harold Rosenberg's ideas around the “anxious object” in art (Rosenberg 1966) are applied to sonic objects presented in non-traditional musical contexts, specifically those in which their real-world counterparts normally occur. In the <b>Living</b> <b>Steam</b> installation the treated sounds of steam engines are relocated in their source-environment through concealed loudspeakers, so interacting with the actual soundscape of the museum and the working engines. These ideas form part of a wider discussion of spatial sound composition in which three categories of spatialisation are identified: representational space, metaphorical space and structural space. These ideas have informed the author's subsequent spatial composition {{in a wide variety of}} contexts including the performance installation Triptych (Wellcome Trust commission for performance in the Science Museum's Wellcome Wing 2001) and the Stairwell Installation (2005) for the National Maritime Museum's major Nelson and Napoleon exhibition, in which two exhibition spaces were linked through a progressive sound installation in which the visitor's navigation of the space creates a musical and narrative structure. They also occur in a number of works for concert performance such as Fuzzy Logic for Balinese Gamelan, Ambisonic Sound, Strings and Brass, commissioned by the LSO Discovery programme for their Community Gamelan group and members of the orchestra...|$|R

500|$|By 1948, Walt Disney's {{interest}} in model trains was evolving into an {{interest in}} larger, ridable miniature trains after observing the trains and backyard railroad layouts of several hobbyists, including Disney animator Ollie Johnston. In 1949, after purchasing [...] of vacant land in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, he started construction on a new residence {{for himself and his}} family, and on the elaborate [...] gauge ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad behind it. The railroad featured a set of freight cars pulled by the Lilly Belle, a 1:8-scale <b>live</b> <b>steam</b> locomotive named after Disney's wife Lillian and built by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team led by Roger E. Broggie. The locomotive's design, chosen by Walt Disney after seeing a smaller locomotive model with the same design at the home of rail historian Gerald M. Best, was based directly on copies of the blueprints for the Central Pacific No. 173, a steam locomotive rebuilt by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1872. The Lilly Belle first ran on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad on May 7, 1950. Walt Disney's backyard railroad attracted visitors interested in riding his miniature steam train, and on weekends, when the railroad was operating, he allowed them to do so, even allowing some to become [...] "guest engineers" [...] and drive the train. In early 1953, after a visitor drove the Lilly Belle too fast along a curve, causing it to derail and injure a five-year-old girl, Walt Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the Carolwood Pacific Railroad and placed the locomotive in storage.|$|E
