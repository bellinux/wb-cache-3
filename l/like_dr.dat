5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were highly prized. There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock acts <b>like</b> <b>Dr</b> Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. With the rise of disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> William M. Gray, {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently {{on the rise in}} Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E

She {{has been a good}} deal secluded, until quite lately, they say, on account of her father's death and brother's worse than death, which may account in part for any {{backwardness}} you may have observed. As to her 'not <b>liking</b> <b>Dr.</b> Braun,' do you believe in anybody's not <b>liking</b> <b>Dr.</b> Braun? I don't quite.

His efforts to topple Saddam's regime resulted in his assassination in 1992. To avoid backlash, the assassination was disguised as a car accident.|$|R
5|$|The {{historical}} {{value of}} the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must {{have been based on}} solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an ideal world rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to civvy street in 1946 with a profound depression {{and a belief}} that a head wound he had sustained had disfigured him on the inside as well as (temporarily) on the outside, and would cause him to turn evil <b>like</b> <b>Dr</b> Jekyll becoming Mr Hyde. He received treatment, was institutionalised for a time, and made a full recovery, but perhaps his sympathetic visual treatment of Grendel, the monster from Beowulf, owes something to this period of his life.|$|E

25|$|Few {{figures in}} 20th century Ireland were as {{controversial}} as Noël Browne. To his supporters {{he was a}} dynamic liberal who stood up to conservative and reactionary Catholicism.

Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986 with the publishing of his autobiography Against the Tide. Historians <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Ruth Barrington, who had written extensively about Irish health policy and had access to the files from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book's reliability.|$|E

25|$|Knuckles' early adventures {{typically}} involved protecting Angel Island or {{the various}} Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on {{different areas of}} the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to Portuguese rule in Goa in the 20th {{century was}} pioneered by Tristão de Bragança Cunha, a French-educated Goan {{engineer}} {{who founded the}} Goa Congress Committee in Portuguese India in 1928. Cunha released a booklet called 'Four hundred years of Foreign Rule', and a pamphlet, 'Denationalisation of Goa', intended to sensitise Goans to the oppression of Portuguese rule. Messages of solidarity were received by the Goa Congress Committee from leading figures in the Indian independence movement <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Rajendra Prasad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and several others. On 12 October 1938, Cunha {{with other members of}} the Goa Congress Committee met Subhas Chandra Bose, the President of the Indian National Congress, and on his advice, opened a Branch Office of the Goa Congress Committee at 21, Dalal Street, Bombay. The Goa Congress was also made affiliate to the Indian National Congress and Cunha was selected its first President.|$|E

500|$|Benson {{describes}} the [...] "Fleming Sweep" [...] as taking the reader from one chapter to another using [...] "hooks" [...] {{at the end}} of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the [...] "Fleming Sweep briskly propels the plot" [...] of Dr. No through chapters that are longer than in previous Bond novels; the cultural historian Jeremy Black also <b>likes</b> <b>Dr.</b> Nos pacing, despite considering it inconsistent in places. Winder believes that the novel's plotting is chaotic, although he still feels the book [...] "can be read over and over again with immense pleasure".|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} very positive reviews by critics and audiences alike. Many described initial misgivings that the musical concept {{would make the}} episode seem gimmicky, but these fears were, for the most part, put to rest {{by the fact that}} the episode was [...] "logically insane"; the singing came about organically (through the brain aneurysm), and, despite the singing, the episode fit into the Scrubs continuity. Many noted that the songs fit the characters (<b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> Cox's [...] "Rant Song"), and that story arcs actually advanced in the episode (Carla returning to the hospital, and J.D. and Elliot no longer living together).|$|E

500|$|The {{water quality}} has also {{deteriorated}} due to intense pollution {{caused by the}} untreated sewage and solid waste that is fed into the lake from the peripheral areas and from the settlements and houseboats. Besides, some experts <b>like</b> <b>Dr.</b> A.A. Kazmi (Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee and {{in charge of the}} Environmental Engineering Lab) believe that deforestation in the catchment of Dal and Telbal stream may have led to more nitrogen and phosphorus-rich run-off, further aiding eutrophication. [...] Encroachments of water channels and consequent clogging has diminished the circulation and inflows into the lake, so with the building up of phosphates and nitrogen, this has led to extensive weed growth and consequences on the biodiversity of the lake.|$|E
