5|$|The {{station at}} Brattøra has had four names, {{following}} the name {{changes of the}} city. It was opened as Throndhjem, changed in 1894 to Trondhjem, on 1 January 1930 to Nidaros and to Trondheim on 6 March 1931. The station at Brattøra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem Ø. The freight station for the Røros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem Ø, just <b>like</b> <b>today.</b> While there were two stations in 1882–84, they were 'probably' referred to as Brattøra and Kalvskinnet.|$|E
25|$|Palynological {{evidence}} suggest that, <b>like</b> <b>today,</b> {{the surrounding}} area during the time associated with Paleolithic hominin finds was composed primarily of dry forest steppe, albeit in a slightly colder and more humid context.|$|E
25|$|Messrs Julin Kennedy Sahlin from Pittsburgh {{prepared}} the first {{layout of the}} town of Jamshedpur. What the city looks <b>like</b> <b>today</b> is a testament to their visionary plans. Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks {{are thought}} to have made red as well as rosé and white wines. <b>Like</b> <b>today,</b> these varied in quality from common table wine to {{valuable}} vintages. It was generally considered that the best wines came from Thásos, Lesbos and Chios.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Ocean {{between the}} huge ice sheets of America and Eurasia was not frozen throughout, but <b>like</b> <b>today</b> {{probably}} was only covered by relatively shallow ice, subject to seasonal changes and riddled with icebergs calving {{from the surrounding}} ice sheets. According to the sediment composition retrieved from deep-sea cores there must even have been times of seasonally open waters.|$|E
25|$|As first German {{confederation}} {{of unions}} at 14 March 1892 the Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands {{was founded in}} Halberstadt. It represented 57 national and some local unions with approximate 300,000 people in total. After World War I unions had to reorganise. During a congress in Nuremberg from 30 June until 5 July 1919 the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (ADGB) was founded as an umbrella organisation of 52 unions with more than 3million members. The ADGB {{may be seen as}} predecessor of today's DGB. <b>Like</b> <b>today,</b> there also existed a conservative counterpart of lesser importance.|$|E

50|$|Much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> Intel High Definition Audio, {{the actual}} {{hardware}} was standardized as well. WSS {{was based on}} Analog Devices AD1848 codec chip with Yamaha OPL3 (YMF262-M) FM synthesis sound chip.|$|R
50|$|CaseWare Amplify Control also {{included}} a distributed build automation and continuous integration system, much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> Maven and Hudson tools. It was first released in 1990. Later a bug tracking system was also built on the platform.|$|R
25|$|The {{first people}} in Nord-Trøndelag settled in Flatanger and Leka between 7500 and 6000BCE, and were {{migrating}} northwards along the coast. In {{about the same}} time, people moved upwards along the Trondheimsfjord. The first farmers migrated to Stjørdal before 2000BCE in the Stone Age. Early agriculture was based mostly on animals, which allowed people to remain nomads and combine stockbreeding with gathering. Around 2300 to 2000BCE, the spruce spread into the county, and by 1300 CE, the landscape was dominated by spruce <b>like</b> <b>today.</b> During the early Bronze Age, from 1800 to1000 BCE, the first large graves {{were built in the}} Trondheimsfjord area. The earliest species of cereals grown was barley around 500BCE, which was later supplemented with other cereals.|$|E
25|$|Glaciation of the Southern Hemisphere {{was less}} {{extensive}} because of current configuration of continents. Ice sheets {{existed in the}} Andes (Patagonian Ice Sheet), where six glacier advances between 31,500 and 11,900BCE in the Chilean Andes have been reported. Antarctica was entirely glaciated, much <b>like</b> <b>today,</b> but the ice sheet left no uncovered area. In mainland Australia {{only a very small}} area in the vicinity of Mount Kosciuszko was glaciated, whereas in Tasmania glaciation was more widespread. An ice sheet formed in New Zealand, covering all of the Southern Alps, where at least three glacial advances can be distinguished. Local ice caps existed in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where in three ice areas remnants of the Pleistocene glaciers are still preserved today.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his main solo career, Matthew West has also written songs for other bands and musicians, including Mark Schultz, Mandisa, Jump5, Sara Groves, Joy Williams, Casting Crowns, Salvador, Natalie Grant, Danny Gokey, PureNRG, and Point of Grace, as well as mainstream country act, Billy Ray Cyrus. Rascal Flatts recorded West's song, [...] "The Day Before You", on their album, Feels <b>Like</b> <b>Today.</b> He co-wrote [...] "Voice of a Savior" [...] by Mandisa and [...] "Thank You" [...] by 33Miles, {{both of which were}} released as singles in early 2008.|$|E
50|$|Distinguished {{visitors}} were ushered into longhouses with great ceremony, {{accompanied by the}} firing of the longhouse's cannon, much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> twenty-one gun salute. These cannon were a display of the status and wealth {{of the extended family}} that controlled the longhouse.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1920s, the Targa Florio {{had become}} one of Europe's most {{important}} races, as neither the 24 Hours of Le Mans nor the Mille Miglia had been established yet. Grand Prix races were still isolated events, not a series <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> F1.|$|R
50|$|A cestus or caestus is {{an ancient}} battle glove, {{sometimes}} used in pankration. They were worn <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> boxing gloves, but were made with leather strips and sometimes filled with iron plates or fitted with blades or spikes, and used as weapons.|$|R
500|$|When the Ottawa Hockey Club began play, {{there was}} no {{division}} between the ice surface and the stands <b>like</b> <b>today.</b> The fans became quite wet in the times when the temperature was warm. In the 1903 Stanley Cup Final against the Montreal Victorias, the Governor-General (who had a private box seat at the ice's edge) is recorded as getting wet from the play. On another occasion, in the 1906 Stanley Cup Final against the Wanderers, the Governor-General's top hat was knocked off by the stick of Ernie [...] "Moose" [...] Johnson. The top hat was taken by a fan and given to Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other artists}} {{appear on the}} soundtrack. Billy Ray Cyrus' song on the album, [...] "Back to Tennessee", is the title track of his {{eleventh}} studio album. Written by Cyrus, Tamara Dunn and Matthew Wilder, the song reflects the desire of both Cyrus and his character in the film, Robbie Ray Stewart, {{to return to their}} roots. Disney artist Steve Rushton sings [...] "Everything I Want" [...] and [...] "Game Over". Rascal Flatts perform acoustic versions of previous efforts originally released on Feels <b>Like</b> <b>Today</b> (2004) and Me and My Gang (2006). When approached about participating in the soundtrack, Taylor Swift sent her ballad [...] "Crazier" [...] because it [...] "was perfect to fall in love to". Swift also shares a writing credit with Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls on the opening track [...] "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home".|$|E
500|$|Adams {{entered the}} 1990s {{with the release}} of Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), which {{contained}} [...] "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", the theme song for the film [...] The album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

His seventh studio album, 18 til I Die, was released in 1996. It sold five million copies worldwide and was certified platinum in the United States. MTV Unplugged, an acoustic live album released in 1997, reached the top ten in four countries while selling two million copies in Europe. Adams' eighth studio album, On a Day <b>Like</b> <b>Today</b> (1998), was certified double-platinum by the CRIA and platinum by the IFPI Platinum Europe Awards. His second compilation album, The Best of Me (1999), sold two million copies in Europe and went three-times platinum in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Pterosaurs like Boreopterus are {{interpreted}} by Unwin as soaring animals, <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> albatrosses and frigatebirds. However, {{it has also}} been suggested that boreopterids foraged while swimming, trapping small prey with their needle-like teeth, a method similar to that of modern Platanista dolphins.|$|R
60|$|The {{result was}} that {{they went back to}} the house for breakfast with a never-again feeling, and at the {{earliest}} possible moment met to debate as to what was to be done about it. At all costs another experience <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> must be avoided.|$|R
50|$|About 24 {{million years}} ago {{at the end of the}} Oligocene, Oregon had started to look how it is today and the Willamette Bay finally became the Willamette Valley by drying up and being raised above sea level, after {{assuming}} a shape much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> Puget Sound.|$|R
2500|$|On a Day <b>Like</b> <b>Today</b> was {{released}} in 1998 and the release coincided with his contract being sold to Interscope Records. Despite Interscope's involvement or lack of, On a Day <b>Like</b> <b>Today</b> enjoyed tremendous success internationally, entering the Top 5 in Germany and was certified platinum in the UK. It generated two British Top 10 singles: [...] "Cloud Number Nine" [...] and [...] "When You're Gone", which featured Melanie C of The Spice Girls.|$|E

2500|$|After the battle, all of Yuan Shao's warhorses were dead, corpses piled {{across the}} fields, and blood flowed like creeks. Yuan Xi and Gao Gan were wounded by arrows, and once together, Yuan Shao hugged his three sons and cried. Soon afterwards, he fainted and spat blood ceaselessly. In anguish, he said, [...] "I have campaigned on several occasions, never have I {{suffered}} <b>like</b> <b>today!</b> Heaven dooms me! You [...] shall {{return to your}} home provinces and promise to settle matters with Cao once and for all!" ...|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{developments}} {{were included in the}} Alto, which added the now familiar Stanford Research Institute (SRI) developed mouse, unifying into a single model most aspects of now-standard personal computer use. The integration of Ethernet prompted the development of the PARC Universal Packet architecture, much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> Internet.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the Imperial Japanese Navy had no LSOs. Instead, its {{carriers}} {{employed a}} system of colored lights much <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> general aviation runway edge lights at most airports.

2500|$|Merchants and {{artisans}} {{from many}} parts of the Roman world established themselves in coastal Libya. Former soldiers were settled in the [...] "Centenaria" [...] area of Tripolitania, and the arid land was developed. Dams and cisterns were built in the Wadi Ghirza (then not dry <b>like</b> <b>today)</b> to regulate the flash floods. These structures are still visible As a consequence the area south of Leptis Magna became an important exporter of olive oil and cereals to Rome and the province was greatly [...] "romanized", according to Theodore Mommsen.|$|E
2500|$|The first Bengal Artillery {{unit was}} raised in 1749. [...] It was {{originally}} titled 1 Company, Bengal Artillery and was quartered in Fort William, Calcutta. [...] The early records of the Battery were destroyed in the sacking of Calcutta in 1749, so the details are limited. [...] However, {{it is known that}} the Battery was commanded by Capt Witherington and consisted of 5 other officers, 4 sergeant-bombardiers, 4 corporals, 100 gunners and 2 drummers. [...] The company, much as <b>like</b> <b>today,</b> was double-hatted; as well as carrying out the normal artillery duties it also performed engineering and labouring tasks.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{language}} {{is the importance of}} using poetry in conversations. Modifying or rephrasing a classic poem according to the current situation was expected behavior in Heian court life, and often served to communicate thinly veiled allusions. The poems in the Genji are often in the classic Japanese tanka form. Many of the poems were well known to the intended audience, so usually only the first few lines are given and the reader is supposed to complete the thought themselves, much <b>like</b> <b>today</b> we could say [...] "when in Rome..." [...] and leave the rest of the saying ("...do as the Romans do") unspoken.|$|E
5000|$|Ambassador Boubacar Gaoussou Diarra, {{representing}} the African Union, said [...] "Indiscriminate attacks on public places <b>like</b> <b>today's</b> incident cannot be condoned.
