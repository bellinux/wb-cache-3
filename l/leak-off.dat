50|$|An {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} a casing cement job {{as well as of}} the formation is extremely important during the drilling of a well and for subsequent work. The Information resulting from Formation Integrity Tests (FIT) is used throughout the life of the well and also for nearby wells. Casing depths, well control options, formation fracture pressures and limiting fluid weights may be based on this information. To determine the strength and integrity of a formation, a Leak Off Test (LOT) or a Formation Integrity Test (FIT) may be performed. This test is first: a method of checking the cement seal between casing and the formation, and second: determining the pressure and/or fluid weight the test zone below the casing can sustain. Whichever test is performed, some general points should be observed. The fluid in the well should be circulated clean to ensure it is of a known and consistent density. If mud is used for the test, it should be properly conditioned and gel strengths minimized. The pump used should be a high-pressure, low-volume test or cementing pump. Rig pumps can be used if the rig has electric drives on the mud pumps, and they can be slowly rolled over. If the rig pump must be used and the pump cannot be easily controlled at low rates, then the <b>leak-off</b> technique must be modified.

For the double-porosity reservoir fluid <b>leak-off</b> calculation model, many scholars have studied it.

Although many <b>leak-off</b> models have been published, none of the models fully coupled the transient fluid flow modeling with heat transfer, chemical-potential equilibrium and natural-fracture dilation phenomena. In this paper, a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, thermo-poroelastic rock mechanics, and non-isothermal chemical-potential equations is presented to simulate the water <b>leak-off</b> process in shale gas reservoirs. The THMC model takes into account a triple-porosity medium, which includes hydraulic fractures, natural fractures and shale matrix. The <b>leak-off</b> simulation with the THMC model involves all the important processes in this triple-porosity medium, including: (1) water transport driven by hydraulic, capillary, chemical and thermal osmotic convections; (2) gas transport induced by both hydraulic pressure driven convection and adsorption; (3) heat transport driven by thermal convection and conduction; and (4) natural-fracture dilation considered as a thermo-poroelastic rock deformation.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{an important}} method used to enhance the recovery {{of oil and gas}} from reservoirs, especially for low permeability formations. The distribution of pressure in fractures and fracture geometry are needed to design conventional and unconventional hydraulic fracturing operations, fracturing during water-flooding of petroleum reservoirs, shale gas, and injection/extraction operation in a geothermal reservoir. Designing a hydraulic fracturing job requires an understanding of fracture growth as a function of treatment parameters. There are various models used to approximately define the development of fracture geometry, which can be broadly classified into 2 D and 3 D categories. 2 D models include, the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) fracture model, and the Khristianovic-Geertsma-de. Klerk (KGD) fracture model, and the radial model. 3 D models include fully 3 D models and pseudo-three-dimensional (P- 3 D) models. The P- 3 D model is used in the oil industry due to its simplification of height growth at the wellbore and along the fracture length in multi-layered formations. In this research, the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) fracture model is adopted to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation and recession, and the pressure changing history. Two different approaches to fluid <b>leak-off</b> are considered, which are the classical Carter's <b>leak-off</b> theory with a constant <b>leak-off</b> coefficient, and Pressure-dependent <b>leak-off</b> theory. Existence of poroelastic effect in the reservoir is also considered.

A short and wide fracture will be created when we use the high viscosity fracturing fluid or the formation has low shear modulus. While, the fracture length, width, fracturing pressure, and the fracture closure time increase as the fluid <b>leak-off</b> coefficient is decreased. In addition, an algorithm is developed for the post-fracture pressure-transient analysis to calculate formation permeability.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, 2013. The aim of the thesis is to derive group invariant, exact, approximate analytical and numerical solutions for a two-dimensional laminar, non-Newtonian pre-existing hydraulic fracture propagating in impermeable and permeable elastic media. The fracture {{is driven by the}} injection of an incompressible, viscous non-Newtonian fluid of power law rheology in which the fluid viscosity depends on the magnitude of the shear rate and on the power law index n > 0. By the application of lubrication theory, a nonlinear diffusion equation relating the half-width of the fracture to the fluid pressure is obtained. When the interface is permeable the nonlinear diffusion equation has a <b>leak-off</b> velocity sink term. The half-width of the fracture and the net fluid pressure are linearly related through the PKN approximation. A condition, {{in the form of a}} first order partial differential equation for the <b>leak-off</b> velocity, is obtained for the nonlinear diffusion equation to have Lie point symmetries. The general form of the <b>leak-off</b> velocity is derived. Using the Lie point symmetries the problem is reduced to a boundary value problem for a second order ordinary differential equation. The <b>leak-off</b> velocity is further specified by assuming that it is proportional to the fracture half-width. Only fluid injection at the fracture entry is considered. This is the case of practical importance in industry. Two exact analytical solutions are derived. In the first solution there is no fluid injection at the fracture entry while in the second solution the fluid velocity averaged over the width of the fracture is constant along the length of the fracture. For other working conditions at the fracture entry the problem is solved numerically by transforming the boundary value problem to a pair of initial value problems. The numerical solution is matched to the asymptotic solution at the fracture tip. Since the fracture is thin the fluid velocity averaged over the width of the fracture is considered. For the two analytical solutions the ratio of the averaged fluid velocity to the velocity of the fracture tip varies linearly along the fracture. For other working conditions the variation is approximately linear. Using this observation approximate analytical solutions are derived for the fracture half-width. The approximate analytical solutions are compared with the numerical solutions and found to be accurate over a wide range of values of the power-law index n and <b>leak-off</b> parameter β. The conservation laws for the nonlinear diffusion equation are investigated. When there is fluid <b>leak-off</b> conservation laws of two kinds are found which depend in which component of the conserved vector the <b>leak-off</b> term is included. For a Newtonian fluid two conservation laws of each kind are found. For a non-Newtonian fluid the second conservation law does not exist.

In some areas the tectonic regime has been inferred either from fault plane solutions of M≥ 4 earthquakes or from stress inversions of smaller earthquakes.

Since the introduction of DFIT analysis based on G-function and its derivative, this method has become standard practice for quantifying minimum in-situ stress and <b>leak-off</b> coefficient. However, the pressure decline model that underlies the G-function plot makes two distinct and important assumptions: (1) <b>leak-off</b> is not pressure-dependent and, (2) fracture stiffness (or compliance) is assumed to be constant during fracture closure. In this study, we first review Nolte's original G-function model and examine the assumptions inherent in the model. We then present a new global pressure transient model for pressure decline after shut-in which not only preserves the physics of unsteady-state reservoir flow behavior, elastic fracture mechanics and material balance, but also incorporates the gradual changes of fracture stiffness (or compliance) due to the contact of rough fracture walls during closure. Analysis of synthetic cases, along with field data are presented to demonstrate how the coupled effects of fracture geometry, fracture surface asperities, formation properties, pore pressure and wellbore storage can impact fracturing pressure decline and the estimation of minimum in-situ stress.

In the north, formation fluids are overpressured and may locally even approach the measured <b>leak-off</b> pressures.

In this study we present a fully coupled hydro-poroelastic model which incorporates two fluids i. e. fracturing fluid and host fluid. Flow through fracture is defined based on lubrication assumption, while flow through matrix is defined as Darcy flow. The fracture discontinuity in the mechanical model is captured using eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) while the fracture propagation criterion is defined through cohesive fracture model. The discontinuous matrix fluid velocity across fracture is modelled using <b>leak-off</b> loading which couples fracture flow and matrix flow. The proposed model has been discretised using standard Galerkin method, implemented in Matlab and verified against several published solutions. Multiple hydraulic fracturing simulations are performed to show the model robustness and to illustrate how problem parameters such as injection rate and rock permeability affect the hydraulic fracturing variables i. e. injection pressure, fracture aperture and fracture length. The results show the impact of partial saturation on <b>leak-off</b> and the fact that single-phase models may underestimate the <b>leak-off...</b>|$|E

These {{may be caused by}} the following reasons: (a) the measured LOT value is the formation breakdown pressure and (b) the formation is in tectonic stress regimes.|$|E

Direction of these two horizontal stresses is determined by means of image log. Magnitude of main stress is obtained through integration of density log. Due {{to the absence of}} <b>leak-off</b> test data, magnitude of minimum and maximum horizontal stresses is estimated via equations available.|$|E

Inversion using elliptical borehole equations gives better in situ stress estimation than those from circular borehole equations.|$|E
