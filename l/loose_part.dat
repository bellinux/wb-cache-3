Williams added Gordon's death to his list of Sam's recent out-of-character actions, which already included Sam's brutal execution of Jake Talley in [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> Two" [...] and his killing of the Crossroads Demon in [...] "Bedtime Stories". However, he did point out that both characters [...] "kind of deserved to bite the dust". Peterson, too, noted the [...] "cold, dead look in Sam's eyes" [...] after the killing. On the other hand, Padalecki posited that the [...] "darker side of Sam" [...] was depicted when he killed Gordon [...] "with pure hatred", but reasoned that Sam was thinking, [...] "He's a vampire!

Kripke wanted Adrianne Palicki to reprise her role of Jessica MooreSam's deceased girlfriendbut she was busy filming for the Texas-based television series Friday Night Lights. Because Jessica was an integral aspect of the storyline, the production schedule was adjusted to accommodate the actress. The first five days of filming commenced for [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", and production then shifted to [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> One" [...] until Palicki became available for the final three days of filming. However, she was not present for filming of the episode's climax. Instead, the actress filmed her part {{in front of a}} blue screen, and was later digitally added into the scene.|$|E
500|$|The Roadhouse is {{destroyed}} by demons in [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> One", and her whereabouts are unknown throughout the episode. It {{is revealed in}} [...] "Part Two" [...] that {{she had left the}} Roadhouse to run a few errands. She, the Winchesters, and fellow hunter Bobby Singer track Azazel's activities to a cemetery surrounded by a giant devil's trap made of railroad tracks. Unable to step inside the giant symbol without becoming trapped and powerless, Azazel forces the human Jake Talley to do his bidding. The hunters are unable to stop Jake from opening a gateway to Hell in a mausoleum there, and the devil's trap is broken as hundreds of demons are released into the world. As the brothers then kill Azazel, Ellen and Bobby close the gateway.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season premiere, [...] "In My Time of Dying," [...] Sam and John awake in the {{hospital}} with only minor injuries, but a dying Dean is comatose. John secretly summons Azazel, and seems to know what the demon's plans are. He then makes a deal to save Dean, giving up his life, soul, and the Colt. Before dying, John instructs Dean to kill Sam should he become evil. The fourth season episode [...] "On the Head of a Pin" [...] reveals that the demon Alastair tortured John in Hell for over a century, with John refusing the demon's offer to stop if he himself would torture someone else. His soul escapes from Hell in {{the second season}} finale [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> 2" [...] when a gateway to Hell is opened. He saves Dean from Azazel, and distracts the demon by temporarily forcing him out of his host, long enough for Dean to kill Azazel with the Colt when he returns to his usual body. John then gives Sam and Dean a loving smile before becoming engulfed in a white light. However, the fifth season episode [...] "Dark Side of the Moon" [...] suggests that he might not be in Heaven.|$|E

Objective: To establish a service learning project that will inform {{the design of a}} study examining effects of a <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> playground intervention on the play of elementary school children. Methods: A <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> intervention was introduced into a school playground that consisted of an enclosed empty space containing one fixed climbing structure and a picnic table, and a larger attached enclosed lot with four picnic tables, two basketball hoops and balls. The service project was divided into three major phases: planning, acquisition of appropriate <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> play materials, and observation of these materials being used by four groups of children during four separate lunch recesses. In the planning phase, the school faculty and administration agreed to host the service learning project, help gather play materials, and make these materials available during recess times. Discussions with school personnel included issues of storage, logistics, and safety. In the acquisition phase, recycled items were gathered from several sources, including the school staff. In the observation phase, four separate groups of students were observed during a typical lunchtime recess period with <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> available. Observation of recess activity was designed to determine whether the combination and amount of play materials elicited play engagement from the students. Results: The <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> play materials were actively used by members of each grade level of elementary school children. Observations showed that some <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> materials, were more popular than others, and as the age of the children increased, certain items were not used as often. Some play items, such as a large tarp and an open-ended cardboard barrel, were popular across all age groups and elicited active play involving gross motor movements. Other items such as tires and the large tarp were used in constructive play evoking socio-dramatic use. For example, the tarp was observed draped over a picnic bench creating a “hideout. ” All of the introduced items were used at least once during the observation phase. Conclusions: This project demonstrated that a future <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> intervention study is feasible. The project indicated that children spontaneously play actively with items not normally intended for play, and it provided information that will guide the selection of materials for a future study. Future research on effects of a <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> playground intervention might focus on outcomes that measure the quality, quantity, and types of play initiated by elementary school-aged children, for example, physically active play, constructive play, and socio-dramatic play...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} shows that the type of props that typically developing children play with may affect the amount and quality of their play. Less research has been conducted on the role of <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> in the play behavior of non-typically developing children. This thesis was conducted in order to expand the knowledge on this topic. Five studies were analyzed; the published research suggests that <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> props can aid non-typically developing children to engage in dramatic play, especially when prompted...|$|R
40|$|Active {{play has}} become a {{critical}} focus in terms of physical activity participation in young children. Unstructured or child-led play offers children the opportunity {{to interact with the}} environment in a range of different ways. Unstructured materials, often called <b>loose</b> <b>parts,</b> encourage child-led play, and therefore may also promote physical activity. The purpose of this scoping review was to determine what is currently known about how <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> may influence physical activity participation. Following a systematic literature search, a total of 16 articles were retrieved, reviewed and categorized according to: (1) types of loose parts; (2) types of play; and (3) types of thinking. We found that there are currently a range of <b>loose</b> <b>parts</b> being used to support play, but {{the way in which they}} are implemented varies and there is a lack of clarity around how they might support the development of active outdoor play and physical literacy skills...|$|R
500|$|Not all scenes {{could take}} place in the studio, and some were instead shot on location. The vault scenes in [...] "Nightshifter" [...] were filmed in an actual bank safe, as {{production}} {{would not have been able}} to construct one on set. Outside shots were filmed in downtown Vancouver, forcing streets to be closed off. The crypt of [...] "Houses of the Holy" [...] was built underneath St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, with plastic used to imitate sculpted stone. Riverview Hospital—used as a filming location in previous episodes—was used for the premiere [...] "In My Time of Dying". It also functioned as a jail in [...] "Folsom Prison Blues" [...] due to, as Wanek describes, [...] "the texture on the walls, the lack of any humanity in the design, and the materials used to build it..." [...] However, the prison block was built on a sound stage. The final scenes of [...] "Simon Said" [...] were filmed at Cleveland Dam, and [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> One" [...] made use of a pre-existing set built for the Western television series Bordertown. The climax of [...] "Part Two" [...] was originally to take place in an actual cemetery, but numerous issues forced production to film the scene in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two-part finale.|$|E

Upon investigation the following day, Sam notices that both families have the same wreath over their fireplaces. The wreath {{is found to be}} made of meadowsweet, an herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice, which leads Sam to believe that they are dealing with Hold Nickar, the god of the winter solstice. Dean later admits that he wants to celebrate Christmas since it will be his last chance tohis demonic pact with a demon in [...] "All Hell Breaks <b>Loose,</b> <b>Part</b> Two" [...] only left him with one year to live.

6000|$|... 'I saw {{the heads}} of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, {{pointing}} to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is how she would look. They went off {{as if they had}} received the last possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by the <b>loose</b> <b>part</b> of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face, {{and all of a sudden}} I let him go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another second, and I heard a most {{tremendous}} crashing noise. Before I {{could think}} what to do, before I could even get up, the bush behind me seemed to burst asunder, and there appeared not eight yards from us, the great horn and wicked twinkling {{eye of a}} charging rhinoceros. He had winded us or my pipe, I do not know which, and, after the fashion of these brutes, had charged up the scent. I could not rise, I could not even get the gun up, I had no time. All that I {{was able to do}} was to roll over as far out of the monster's path as the bush would allow. Another second and he was over me, his great bulk towering above me like a mountain, and, upon my word, I could not get his smell out of my nostrils for a week. Circumstances impressed it on my memory, at least I suppose so. His hot breath blew upon my face, one of his front feet just missed my head, and his hind one actually trod upon the <b>loose</b> <b>part</b> of my trousers and pinched a little bit of my skin. I saw him pass over me lying as I was upon my back, and next second I saw something else. My men were a little behind me, and therefore straight {{in the path of the}} rhinoceros. One of them flung himself backwards into the bush, and thus avoided him. The second with a wild yell sprung to his feet, and bounded like an india-rubber ball right into the aloe bush, landing well among the spikes. But the third, it was my friend Gobo, could not by any means get away. He managed to gain his feet, and that was all. The rhinoceros was charging with his head low; his horn passed between Gobo's legs, and feeling something on his nose, he jerked it up. Away went Gobo, high into the air. He turned a complete somersault at the apex of the curve, and as he did so, I caught sight of his face. It was gray with terror, and his mouth was wide open. Down he came, right on to the great brute's back, and that broke his fall. Luckily for him the rhinoceros never turned, but crashed straight through the aloe bush, only missing the man who had jumped into it by about a yard.|$|E
