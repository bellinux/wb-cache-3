Thus, low-latitude events clearly reflect severe aridity events that occurred over Africa at the Saharan latitudes, probably induced by southward shifts of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1950 s, several areas of Mexico City have {{undergone}} accelerated ground subsidence and have developed associated fracturing and faulting. New interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (InSAR) and global positioning system (GPS) data indicate that rates of current land subsidence in Mexico City exceed 350 mm/yr. These rates are close to historical maximum levels of the mid-twentieth century, when mitigation efforts were first undertaken to reduce damage to urban infrastructure. The locus of maximum subsidence has shifted from its historical location in the old city center to the east. Correlation of our InSAR results with seismically mapped stratigraphic units suggests that subsidence is primarily controlled by compaction of Quaternary <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> and silts. We also evaluate spatial gradients in subsidence and suggest that this, rather than subsidence magnitude, is the key factor in risk assessment.

40|$|The {{study is}} an attempt to {{determine}} the size of sedimentation at the bottoms of the small kettle holes of Suwałki Landscape Park as well as the deposits that fill them. The size and the type of the transformations occurring in the kettle holes during the Holocene were determined on the basis of conducted analyses. The presence of allochtonic mineral deposits and autochtonic lacustrine and biogenic deposits was affirmed. The first group consisted of loam colluvium with a maximum thickness of up to 1 m. The other one contains <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> and silts with a maximum thickness of several tens of centimeters and gytjas and peats with a total thickness of up to 9 m. Sediments’ sequence in Snołda, Łuśnin and Linówek depressions indicated a secondary nature of the colluvium deposition in relations to the biogenic acumulation that took place throughout the Holocene. Hillslope sediments accumulation intensified only in times of economic activity growth in the area. Steep gradients of slopes and considerable depth of kettle holes favor the development of hillslope processes. The material accumulated in the depressions remains immobilised.

40|$|On {{both sides}} of the Jinsha River valley near Benzilan, Deqen, {{northwest}} of Yunnan, China, a series of varied lacustrine deposits have been discovered under the fourth terrace (Q(3) (2)). Landslide debris has been identified underlying the lacustrine deposits, indicating that the lacustrine deposits were caused by a landslide damming the Jinsha River. U-series dating shows that the age of the upper and middle portions of the lacustrine deposits on the right bank were 55. 4 +/- 3. 5 and 82. 1 +/- 6. 6 ka respectively. Lacustrine deposits on the left bank have been dated to 122. 0 +/- 12. 4 ka at the bottom, which indicates that the large-scale landslide was formed before 122. 0 +/- 12. 4 ka and the paleo-lake was developed within the early stage to the mid-stage of the Late Pleistocene. The characteristic of spore-pollen and high content of CaCO(3) in the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> reveal that the paleoclimate was semi-arid with less heavy rainfall. Considering the regional neotectonic background, the authors prefer to interpret that the Benzilan ancient landslide-dammed lake was caused by an ancient earthquake.

The lowest unit is composed of 17 m of laminated clays (Unit 1). The next exposure is a 3 m bed of poorly-sorted sand and gravel with a–b planes dipping toward the valley floor (slumped deposit). These are overlain by 37 m of sand and silt rhythmites (Unit 2), followed by 15 m of trough cross-bedded, coarse sands and gravels, with the beds oriented east to west (Unit 3). The coars-ening-upwards sequence is interpreted as a proglacial deposit of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays,</b> outwash sands, and braided stream gravels, partly buried by a post-depositional slump.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} ground water have been pumped from {{alluvial}} deposits in southern Arizona basins {{since the late}} 1940 's. Significant declines of ground-water levels have occurred {{in some of the}} basins. Ground subsidence and earth fissures, believed {{to be related to the}} large declines, have been observed. Striking examples of the earth fissuring phenomenon occur in the Stewart area of the Willcox basin. Water levels have declined more than 100 ft (30. 5 m) in the past 30 years due to agricultural pumping. Subsidence of 1 to 2 in (3. 3 to 6. 6 ft) has been recorded near the area of maximum water-level decline. Earth fissures associated with the water-level declines and subsidence have appeared at the basin floor margins near the Winchester Mountains, the Circle I Hills, and the Spike E Hills. The fissures occur in areas where alluvial sediments come into contact with Pleistocene <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays.</b> Dense mesquite forests, with some unusually large members (some of which seem to be dying), commonly mark the boundaries. Two types of fissure patterns, semipolygonal to polygonal and semicurved to linear, are found intermixed in the Stewart area. The fissures in polygonal patterns appear narrower and shallower than linear fissures. The polygonal patterns suggest that some fissures may be due to horizontal contraction of clayey sediments. Some linear fissures may be the result of differential subsidence...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of Rhassoul clay is controversial regarding {{the nature of}} the pure-mineral clay fraction which is claimed to be stevensite rather than saponite. In this study, the raw and mineral fractions were characterized using various techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR). The isolated fine clay mineral fraction contained a larger amount of Al (> 1 wt. %) than that reported for other stevensite occurrences. The 27 Al MAS NMR technique confirmed that the mineral is stevensite in which the Al is equally split between the tetrahedral and octahedral coordination sites.

40|$|The Quaternary {{history of}} the {{southern}} Baltic {{is marked by a}} complex sequence of glacial, lacustrine and marine phases. Consequently, a large number of unconformities and erosional and depositional surfaces are present in the stratigraphic record. Over 600 km of high-resolution, single-channel reflection seismic profiles were collected offshore Bornholm. A sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the seismic data, in combination with some available core data, has led to the identification of two Quaternary depositional sequences unconformably overlying the late Mesozoic deposits. The sequences contain up to nine different seismic-stratigraphic units, and are separated by sharp boundaries representing strong erosional events. The lower depositional sequence contains five units (A-E) of glacial and late-glacial origin. The unconformity, at its base is marked by a southward flowing channel drainage pattern, which {{may be related to the}} mid-Weichselian Alnarp River system. Units A and B contain till and moraine deposits, probably of middle or early-late Weichselian age. Units C-E consist of glaciolacustrine clays, and most likely represent different Baltic Ice Lake phases of the late Weichselian. The upper depositional sequence contains four units (F-I) of postglacial lacustrine and marine origin. Its sharp erosional base possibly indicates subaerial exposure. Unit F consists of backstepping delta or beach deposits, which are partially interfingered with the <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> of unit G.

Their impact on underlying aquifers and the River Murray, one of Australia's major water supplies, is of serious concern. In one such scheme, saline groundwater is pumped into Lake Mourquong, a natural groundwater discharge complex. The disposal basin is hydrodynamically restricted by low-permeability <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays,</b> {{but there are}} vulnerable areas in the southeast where the clay is apparently missing. The extent of vertical and lateral leakage of basin brines and the processes controlling their migration are examined using (1) analyses of chloride and stable isotopes of water (2 H/ 1 H and 18 O/ 16 O) to infer mixing between regional groundwater and lake water, and (2) the variable-density groundwater flow and solute-transport code SUTRA. Hydrochemical results indicate that evaporated disposal water has moved at least 100 m in an easterly direction {{and that there is}} negligible movement of brines in a southerly direction towards the River Murray. The model is used to consider various management scenarios. Salt-load movement to the River Murray was highest in a "worst-case" scenario with irrigation employed between the basin and the River Murray.

Stereonet plots produced from these measurements provided insight into patterns of varying joint strike along a horizontal transect of the observed bluff face. Taken together, these two visualizations provided a better picture of the possible chicken-and-egg interaction of the joints and bluff topography; they demonstrated the likelihood that the joint formation at the bluff was most likely to be primarily influenced by the local topography of the bluff over other sources of possible tensional stress in the immediate area...|$|E

The Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy data, though of limited value here, are not inconsistent with the inferences based on the magnetic measurements. Overall, the results obtained point to a wide range of sources for dusts both over North Africa itself and across the Atlantic.

The remaining depositional features in Lake Erie (i.e.; the Buffalo Ridge, Norfolk Moraine, Conneaut Bank, and Presque Isle Bank) were flooded. These underwater obstacles, altered water circulation patterns. forming new surface features, including Long Point, Ontario and Presque Isle, Pennsylvania.The Lake St. Clair delta was formed during this time, (5,000-3,600 YBP). The <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> under the delta have been radiocarbon dated at 7,300 YBP. Thus the deltal began during Lake Nipissing time ...|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} {{stock in the}} city of Adapazarı, Turkey, experienced widespread damage during the 1999 Marmara earthquake. An attempt was made to relate structural damage to the type of subsoil in this study. The Adapazarı soil database has been established which contains information on boreholes, cone penetration and laboratory testing since 1996 and is being updated continuously. The database has been organised using a geographical information system software. Several numeric soil profiles across the city were then taken to establish a back propagation neural network model to enable the investigator to estimate probable structural damage by referring to the type of soils at the usual footing embedment depths. Ten cross sections comprising 140 data each were used to form scanlines of 1400 m length. The input for the neural networks were the physical, mechanical and dynamic properties of soils while the resulting damage ratio data formed the target layer. Feedforward, backward spreading networks were employed in modelling. Numeric data for eight cross sections were employed for the learning process, whereas data for two cross sections were used to test the model. The proposed model was found to predict the damage ratios successfully. The general evaluation of the city following the earthquake has shown that the structural damage was minimal in a limited section of the city where the bedrock outcrops. The damage in the flat areas around the outcropping rock covered by <b>lacustrine</b> <b>clays</b> of high and intermediate plasticity was markedly low. However, damage and destruction was obvious in the central parts of the city where liquefaction and cyclic softening cases were abundant...|$|R

The southern half of the Kankakee Basin, south of the main river channel, {{is characterized by the}} fine-grained sediments that are wind driven, forming a series of broad eolian sand dunes and ridges. These are of moderate height. <b>Lacustrine</b> silts and <b>clays</b> are mixed with the various waterborne and wind driven deposits throughout the basin.|$|R
