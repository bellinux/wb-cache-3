40|$|Aspects of {{experiments}} on radiation-induced lenticular opacification {{during the life}} spans of two animal models, the New Zealand white rabbit and the rhesus monkey, are compared and contrasted with published results from a <b>life-span</b> <b>study</b> of another animal model, the beagle dog, {{and the most recent}} data from the ongoing study of the survivors from radiation exposure at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. An important connection among the three animal studies is that all the measurements of cataract indices were made by one of the authors (Lee), so variation from personal subjectivity was reduced to a minimum. The primary objective of the rabbit experiments (radiations involved: Fe- 56, Ar- 40, and Ne- 20 ions and Co- 60 gamma photons) is an evaluation of hazards to astronauts from Galactic particulate radiations. An analogous evaluation of hazards from solar flares during space flight is being made with monkeys exposed to 32, 55, 138 and 400 -MeV protons. Conclusions are drawn about the proper use of animal models to simulate radiation responses in man and the levels of radiation-induced lenticular opacification that pose risks to man in space...|$|E
40|$|In {{the fields}} of both {{cognitive}} development and cognitive aging, similar patterns of performance on selective attention tasks have been found between children and older adults. Presently, there exist few studies of selective attention across the lifespan. A 1995 study by Shapiro, Shapiro, Cointin, and Forbes addressed this absence through investigating search performance in a cross-sectional, <b>life-span</b> <b>study.</b> In the Shapiro et al. study, a compelling pattern of performance was found: in conjunction conditions, which require serial searches, older adults 2 ̆ 7 performance differed significantly from the younger adults 2 ̆ 7 performance across increasing display size only in target absent trials. The present study attempted to determine whether such differences arose from perceptual-motor (physiological) slowing. Four older adults (mean age = 68. 25 years) and seven undergraduates (mean age = 19. 57 years) volunteered. Participants responded to {{the presence or absence}} of targets within conjunction arrays of varying field and display sizes. Both reaction times (RTs) and proportion correct were measured. Overall, it was found that RTs were longest for both older and younger adults when field size and display size were large, and in target-absent trials.

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR) {{has been}} known for more than 70 years to extend life span and delay disease in rodent models. Metformin administration in rodent disease models has been shown to delay cancer incidence and progression, reduce cardiovascular disease and extend life span. To more directly test the potential of metformin supplementation (300 mg/kg/day) as a CR mimetic, <b>life-span</b> <b>studies</b> were performed in Fischer- 344 rats and compared with ad libitum feeding and CR (30 %).

Although CR significantly extended early life span (25 th quantile), metformin supplementation did not significantly increase life span at any quantile (25 th, 50 th, 75 th, or 90 th), overall or maximum life span (p >. 05) compared with control...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the effects of}} mitochondrially targeted catalase (MCAT) expression on end-of-life pathology in mice using detailed semiquantitative histopathological evaluation. We previously reported that the median and maximum life spans of MCAT mice were extended relative to those of wild-type littermates. We now report that MCAT expression is associated with reduced malignant nonhematopoietic tumor burden, reduced cardiac lesions, and a trend toward reduced systemic inflammation, with no effect on hematopoietic neoplasia or glomerulonephropathy. Combined disease burden and comorbidity are also reduced, and MCAT expression is not associated with any detrimental clinical effects. The results suggest that oxidative damage is involved in aging of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice via modulation of a subset of age-associated lesions. Antioxidant interventions targeting mitochondria may therefore be a viable strategy for prevention or postponement of some age-associated diseases. The variability of the MCAT effect across tissues, however, illustrates the importance of developing semiquantitative histopathology for assessment of comorbidity in <b>life-span</b> <b>studies.</b> Key Words: Pathology—Free radicals—Oxidative stress.

40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} of mammals to low dose-rates of ionizing radiation affects proliferating cell systems {{as a function}} of both dose-rate and the total dose accumulated. The lower the dose-rate the higher needs to be the total dose for a deterministic effect, i. e., tissue reaction to appear. Stem cells provide for proliferating, maturing and functional cells. Stem cells usually are particularly radiosensitive and damage to them may propagate to cause failure of functional cells. The paper revisits 1) medical histories with emphasis on the hemopoietic system of the victims of ten accidental chronic radiation exposures, 2) published hematological findings of long-term chronically gamma-irradiated rodents, and 3) such findings in dogs chronically exposed in large <b>life-span</b> <b>studies.</b> The data are consistent with the hypothesis that hemopoietic stem and early progenitor cells have the capacity to tolerate and adapt to being repetitively hit by energy deposition events. The data are compatible with the “injured stem cell hypothesis”, stating that radiation–injured stem cells, depending on dose-rate, may continue to deliver clones of functional cells that maintain homeostasis of hemopoiesis throughout life. Further studies perhaps on separated hemopoietic stem cells may unravel the molecular-biology mechanisms causing radiation tolerance and adaptation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Studying {{the brains}} of blind {{individuals}} pro-vides {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate how the brain changes and adapts in response to afferent (input) and efferent (output) demands. We discuss evidence suggesting that regions of the brain normally associated with the processing of visual information undergo remarkable dy-namic change in response to blindness. These neuroplastic changes implicate not only processing carried out by the remaining senses but also higher cognitive functions such as language and memory. A strong emphasis is placed on evidence obtained from advanced neuroimaging tech-niques that allow researchers to identify areas of human brain activity, as well as from lesion approaches (both reversible and irreversible) to address the functional relevance and role of these activated areas. A possible mechanism and conceptual framework for these physio-logical and behavioral changes is proposed. KEYWORDS—plasticity; visual cortex; blindness; Braille reading; verbal memory Conventional wisdom in neuroscience dictates that the brain possesses only limited capacity to reorganize itself following damage (e. g. from sensory loss or brain injury). However, more recent evidence demonstrates that the brain is capable of re-markable dynamic change and adaptation throughout the <b>life-span.</b> <b>Studying</b> individuals who are peripherally blind (e. g., from eye disease or injury) or using experimental visual deprivation (e. g., prolonged blindfolding) allow researchers to investigate adaptive brain changes and behavioral consequences in re-sponse to changes in sensory input. Lessons learned from how the brain adapts to blindness are likely to apply to other situa-tions (e. g., damage to the inner ear) and will provide novel in-sights for the development of rehabilitative and educational strategies and the advance of sensory substitution and restora...|$|R

Ranitidine and loxtidine had qualitatively different inhibitory effects on acid secretion, ranitidine being a competitive antagonist of histamine even at high concentrations, whereas the effect of loxtidine on both preparations was unsurmountable at relatively low concentrations. These results support the hypothesis that the late formation of gastric carcinoids in rats receiving loxtidine is a consequence of persistent achlorhydria caused by unsurmountable blockade of parietal cell H 2 -receptors...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{literature}} on social support processes across the <b>life-span,</b> few <b>studies</b> have examined support perceptions in societies undergoing rapid social transition. This study reports data on age, support {{and mental health}} from 2, 672 participants in four former Soviet nations. Results suggest a small but significant decline in overall support across age (r 2 : 12), with this slope significantly influenced by nationality and gender.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify and compare the expression levels of the Basigin subset of the IgSF in the brain throughout the mouse <b>life-span.</b> This <b>study</b> is the first to compare the expression of Basigin, Embigin, and Neuroplastin, which form the Basigin subset of the IgSF. The expression levels of MCT- 1, which is known to associate with Basigin in the neural retina, were also quantified to identify its role in brain tissue. Mouse brains were obtained using an accepted protocol and RNA was isolated for use in quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) using primer sets specific for Basigin, Neuroplastin gene products, Embigin, and MCT- 1. The values obtained were normalized to 18 s rRNA and standard curves were generated to extrapolate the quantity of RNA present in each sample. Neuroplastin had the highest level of expression of the members of the Basigin subset of the IgSF over time. This suggests that Neuroplastin gene products have a more prominent role in the structure and function of the mouse brain than the other two members of the Basigin subset. Although expression of Neuroplastin was relatively high in adult brain tissue, an exponential pattern of decreasing expression over time was observed. It is possible that the decrease in Neuroplastin expression observed in the brain tissue of aged individuals is associated with neural degeneration as a result of aging...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} describes many of {{the statistical}} approaches that {{are being used to}} analyze data from <b>life-span</b> animal <b>studies</b> conducted under the Department of Energy experimental radiobiology program. The methods, which are intended to be as informative as possible for assessing human health risks, account for time-related factors and competing risks, and are reasonably comparable to methods used for analyzing data from human epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to radiation. The methods described in this report model the hazard, or age-specific risk, as a function of dose and other factors such as dose rate, age at risk, and time since exposure. Both models in which the radiation risk is expressed relative to the baseline risk and models in which this risk is expressed in absolute terms are formulated. Both parametric and non-parametric models for baseline risks are considered, and several dose-response functions are suggested. Tumors in animals are not always the cause of death but instead may be found incidentally to death from other causes. This report gives detailed attention to the context of observation of tumors, and emphasizes an approach that makes use of information provided by the pathologist on whether tumors are fatal or incidental. Special cases are those in which all tumors are observed in a fatal context or in which all tumors are observed in an incidental context. Maximum likelihood theory provides the basis for fitting the suggested models and for making statistical inferences regarding parameters of these models. Approaches in which observations are grouped by intervals of time and possibly other factors are emphasized. This approach is based on iteratively reweighted least squares and uses Poisson weights for tumors considered to be fatal and binomial weights for tumors considered to be incidental...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{dealing with}} the relationship between value orientations and age suggests that, as people become older, they tend to hold to values characterized as conservative or traditional. This proposition has been tested with data for 178 top leaders in the Colombian cities of Popayan, Cali, and Medellfn. Value orientations in the Time, Activity, Man-Nature, and Relational areas were measured by the Kluclchohn instrument; in a rigorous test, modernity of values was equated with the imputed North American middle-class value hierarchy, and in a less rigorous test, with the reputedly dominant North American orientation. The data offer {{strong support for the}} hypothesized relation-ship: in general, being older tends to be strongly correlated with having more traditional as opposed to more modern value orientations. Whether this relationship exists because (I) generational cohorts cling to orientations espoused early in life or (2) aging individuals become more conservative or traditional is discussed. A LTHOUGH social values are generally recog-•*" • nized by sociologists as a fundamental dimension of the normative system of a society, little attention has been given {{to the question of how}} value profiles may be related to the age structure of a population.

Although these studies were performed over many years and at different laboratories with differing data management systems, the NRA has translated them into a standardized set of relational database tables. These can be distributed to interested individuals on written request. Specific Aims are: (1) To Maintain the Archive of Written Records from the Animal Experiments - The USTUR continued to maintain the NRA archives which consist of approximately 175 storage boxes containing laboratory notebooks, animal exposure records, animal pathologic records, and radiographs. These were stored in a 6, 000 square foot leased facility in Richland, WA. Additionally, through a collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) Low Dose Program, many of these records were scanned into digital files. These totaled 34 GB of data, which are saved in 2, 407 separate PDF files that are organized by box number and animal identification number. (2) To Maintain the Archive of Animal Tissues at Washington State University - The USTUR continued to house the NRA dog tissue collection in the leased facility.

An electronic and structured study representation format {{that can be used}} throughout the whole <b>study</b> <b>life-span</b> can improve such communication and potentially lower total study costs. The most relevant standard for representing clinical study data, applicable to unregulated as well as regulated studies, is the Operational Data Model (ODM) in development since 1999 by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). ODM’s initial objective was exchange of case report forms data but it is increasingly utilized in other contexts. An ODM extension called Study Design Model, introduced in 2011, provides additional protocol representation elements. Using a case study approach, we evaluated ODM’s ability to capture all necessary protocol elements during a complete clinical study lifecycle in the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health. ODM offers the advantage of a single format for institutions that deal with hundreds or thousands of concurrent clinical studies and maintain a data warehouse for these studies. For each study stage, we present a list of gaps in the ODM standard and identify necessary vendor or institutional extensions that can compensate for such gaps. The current version of ODM (1. 3. 2) has only partial support for study protocol and study registration data mainly because it is outside the original development goal. ODM provides comprehensive support for representation of case report forms (in both the design stage and with patient level data).

40|$|The {{functional}} {{organization of the}} brain and its variability over the <b>life-span</b> can be <b>studied</b> using resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI). It can be used to define a 2 ̆ 2 macro-connectome 2 ̆ 7 describing functional interactions in the brain at the scale of major brain regions, facilitating the description of large-scale functional systems and their change over the lifespan. The connectome typically consists of thousands of links between hundreds of brain regions, making subsequent group-level analyses difficult. Furthermore, existing methods for group-level analyses are not equipped to identify heterogeneity in patient or otherwise affected populations. ^ In this thesis, we incorporated recent advances in sparse representations for modeling spatial patterns of functional connectivity. We show that the resulting Sparse Connectivity Patterns (SCPs) are reproducible and capture major directions of variance in the data. Each SCP is associated with a scalar value that is proportional to the average connectivity within all the regions of that SCP. Thus, the SCP framework provides an interpretable basis for subsequent group-level analyses. ^ Traditional univariate approaches are limited in their ability to detect heterogeneity in diseased/aging populations in a two-group comparison framework. To address this issue, we developed a Mixture-Of-Experts (MOE) method that combines unsupervised modeling of mixtures of distributions with supervised learning of classifiers, allowing discovery of multiple disease/aging phenotypes and the affected individuals associated with each pattern. ^ We applied our methods to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), to find multiple advanced aging phenotypes. We built normative trajectories of functional and structural brain aging, which were used to identify individuals who seem resilient to aging, as well as individuals who show advanced signs of aging. Using MOE, we discovered five distinct patterns of advanced aging. Combined with neuro-cognitive data, we were able to further characterize one group as consisting of individuals with early-stage dementia. Another group had focal hippocampal atrophy, yet had higher levels of connectivity and somewhat higher cognitive performance, suggesting these individuals were recruiting their cognitive reserve to compensate for structural losses. These results demonstrate the utility of the developed methods, and pave the way for a broader understanding of the complexity of brain aging. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) has the {{essential}} role of controlling voluntary movement, {{but is also}} a crucial site for learning new motor skills and recovery of motor function after injury. The development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, particularly transcranial magnetic stimulation, has significantly contributed {{to our understanding of}} human M 1 and its ability to alter in structure and function (cortical plasticity). However, large within- and between-subject differences in the capacity for cortical plasticity exist in humans. This thesis examined factors capable of influencing human M 1 plasticity and motor learning, focussing on the effects of exercise, ageing, hand preference and genetics. Study 1 examined whether regular exercise influenced plasticity in human M 1. Individuals with increased physical activity levels had increased M 1 excitability and enhanced neuroplasticity. This was the first study to demonstrate that participation in regular physical activity offers a generalised neuroplastic enhancement within M 1. Therefore, these results suggest that participation in regular physical activity may offer global benefits to human M 1 function. Study 2 addressed the influence of age (young and old adults) and hand preference (dominant and non-dominant) on human M 1 plasticity and motor learning for a simple motor task. In contrast to previous studies, the extent of plasticity was not diminished in old compared with young adults for either hand following simple ballistic training. However, neuroplasticity was enhanced in the right hemisphere (left non-dominant hand) compared with the left hemisphere (right dominant hand) with training. This finding suggests that there is greater strengthening of corticomotor circuits for control of the left compared with the right hand during simple ballistic training. Subsequently, Study 3 examined the effect of advancing age on a complex task, which more likely engages M 1 and increases attentional demand. Following training of complex visuomotor tracking, the extent of plasticity remained similar between young and old adults, suggesting that a reduction in plasticity is not an obligatory consequence of the ageing process. The findings from Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that older adults may have a similar neuroplastic capacity under some circumstances, and identifying factors for this maintenance may guide healthy ageing interventions aimed at promoting brain health across the <b>life-span</b> In <b>Study</b> 4, {{it was found that the}} modulation of M 1 excitability was strongly influenced by a common polymorphism in the BDNF gene, but the effect was dependent on the intervention used. The most pronounced differences in plasticity between BDNF genotypes were observed following the complex motor task, but this did not influence motor learning. Although there was no effect on motor performance and short-term motor learning in healthy young subjects, the differences in brain plasticity between BDNF genotypes may be more important for the recovery of motor function after neurological injury. These findings suggest that sustained regular exercise, hand preference, and BDNF genotype contribute to the variability of M 1 plasticity in healthy adults. Therefore, to further understand factors that influence M 1 plasticity, future studies should assess these subject characteristics as potential confounding factors in the response. Furthermore, there may be potential to capitalise on these factors to optimise M 1 plasticity and recovery of motor function following neurological injury. Thesis (Ph. D.)
