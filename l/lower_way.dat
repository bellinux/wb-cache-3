We describe a procedure we call corner ranking, performed on a graph, which assigns a positive integer or ∞ to each vertex. We give a characterization of cop-win in terms of corner rank and also show that the well-known characterization of cop-win via dismantling orderings follows from our work. From the corner rank we can determine the capture time of a graph, i. e. the number of turns the cop needs to win. We describe a class of optimal cop strategies we call <b>Lower</b> <b>Way</b> strategies, and a class of optimal robber strategies we call Higher Way strategies. Roughly speaking, in a <b>Lower</b> <b>Way</b> strategy, the cop pushes the robber down to lower ranked vertices, while in a Higher Way strategy, the robber moves to a highest rank vertex that is "safe.

40|$|A indução de resistência envolve a ativação de mecanismos de defesa latentes existentes nas plantas em resposta ao tratamento com agentes bióticos ou abióticos. As plantas apresentam sistema de defesa induzível, com a finalidade de economizar energia. Desse modo, a resistência induzida em condições naturais representará custo apenas na presença do patógeno. Porém, plantas que investem seus recursos para se defenderem na ausência de patógenos arcarão com custos que refletirão na produtividade, uma vez que as alterações metabólicas que levam a resistência apresentam custo adaptativo associado, o qual pode pesar mais do que o benefício. O efeito negativo na produtividade ocorre principalmente onde indutores químicos são utilizados repetidas vezes ou em doses mais elevadas. Assim, em alguns casos podemos estar caminhando sobre uma estreita linha entre custo e benefício, onde a cura pode ser tão ruim quanto a própria doença. Neste trabalho foram conduzidos experimentos objetivando verificar alterações bioquímicas e fisiológicas, correlacionando-as com parâmetros de produção do feijoeiro entre a indução mediada por acibenzolar-S-metil (ASM), indutor químico, e, a mediada por Bacillus cereus, indutor biológico, antes da chegada do patógeno. Para tanto, foram avaliados plantas de feijão, induzidas por esses dois indutores e desafiadas com Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, para constatar a ocorrência do fenômeno da indução de resistência. Na ausência do patógeno, foram avaliados os parâmetros fisiológicos respiração e fotossíntese, determinada a atividade de enzimas envolvidas no processo de defesa como {{peroxidase}}, quitinase, &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase, fenilalanina amônia-liase e polifenoloxidase e a atividade de enzimas envolvidas no catabolismo como proteases, a síntese de compostos do metabolismo secundário como fenóis totais e lignina, a síntese de compostos do metabolismo primário como proteínas e açúcares redutores. Também se avaliou o crescimento das plantas, a produtividade e parâmetros de produção e alguns parâmetros de qualidade dos grãos. Observou-se a ocorrência da indução de resistência em função da aplicação dos dois indutores utilizados, porém para o indutor ASM a indução de resistência estava associada a aumentos na atividade de peroxidase, quitinase, &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase e proteases, aumento da síntese de lignina e redução no teor de fenóis, aumentos no teor de proteínas solúveis e de açúcares redutores nas folhas, redução do crescimento e da produtividade, aumento do teor de proteína dos grãos e redução do teor de amido nestes. Já o B. cereus apenas ocasionou aumento na atividade de peroxidase de forma atenuada e tendeu a aumentar a atividade de proteases, e reduzir o teor de proteínas nas folhas sem interferir no crescimento ou na produtividade, mas reduziu o teor de proteína dos grãos, mas aumentou o teor de amido nestes. Portanto, o indutor B. cereus, aparentemente alterou muito pouco o metabolismo do feijoeiro, sem interferir na produtividade e melhorando a qualidade da produção, enquanto que o indutor abiótico ASM alterou muito mais seu metabolismo, gerando um custo metabólico e redirecionando os fotoassimilados para investir em defesas, a custo da redução da produtividade. The induction {{of systemic}} resistance involves the activation of latent resistance mechanisms in plants against pathogens {{in response to}} the treatment with biotic or abiotic agents. The plants present latent defense system that can be activated with the goal of saving energy. Thus, the induced resistance under natural conditions will represent cost only in the pathogen presence. In this way, plants that invest their resources to defend themselves {{in the absence of the}} pathogen will pay off with costs that will reflect in productivity, since the metabolic changes that led to resistance have associated fitness cost which could outweigh the benefit. The negative effects on plant productivity usually occur when chemical inducers are used repeatedly or in higher doses, mainly in the absence of the pathogen. Thus, we can say that in some cases we can be walking on a fine line between cost and benefit, where the cure may be as bad as the disease itself. In this work, experiments were carry out to verify biochemical and physiologic alterations, correlating them with production parameters of bean plants treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), chemical inducer, or Bacillus cereus, biological inducer, before the pathogen arrival. Initially, bean plants were evaluated for induced resistance against Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli when treated with the two inducers. In the absence of the pathogen, it was evaluated the physiological parameters respiration and photosynthesis and the activity of enzymes involved in the defense as peroxidase, chitinase, &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polifenoloxidase and activity of enzymes involved in the catabolism as proteases, and the synthesis of compounds of the secondary metabolism as phenols and lignin, and the synthesis of compounds of the primary metabolism as proteins and sugars. The growth of the plants was evaluated as well as their productivity and production parameters. Some quality parameters of the grains were also evaluated. The occurrence of the resistance induced in the bean plants against the pathogens was observed for the two inducers. However, for the ASM the resistance induced was associated to increases in peroxidase, chitinase and &# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase activities, increase in the protease activity, increase in lignin synthesis and reduction in the phenol content, increase in soluble proteins and sugar content in the leaves, reduction of the growth and productivity, increasing the protein and reducing the starch content of the grains. The B. cereus only increased peroxidase activity in a <b>lower</b> <b>way</b> and showed a tendency to increase protease activity, and to reduce the protein content in the leaves without interfering in the growth or in the productivity, but it reduced the protein content and it increased the starch content of the grains. Therefore, the biotic inducer, B. cereus altered a minimum the metabolism of the bean plant, without interfering in the productivity and improving the quality of the production, while the abiotic inducer ASM altered its metabolism, generating a metabolic cost and consuming the plant photosyntathes to invest in defenses, causing a reduction in the productivity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1940. N. B. : Pages misnumbered: text {{starts on}} page 6. Three {{questions}} have concerned the {{writer in the}} preparation of this paper. First, what actually occurred when Jesus went out into the Judean wilderness? Secondly, how are we to interpret the temptations in relation to the earthly ministry of Jesus? And thirdly, what significance do the temptations hold us for today? 	In these fundamental inquiries one finds the motive which has prompted a sincere investigation into the nature of Jesus' wilderness experience. Considerable {{has been written about the}} temptations of Jesus, and innumerable interpretations have been offered in explanation of the phenomenal experience which came to him. But, for the most part, the average comment only leaves the student more bewildered than ever as to what actually happened. It is the aim of this paper, therefore, to present a rational interpretation of the wilderness episode, one which would not only be in harmony with the concepts of modern theology, but which could be justified on the basis of the best scientific research. 	The word temptation, as commonly used in the Gospel narrative, is of Greek origin, and denotes all of those experiences in life, such as pain, sorrow, and conflict by which men are proved and tested. We, therefore, must not think of Christ's temptations as being similar to ours in the sense of solicitation to sin. They had to do with the making of certain great decisions regarding the exact methods Christ would use toward realizing his ideals. The entire narrative is clothed in symbolic phraseology. Historical investigation reveals that the early Christians believed in the devil as one who manifested himself directly, if not objectively. While it is quite probable that many of them may have conceived this incident as objectively enacted, we must look upon it simply as a profound subjective experience, and embodying the utmost of reality, even though it comes to us expressed in symbolic language. 	To understand Jesus' relationship with John Baptist is of the utmost important in enabling us to comprehend the purpose of the temptations. He had been attracted to the Jordan region by John's powerful preaching, and, while he did not ask for a sin baptism, he nevertheless insisted upon being baptized, "for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. " "Us" refers to all the people and by "righteousness," he means their duty and obligation to God. 	Immediately after the baptism, he felt the bestowal of the Holy Spirit upon him. In other words, he awakened to a Messianic consciousness. For the first time the idea that he was the Messiah dawned. The shock of such an awakening was, without a doubt, tremendous. Rest and opportunity to think through the implications of his divine powers were most urgently needed. To spend forty days or so in the wilderness alone thinking through such a jarring revelation would be most natural. Being "led by the Spirit" denotes the influence which his awakening had in prompting him to seek solitude. Psychologically, he was in a wilderness of doubt and indecision, regardless of the nature of the environmental surroundings. Due to this fact we may at least be sure that he was not literally and corporeally forced into the wilderness by some objective Satanic being. 	The temptations, or trials, which followed were visions of the many concrete ways by which he might use the newly received power in achieving desired ends. In relating such an experience to others, the use of symbolic phraseology would be only natural, especially when one considers that it was the common practice of his day. 	In the first scene, temptation is represented by the natural inclination to relieve oneself of hunger. Why not use the divine power which had been given to turn stones into bread. The implication here is that such great power could be used to fill stomachs everywhere. Consequently, the purpose was indeed worthy, insofar as it went. But Jesus answered the proposal by a quotation from Deuteronomy which said that the life of man may be sustained not by bread only, but by whatever other means God shall appoint. Jesus reasoned, therefore, that to undertake to supply his own wants and the physical desires of others, would be to show a distrust for God; he woud not do it without a special dispensation. The first temptation not only evidenced his resignation to God, but it also carried a conviction which served to regulate his future conduct. 	The second scene takes place in the Temple yards at Jerusalem. Here the devil is supposed to have led Jesus, and after placing him on the pinnacle, questions him something like this: "Inasmuch as you are the Son of God, would it not be becoming for you to open your ministry in the most triumphant and conspicuous manner possible? Why not cast yourself off the pinnacle, and trust God for a safe delivery, which is a Scriptural promise? Not only will you startle the Jewish leaders, and instantly win their allegiance, but you will also be fulfilling prophecy by visibly descending from heaven in a manner harmonious to their expectations. " 	As Jesus pondered such interrogations, he came to realize that the very Scriptures which made this tempting appeal, also admonished men not to make improper trial of God's power. "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. " It was in this manner that Jesus was forewarned of a very subtle temptation with which he would later be called upon to deal. God's will meant the rejection of any inclinations he might feel toward using his miraculous powers to dazzle men. The attitudes of faith and dependence upon God could not be instilled into the hearts and minds of people by giving them signs from heaven. 	In the last scene, or temptation, Jesus faces frankly the Messianic expectations of his people. Of the many hopes held, the thought of a kingly deliverer, one who could smite the enemy and set up a reigning state, was most dominant. Long had the Jewish people expected the Promised Messiah to come and establish for them a world empire with Jerusalem and its Capital. The symbolic setting for this trial is upon an exceedingly high mountain where the tempter is represented as showing Jesus all the kingdoms of the earth. The offer is that Jesus will be given possession of all of them provided he falls down and worships Mammon (the devil). In other words, should Christ employ his divine powers to establish an earthly kingship, there would be nothing under the sun which he could not achieve. A justifiable implication to this is that after having once attained kingly glory, he might then endeavor to win the people over the joy, peace, and righteousness. However, as Jesus reasoned with the suggestion, he felt that again the Scriptures held the best answer. "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. " Paying allegiance to men is indeed honorable; but all religious homage must be paid to God alone. It was not God's will that Jesus should seek to gain spiritual goals with the methods of men. The Messianic consciousness, out of which these three great choices had come, and in which there was to be found the potential seed of truth and righteousness among men, had been given by God; therefore, Christ's first responsibility was to seek the divine will, regardless of the opposition and sacrifice which he might be called upon to make. 	A detailed study of this kind is beneficial only as we come to realize the true significance of the temptations, not only to Jesus but for our own lives. They were of invaluable consequence to Jesus; for in the choices involved, he found the direction of his ministry, and nucleus of a definite plan of work, and some important guiding principles. Never was he to exploit his divine power for the purposes of satisfying material wants only, nor was he to seek external or worldly power for the achievement of heavenly goals, nor was it ever to be his intention to avoid personal danger, when in the act of doing God's will. 	For us today, the temptations are of infinite value; first, because they serve to exalt the character of Christ, and to confirm our faith in his divine mission, and secondly, because our trials, are similar to what his were. When we distrust God's providential care, or make ostentatious remarks about our faith, or clamor for earthly rewards, we yield to the very temptations which Christ conquered. Because these are the temptations which Christ conquered. Because these are the temptations which belong to the common experience of humanity, Christ becomes more than ever our Savior by the example he gave us in overcoming them. By so doing, he proved that moral principles should take precedent over natural inclinations, and that sin is the choosing of a <b>lower</b> <b>way</b> when a higher way is possible...|$|E
