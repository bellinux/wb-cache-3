Proper {{management}} of irrigated forest plantations requires special management aids. <b>Tariff</b> <b>tables</b> {{are among the}} most important tools in managing forest plantations. This study presents <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> for Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. microtheca in the Rahad Agricultural scheme. For the construction of the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables,</b> 114 trees of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and 75 trees of E. microtheca were felled and their stems measured in order to determine their diameters at breast height and actual volumes. Using regression techniques, the relationships between diameters and volumes of the stems of each group of data were determined. The strong correlation between these parameters (diameter and volume) made it possible to construct the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables.</b> Using those <b>tariff</b> <b>tables,</b> volumes of trees of the above mentioned tree species can be calculated by measuring diameters only. This saves a lot of time spent in forest inventories. The <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> presented here are applicable for the irrigated plantations of the Rahad Agricultural Scheme. Their use elsewhere or for those of coppice origin requires careful tests. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R

40|$|This poster is a {{demonstration}} {{and discussion of}} policy issues related to Internet penetration in the European Union, particularly the <b>local</b> telephony <b>tariff</b> infrastructure needed to support (the growth of) Internet penetration rates in EU member states. The usage of the Internet for economic growth, including ecommerce, and political participation has become a much discussed public policy issue. The European Union lags behind the United States {{in the amount of}} users connected to the Internet, particularly individuals and households. European <b>local</b> telephony <b>tariff</b> reform is crucial for the growth of Internet access by individuals and households, regardless of the level of network sophistication in place. <b>Local</b> phone <b>tariffs</b> in the EU member states vary from approximately US$ 0. 25 to US$ 2. 00 per minute compared to the U. S. <b>local</b> <b>tariff</b> of US$O. OO per minute. In effect, making a 10 minute connection to a local Internet Access Provider (IAC) (which in most instances is the national telecommunications provider) in Europe can cost between US$ 2. 50 -US$ 20. 00 while in the U. S. a local connection to an IAC is cost-free. These local phone charges are in addition to rates individuals pay to an IAC for an Internet account on a (usually) monthly basis. Individuals and households have little incentive to connect to the Internet with such <b>local</b> <b>tariff</b> rates. Member states are undergoing telecommunications regulatory reform, following European-wide initiatives for restructuring the sector. <b>Local</b> telephony <b>tariff</b> reform lags, however. Unless reform occurs to decrease tariffs charged by telecommunications operators for local calls, widespread access to the Internet will remain moderately low for individuals and households...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the case}} study of a {{district}} cooling system of a university located in a South East Asia region (lat: 01 ° 29 ′; long: 110 ° 20 ′E) is presented. In general, the university has high peak ambient temperature of around 32 – 35 °C coupled with high humidity of about 85 % during afternoon period. The total electricity charge for the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Campus is very high amounting to more than $ 314, 911 per month. In this paper, a few district cooling schemes are investigated to provide “what-if analysis” {{and in order to}} minimize the overall electricity charges. Few scenarios designed for the application of centrifugal with and without ice-thermal storage (ITS) systems on the buildings were investigated. It was found that, due to the <b>local</b> <b>tariff</b> status, marginally saving can be achieved in the range of 0. 08 – 3. 13 % if a new tariff is adopted; and a total of further saving of 1. 26 – 2. 43 % if ITS is operated.

50|$|On 31 October 2011 {{a second}} {{review of the}} Feed in Tariffs for low carbon {{electricity}} generation was announced {{which is likely to}} take effect from 12 December 2011. The rates for small photovoltaic installations have been reduced from 43.3p/kWh to 21 pence/kWh. The reason for the second review is that FITs for PV were being taken up too quickly and that the DECC funding allocation for FITs was in danger of being exceeded. A further reason is that the cost of installing PV panels has reduced by around 50% and therefore the FITs had become less of an encouragement to install PV panels and more of an incitement to profit from excessive subsidies.
