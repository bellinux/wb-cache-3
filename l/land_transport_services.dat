40|$|In land freight transport, {{especially}} over longer distances, {{rail and}} waterway transport are most efficient {{with respect to}} environmental impact but are often not used due to bad price and quality conditions. Environmental efficiency is nevertheless critical not only from a political perspective, but for all economic actors. Most shippers and forwarders {{have the power to}} decide, which transport service to use for which shipment. Today, their decision is based mostly on quality and cost criteria, rather than on environmental impacts. Additional environmental information could stimulate shippers to also consider environmental impacts in their choice of transport services. A shipper survey was administered in Switzerland to evaluate relevant factors in shipper demand for <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (including the role of freight transport’s environmental performance). A set of logit models was estimated to quantify shipper willingness-to-pay for reducing the environmental impact of their shipments. Special focus was laid on differences between types of commodities shipped. Results support the hypothesis that the closer a shipper is linked to the end-consumer, the higher the sensitivity for environmental concerns. However, a cost-benefit-analysis furthermore reveals that shipper sensitivity is in most cases not able to compensate the price increases caused by transferring a shipment from the transport mode currently used to another mode with reduced environmental impact. © Association for European Transport and contributors 2009 2 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the sea transport sector. The author examines the sea transport sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the sea transport sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} Marco Polo programme –shift billions of tonnes kilometres from <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> to sea transport services making transport in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of tonnes kilometres which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of sea transport. It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the sea transport sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the sea transport sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission. The discussion is both analytical as well as speculative. The study ends with conclusions in chapter six...|$|E
40|$|Major {{roads in}} Yemen are not paved and its {{population}} density {{is high in}} coastal areas, implementing the idea of intermodal transportation method all over the coastline will give the product industries a huge advantages, due to its attractive solutions to the poor transportation infrastructure and its extremely limited road transportation system. The transport of goods in Yemen depends heavily on road transport {{in the absence of}} rail transport and limited movement by air transport and its high cost, the private sector provides the bulk of <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (goods) and has accompanied the performance of road transport activities in the absence of regulation and supervision. In this research paper the author intends to analyse and develop optimal intermodal freight transportation plans for product shipping in Yemen by using two modes of transport (truck, ship) without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes. Using intermodal transportation is vital for the product movement and supplies when single mode alternative becomes unusable or infeasible. The author intends to use quantitative research method, plan and execute fieldwork, collecting data form freight companies (truck, ship), local factories, Ministry of Transportation, etc. Compile preliminary maps of roads condition and population density. First the author intends to visit the Ministry of Transport to closely monitor the program and objectives of the Ministry and the secret of work and projects in which it is implemented and meet with its representative for the purpose of collecting data and evidence of the difficulties it faces in order to become familiar with it Comprehensively and directly on its problems and study the possible solutions., the author will intend to visit Aden and Hodeida ports to view the service and facilities for {{a better understanding of the}} processes and to examine the availabilities of intermodal transportation freight and collect data of sea freight costs. The author also intends to visit a local factory (Shamlan Industry Ltd) to explore difficulties of products movement on road, costs, etc. the author attempts to provide an in depth examination of two major tasks, single mode and multimodal. Finally the Author intends to visit Ministry of public works and roads to compile preliminary maps of roads condition and population density. As a result Intermodal transportation can be a solution when transportation resources are scarce, bad road infrastructure and mountainous terrain. The quantity of demand is usually high and required an instant solution to meet the demand of the transportation resources. After analysing data and identifying findings of two modes of transportation, the author found multimodal fright transportation cost is comparatively advantage over single transportation mode...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} trends in income and price elasticities and to offer insights for the future growth in transport use, with particular emphasis on the impact of energy and technological transitions. The results indicate that income and price elasticities of passenger transport demand in the United Kingdom were very large (3. 1 and - 1. 5, respectively) in the mid-nineteenth century, and declined since then. In 2010, long run income and price elasticity of aggregate <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> demand were estimated to be 0. 8 and - 0. 6. These trends suggest that future elasticities related to transport demand in developed economies may decline very gradually and, in developing economies, where elasticities are often larger, they will probably decline more rapidly as the economies develop. Because of the declining trends in elasticities, future energy and technological transitions are not likely to generate the growth rates in energy consumption that occurred following transitions in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, energy and technological transitions, such as the car and the airplane, appear to have delayed and probably will delay declining trends in income and price elasticity of aggregate <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> demand.

40|$|Currently, almost {{unrestricted}} {{access to}} low-lying areas of airspace creates {{an opportunity to}} use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially those capable of vertical take-off and <b>landing</b> (VTOL), in <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> UAVs become increasingly popular for transporting postal items over small, medium, and large distances. It is forecasted that, in the near future, VTOL UAVs with a high take-off weight will also deliver goods to very distant and hard-to-reach locations. Therefore, UAV navigation plays {{a very important role}} in the process of carrying out <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> At present, during the flight phase, drones make use of the integrated global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). However, the inaccuracy of GNSS + INS makes it unsuitable for landing and take-off, necessitating the guidance of a human UAV operator during those phases. Available navigation systems do not provide sufficiently high positioning accuracy for an UAV. For this reason, full automation of the landing approach is not possible. This paper puts forward a proposal to solve this problem. The authors show the structure of an autonomous system and a Doppler-based navigation procedure that allows for automatic landing approaches. An accuracy evaluation of the developed solution for VTOL is {{made on the basis of}} simulation studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is that of illustrating a methodology to derive, in terms of trade-offs, the relative values of <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> attributes for logistics operators. In particular, the analysis yields insights on the preferences for timesavings, frequency and reliability of the <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> in terms of price, of a sample of freight forwarders located in the South of Italy. The data is gathered using an Adaptive Stated Preference application and the estimates are obtained through a Tobit ML estimator on both company specific data and pooled data. The results show that frequency is the most highly rated characteristic of the service together with reliability. The value of time is significantly lower in both cases. The outcome is consistent across estimations and, substantially {{in line with the}} outcome of previous studies carried out on operators active at different levels of the transport-logistic chain.
