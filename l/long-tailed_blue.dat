He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had an old <b>long-tailed</b> <b>blue</b> jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, {{and both of them}} had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.|$|E

40|$|Each year, {{several new}} species are {{recognized}} as threatened or endangered. Today's worldwide zoos and aquariums are highly concerned in their conservation and the species kept in large numbers have high chances for possible future reintroduction. However, {{the selection of the}} species kept is decided by men and as such can be affected by human aesthetic preferences. The aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that zoos preferentially keep species that are attractive rather than endangered, using the parrot family (Psittaciformes) as an example. We collected data from 460 human respondents who evaluated the attractiveness of parrots presented on painted illustrations. After analyzing which traits affect the perceived beauty we found that humans prefer parrots that are big, <b>long-tailed</b> and colourful (<b>blue,</b> orange and yellow). There was a considerable agreement among the respondents. We repeatedly confirmed significant positive association between the perceived beauty and the size of worldwide zoo population. In addition of perceived beauty, area of distribution and body size appeared significant predictors of zoo population size. In contrast, the effects of conservation status and taxonomic uniqueness appeared insignificant. Our results suggest that zoos preferentially keep beautiful parrots and pay less [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{site has}} meadow and {{woodland}} areas with several ponds, {{and there are}} 244 species of plants, 94 of birds and 24 of butterflies. It {{has a number of}} plants which are rare in Central London, including the narrow-leaved bird's-foot-trefoil, grass vetchling and pyramidal orchid. In 1990 it was the site of the first recorded breeding of the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly.|$|E
50|$|By current {{standards}} Stuart {{was physically}} a small, wiry man, {{but in fact}} he was of average build of western European men at that time. He was able to endure privations and possessed a fierce determination which overrode any thought of personal comfort. He was not particularly gregarious; he had some good friends but seemed happiest away from crowds. He had a full dark beard and sometimes wore moleskin trousers and an unfashionable <b>long-tailed</b> <b>blue</b> coat with brass buttons and cabbage-tree hat.|$|E
40|$|Recently, it was {{reported}} that humans treat animals that they perceive as aesthetically attractive unequally to the "ugly" ones, turning more attention to them and setting more conservation programs for their protection. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the issue focusing around animal beauty in more detail by examining human preferences towards {{one of the most popular}} animal taxon, the birds. In three subsequent studies, we assessed human preferences towards selected bird species: all members of the order of parrots, randomly selected representatives of all non- passerine bird families, and all members of the vividly colored passerine family Pittidae. The first study revealed that the preferred parrots were kept in zoos in higher numbers, regardless of their conservation priority (IUCN status). We discussed possible consequences of this finding and the benefits that may arise in the light of animal conservation if this bias in species preferences was to be considered by conservation specialists. We also found that people preferred <b>long-tailed</b> parrots possessing <b>blue</b> and yellow colors over green ones, which were probably perceived as dull and uninteresting as the majority of the parrots are fully or partially green. In the next two studies, we found that shape, pattern, and overall [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), <b>long-tailed</b> <b>blue</b> (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E
