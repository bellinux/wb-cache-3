40|$|SUMMARY. —Seasonal and interannual {{variability}} in laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> in Mediterranean Spain Aims: To describe {{the variation in}} laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> (Skylark Alauda arvensis, Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, Thekla Lark Galerida theklae and Lesser Short-toed Lark Calandrella rufescens) and at two different time scales: between years (large-scale variation), and within seasons (short-scale variation). Location: Two climatically contrasting Mediterranean areas: Layna, located in {{the centre of the}} Iberian Peninsula and with a continental Mediterranean climate, and Cabo de Gata, located in the south-western Iberian Peninsula and with a semi-arid climate. Breeding Skylarks and Short-toed Larks occur in Layna, whereas breeding Thekla Larks and Lesser Short-toed Larks occur in Cabo de Gata. Methods: During the study period between 1991 - 95 in Layna and between 1991 - 94 and 1996 - 97 in Cabo de Gata, searches were carried out for nests of the four species and laying date, measured egg-length and width, and hatching asynchrony recorded. Overall, 118 nests of Skylarks, 165 of Short-toed Larks, 334 of Thekla Larks and 259 of Lesser Short-toed Larks were studied. Between-year variations in breeding parameters were analysed with General Linear Models (GLM’s). To investigate the presence or absence o...|$|R

40|$|The {{feedback}} of biodiversity on individual trait variation is a poorly explored mechanistic pathway in ecological research. We analysed {{the relationship between}} biodiversity and individual performance by focusing on vocal mimicry, a widespread interaction that may serve in intra- and interspecific communication. We studied the songs of two <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> (genus Galerida) that increase the complexity of their song displays by mimicking other birds, and analysed the influence of bird species richness on individual song performance. The diversity of mimicked species and the prevalence of mimicry increased in areas characterized by great α and γ diversity (i. e. where larks experience more diverse encounters with community members, many of them being highly vocal owing to breeding). Conversely, the variability in species-specific song components peaked where larks were abundant, probably matching the complexity of conspecific social milieu. Some trade-offs existed between homo- and heterospecific complexity, suggesting that larks could change from population- to community-driven song variation by tracking {{the composition of the}} auditory environment. Mimicry, which serves communication with conspecifics or predators, may mediate interactions, ultimately cascading to aspects of ecological diversity other than those promoting its complexity.

40|$|Immune defense {{may vary}} {{as a result}} of {{trade-offs}} with other life-history traits or in parallel with variation in antigen levels in the environment. We studied <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> (Alaudidae) in the Arabian Desert and temperate Netherlands to test opposing predictions from these two hypotheses. Based on their slower pace of life, the trade-off hypothesis predicts relatively stronger immune defenses in desert larks compared with temperate larks. However, as predicted by the antigen exposure hypothesis, reduced microbial abundances in deserts should result in desert-living larks having relatively weaker immune defenses. We quantified host-independent and host-dependent microbial abundances of culturable microbes in ambient air and from the surfaces of birds. We measured components of immunity by quantifying concentrations of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin, natural antibody-mediated agglutination titers, complement-mediated lysis titers, and the microbicidal ability of whole blood. Desert-living larks were exposed to significantly lower concentrations of airborne microbes than temperate larks, and densities of some bird-associated microbes were also lower in desert species. Haptoglobin concentrations and lysis titers were also significantly lower in desert-living larks, but other immune indexes did not differ. Thus, contrary to the trade-off hypothesis, we found little evidence that a slow pace of life predicted increased immunological investment. In contrast, and in support of the antigen exposure hypothesis, associations between microbial exposure and some immune indexes were apparent. Measures of antigen exposure, including assessment of host-independent and host-dependent microbial assemblages, can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying immunological variation. ...|$|R

The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown.

40|$|Investment in immune defences is {{predicted}} to covary {{with a variety of}} ecologically and evolutionarily relevant axes, with pace of life and environmental antigen exposure being two examples. These axes may themselves covary directly or inversely, and such relationships can lead to conflicting predictions regarding immune investment. If pace of life shapes immune investment then, following life history theory, slow-living, arid zone and tropical species should invest more in immunity than fast-living temperate species. Alternatively, if antigen exposure drives immune investment, then species in antigen-rich tropical and temperate environments are predicted to exhibit higher immune indices than species from antigen-poor arid locations. To test these contrasting predictions we investigated how variation in pace of life and antigen exposure influence immune investment in related <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> (Alaudidae) with differing life histories and predicted risks of exposure to environmental microbes and parasites. We used clutch size and total number of eggs laid per year as indicators of pace of life, and aridity, and the climatic variables that influence aridity, as correlates of antigen abundance. We quantified immune investment by measuring four indices of innate immunity. Pace of life explained little of the variation in immune investment, and only one immune measure correlated significantly with pace of life, but not in the predicted direction. Conversely, aridity, our proxy for environmental antigen exposure, was predictive of immune investment, and larks in more mesic environments had higher immune indices than those living in arid, low-risk locations. Our study suggests that abiotic environmental variables with strong ties to environmental antigen exposure can be important correlates of immunological variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{major impact}} of Plio-Pleistocene climatic {{oscillations}} {{on the current}} genetic structure of many species is widely recognised but their importance in driving speciation remains a matter of controversies. In addition, since most studies focused on Europe and North America, the influence of many other biogeographic barriers such as the Sahara remains poorly understood. In this paper, climate-driven diversification was investigated by using a comparative phylogeographic approach in combination with phenotypic data in two avian species groups distributed {{on both sides of}} the deserts belt of Africa and Asia. In particular, we tested whether: 1) vicariance diversification events are concomitant with past climatic events; and 2) current ecological factors (using climate and competition as proxies) contribute to phenotypic divergence between allopatric populations. Results Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that the crested and Thekla <b>lark</b> <b>species</b> groups diverged in the early Pliocene and that subsequent speciation events were congruent with major late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events. In particular, steep increase in aridity in Africa near 2. 8 and 1. 7 million years ago were coincident with two north-south vicariance speciation events mediated by the Sahara. Subsequent glacial cycles of the last million years seem to have shaped patterns of genetic variation within the two widespread species (G. cristata and G. theklae). The Sahara appears to have allowed dispersal from the tropical areas during climatic optima but to have isolated populations north and south of it during more arid phases. Phenotypic variation did not correlate with the history of populations, but was strongly influenced by current ecological conditions. In particular, our results suggested that (i) desert-adapted plumage evolved at least three times and (ii) variation in body size was mainly driven by interspecific competition, but the response to competition was stronger in more arid areas. Conclusion Climatic fluctuations of the Plio-Pleistocene strongly impacted diversification patterns in the Galerida larks. Firstly, we found that cladogenesis coincides with major climatic changes, and the Sahara appears to have played a key role in driving speciation events. Secondly, we found that morphology and plumage were strongly determined by ecological factors (interspecific competition, climate) following vicariance. </p...|$|R
