5|$|Phase 2: Khalid, {{aware of}} the {{situation}} at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> while the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three-pronged attack forced the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.|$|E

5|$|When Ibn al-Ashtar {{returned}} to his position, he dismounted and the Umayyads advanced. In command of the Umayyad right wing was al-Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, {{in command of the}} <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> was Umayr ibn al-Hubab, while Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l Kala' al-Himyari led the cavalry. Ubayd Allah marched along with his foot soldiers. As the battle lines became closer, al-Sakuni's right wing assaulted al-Jushami's <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b> Al-Jushami fell, followed by his son Qurrah and their guards. Consequently, Ibn al-Ashtar's <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> was driven back, but under Abdallah ibn Warqa' al-Saluli they collected themselves and joined Ibn al-Ashtar's right wing. Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar directed the right wing under al-Azdi to assault the Umayyads' <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> in the hope that Umayr ibn al-Hubab would hold true to his promise and fall back as agreed. However, Umayr held his ground and fierce fighting ensued.|$|E
5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E

5|$|Phase 2: Khalid divided his mobile guard {{into two}} {{divisions}} and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left center, while the infantry of the Muslim right center attacked from front. Under this three-pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking {{from the front}} and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b> As the Byzantine left center retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back.|$|E
5|$|When within {{missile range}} of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge. He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> {{commanded}} by Parmenion, was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central phalanx crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander {{and the rest of}} his army. When he was satisfied that the <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's <b>left</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. The right wing marched across level ground {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst the <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. The right wing thus began fighting with the Persians while the <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E
5|$|According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians.

5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the <b>left</b> <b>wing,</b> and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and hope that they had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E

5|$|Deprived of his <b>left</b> <b>wing</b> (still {{in pursuit}} of the Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre.

This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
