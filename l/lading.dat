40|$|In the {{presence}} of severe stenosis, coronary artery flow may be reduced at rest. Recent advances in echocardiography have made non-invasive sampling of velocities in the left an­terior descending coronary artery (<b>LAD)</b> possible. The aim of our study was to evaluate feasi­bility and capability of transthoracic Doppler to detect severe stenosis of the <b>LAD.</b> The study population consisted of 42 subjects with suspected coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary angiography. All had complete transthoracic echocardiography and Doppler sampling of <b>LAD</b> velocities. Quantitative cor­onary angiography was performed within 24 hours of the echocardiogram. Correlations between <b>LAD</b> velocity profile, measurements and calculations, and the angiographic results were performed. Six subjects had <b>LAD</b> occlusion, 10 had severe (> 80 % diameter) <b>LAD</b> stenosis, and 26 had normal or non-occlusive <b>LAD</b> disease. In all six subjects with <b>LAD</b> occlusion, distal <b>LAD</b> velocities were not detectable, while in the other 36 subjects, <b>LAD</b> velocities were recorded indicating the vessels were patent. In the 10 subjects with severe <b>LAD</b> stenosis, the diastolic/systolic velocity ratio was 1. 5 (P< 0. 005). Diastolic <b>LAD</b> flow was 21. 8 ± 13 mL/min in {{the presence}} of severe stenosis as compared to 48. 5 ± 20 mL/min in subjects without severe stenosis (P< 0. 0013). <b>LAD</b> velocities had high sensitiv­ity and specificity for the prediction of severe angiographic stenosis.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} which Doppler-derived flow index best predicts new distal left anterior descending coronary artery (<b>LAD)</b> stenosis in patients with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft. BackgroundThe LIMA flow measurement has been proposed to assess graft function, but it may be misleading in case of new distal <b>LAD</b> stenosis and/or competitive flow from native <b>LAD.</b> Distal <b>LAD</b> coronary flow reserve (CFR: hyperemic/baseline peak flow velocity ratio) may be more appropriate. MethodsThe LIMA and distal <b>LAD</b> flow was measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in 96 patients undergoing diagnostic/therapeutic coronary angiography, 7 ± 4 years after cardiac bypass surgery. The LIMA flow indexes (systolic-to-diastolic peak velocity ratio [SDPVr] > 1, diastolic time velocity integral fraction [DTVIf] 1 = 61 %, DTVIf < 0. 5 = 69 %, and CFR < 2 = 72 %). The LIMA flow indexes were abnormal in 17 of 19 patients with competitive graft flow, but only 5 had graft restriction, and none had significant <b>LAD</b> stenosis. In a multivariate model of new distal <b>LAD</b> stenosis prediction, competitive flow from native <b>LAD</b> reduced the predictive role of LIMA but not of <b>LAD</b> CFR. ConclusionsIn patients without competitive flow from native <b>LAD,</b> <b>LAD</b> CFR is more accurate for the detection of <b>LAD</b> stenosis than LIMA CFR. In patients with competitive graft flow, abnormal LIMA flow patterns and blunted LIMA CFR do not reflect downstream <b>LAD</b> flow as <b>LAD</b> CFR does...|$|R

40|$|A key {{requirement}} of a low-gravity screen-channel liquid acquisition device (<b>LAD)</b> {{is the need}} to retain 100 % liquid in the channel in response to propellant outflow and spacecraft maneuvers. The point at which a screen-channel <b>LAD</b> ingests vapor is known as breakdown, and can be measured several different ways such as: visual observation of bubbles in the <b>LAD</b> channel outflow; a sudden change in pressure drop between the propellant tank and <b>LAD</b> sump outlet; or, an indication by wet-dry sensors placed in the <b>LAD</b> channel or outflow stream. Here we describe a new type of sensor for gauging a screen-channel <b>LAD,</b> the Radio Frequency Mass Gauge (RFMG). The RFMG measures the natural electromagnetic modes of the screen-channel <b>LAD,</b> which is very similar to an RF waveguide, to determine the amount of propellant in the channel.
