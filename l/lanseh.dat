Under {{guidance}} Ir. Ropingi, M. Si. and Ir. Agustono, M. Si. Sub {{sector of}} foodstuff plant has {{important role in}} formation PDRB in Boyolali Regency, because the contributionthat comesfrom this sub sector is big relative compared with another sub sector of agricultural. To defend the contributionand the growthrate that haveby sub sector of foodstuff plant, so they need existence of development strategy within short-term, intermediate-term, and also long-term. Therefore, the studiesmore deepen about the development strategy of foodstuff plantcommodity are necessary done. This research aims to know the classification of foodstuff plantcommodity in Boyolali Regency based on Klassen Typology approach and the development strategy of foodstuff plantcommodity in Boyolali Regency based on Klassen Typology approach. The basic method in this research useddescriptive method. Research region is taken intentionally (purposive) in Boyolali Regency. The kind of data that used is secondary data. Secondary data consist of quantitative data and qualitative data.

The strategy for developing bloom commodity become prime commodity are the efforts to increase contribution of bloom commodity to pass increase the function of land optimally,marketing channel election, area development of mainproduction, and also reinforcement character of agriculture institution. The strategyfor developing backward commodity become bloom commodity isefforts to increase growth rate of backward commodity passes depreciation the distribution level of plantintruder organism, wisdom of price input, market information collecting, and also tumpangsari. The long-termdevelopment strategy consists of two alternative, they are the strategy for developing backward commodity become bloom commodity bloom and the development strategy of prime commodity. The strategy for developing backward commodity become bloom commodity is efforts to increase backward commodity growth rate passes farmer total increasing, apply " 6 correct" method, vast merging plant area, and alsoincrease the accessibilityfarmer from financial institution. The strategy for developing prime commodity done by depress the displace landfunction, increasethefarmer quality, repair the land quality, use a bit of blood and appropriate kind of the commodity, and alsofind new technology of tool and agriculture engine...|$|E
