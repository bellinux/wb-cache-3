5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for <b>loudspeakers.</b> Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for <b>loudspeakers.</b> The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional <b>loudspeakers</b> on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low frequency content that most conventional <b>loudspeakers</b> are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have <b>loudspeakers</b> at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of <b>loudspeakers</b> {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional <b>loudspeakers</b> and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience.

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque <b>loudspeakers</b> throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>loudspeaker</b> system {{incorporating}} passive diaphragms, {{the term}} 'active driver' {{refers to the}} <b>loudspeaker</b> driver with the voice coil, to distinguish it from the 'passive' diaphragms which have no voice coil. In <b>loudspeaker</b> systems that rely on resonant augmentation of {{the output of the}} active driver (these include bass-reflex systems, passive radiator systems, bandpass systems, and transmission-line systems), the resonant system absorbs the acoustic load from the active <b>loudspeaker</b> driver, decreasing the necessary cone excursion to achieve high output at low frequencies. However, it is advantageous to have a <b>loudspeaker</b> driver with a strong magnetic structure for high electrical damping of the driver cone. This supplies the maximum possible force to the <b>loudspeaker</b> cone and creates the maximum possible excitation of the resonant system.|$|R

5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using <b>loudspeakers</b> {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse.

At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by the {{technical}} aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement <b>loudspeakers.</b> Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E
5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial <b>loudspeakers.</b> Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E
