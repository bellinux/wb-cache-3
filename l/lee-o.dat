40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorragic E. coli (EHEC) {{possess a}} {{pathogenicity}} island (PAI), termed {{the locus of}} enterocyte effacement (LEE), which confers the capability to cause the characteristic attaching and effacing lesions of the brush border. Due to this common property, these organisms are also termed attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC). Sequencing of the EHEC O 157 genome recently revealed {{the presence of other}} putative PAIs in the chromosome of this organism. In this article, we report on the presence of four of those PAIs in a panel of 133 E. coli strains belonging to different pathogroups and serotypes. One of these PAIs, termed O 122 in strain EDL 933 and SpLE 3 in strain Sakai, was observed in most of the AEEC strains examined but not in the other groups of E. coli. It was also found to contain the virulence-associated gene efa 1 /lifA. In EHEC O 157, PAI O 122 is located 0. 7 Mb away from the LEE. Conversely, we demonstrated that in many EHEC non-O 157 strains and EPEC strains belonging to eight serogroups, PAI O 122 and the LEE are physically linked to form a cointegrated structure. This structure can be considered a mosaic PAI that could have been acquired originally by AEEC. In some clones, such as EHEC O 157, the <b>LEE-O</b> 122 mosaic PAI might have undergone recombinational events, resulting in the insertion of the portion referred to as PAI O 122 in a different location...|$|E
