50|$|Despite {{the growth}} {{brought by the}} railroads and new techniques, Missouri {{continued}} to undergo urbanization during the late 19th century. Labor-saving devices such as the sulky plow, <b>corn</b> <b>planter,</b> mower, and reaper made most farm laborers more productive, with a surplus moving to town. In addition, the competition brought by the railroad generally caused a decline in farm prices after 1873; in 1874, a bushel of Missouri corn sold for 67 cents, but its price dropped to 24 cents in 1875 and remained in the 20 to 40 cent range {{for most of the}} 1870s and 1880s. As a result, although the acreage of Missouri farmland had increased from 1870 to 1880, the value of crops produced saw a decline from $103 million to slightly less than $96 million in the same period.|$|R
50|$|Robert's brother Cyrus Avery {{thought the}} {{invention}} had huge potential. To fund their company, Cyrus invested some capital, and Robert sold {{his share of}} the farm to his brother John and borrowed additional money. They began business as R.H. & C.M. Avery Company. Sales did not take off and the brothers' company teetered on bankruptcy. Robert moved his family to Kansas and took advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862 to obtain more farm land. He invented a new spiral corn stalk cutter and this time sales increased quickly. In 1872, Robert moved back to Galesburg and with his brother Cyrus' help, restarted the Avery Company. By 1874 he had a full size working model of his <b>corn</b> <b>planter</b> built. The original planter is now in the Edison Institute Museum at Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|Some tractor {{manufacturers}} produced matching {{equipment that}} could be directly mounted on the tractor. Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, corn pickers and <b>corn</b> <b>planters.</b> In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor. Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semipermanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis. As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time. An implement generally would be mounted {{at the beginning of}} its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed only when the likely use season had ended.|$|R
30|$|Most corn {{insecticides}} {{are applied}} {{in ways that}} expose active ingredients to destructive abiotic and biotic forces that tend {{to break down the}} chemicals to generally less toxic forms. Granular soil insecticides applied via boxes on <b>corn</b> <b>planters</b> tend to break down within weeks as a result of soil microbial activity. Because properly applied granular insecticides are buried in the soil, exposure to non-target organisms is limited, although poorly operated or calibrated planting equipment can result in grains of insecticide remaining on the soil surface, posing a serious potential risk to some bird species. A significant portion of the foliar insecticides applied per hectare for ECB control never hit its plant target, and a portion of the insecticide that does land and lodge on plant tissues is washed off within hours, days, or weeks during rainfall events. This is why insecticide residues are rarely detected in corn grain and silage at harvest time, and why conventional insecticide applications on corn pose little or no human dietary risk.|$|R

Among the five types of drive wheel to rotate the seed metering device, lugged rubber wheel had the lowest level of sliding (21 - 22 %), and produced seed spacing of the closest to the target (19 - 21 cm). The evaluation showed that one drive wheel is not able to drive two units of seed metering device and two units of fertilizer metering device. Rotation of tractor axle can be used effectively to drive the rotor of two units of the fertilizer applicator and corn seed metering devices of two planter units, using the sprocket-chain transmission.

40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary <b>corn</b> <b>planter</b> row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|R

40|$|Modified {{design of}} a planter to be {{attached}} to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this project. This research project {{was part of a}} larger project, called “Developing robotics assisted technology for farming”. The main motivation for this research project is the fact that mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed. Besides, it should require less draft force compared to existing planters so that it can be pulled by the mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To find the forces between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and soil, experiments were designed and performed in the Linear Soil Bin at University of Saskatchewan. Disc and tilt angle of a disc coulter was changed and draft, vertical and side forces applied to it were measured to find the disc and tilt angle combinations that results in minimum draft force. Experiments showed that 7 ° disc angle and 25 ° tilt angle provides the least draft force compared to other disc angle and tilt angle combinations. Then, using the knowledge obtained from literature and the soil bin experiments, a planter was designed conceptually and in detail, based on the existing CNH planter. For further analyses computer modeling was performed. The whole planter was modeled in 3 D, using SolidWorks. Stress analysis was performed in ANSYS Workbench to calculate safety factor of the designed parts. Two prototypes were fabricated and were attached to the mobile robot for field tests. Tests were performed in indoor settings to measure the total draft force required to pull developed planters. Draft force was very close to the value that was calculated in design stage. Results showed that an average of 460 N pulling force is required to pull one row planter for 50 mm depth of cut, which can be compared to n existing CNH <b>corn</b> <b>planter</b> that requires a pulling force of between 900 N to 1300 N. Seed drop accuracy and function of the developed planters in opening and closing a packed soil in presence of residue, were also observed in outdoor tests...|$|R
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, <b>corn</b> <b>planters,</b> cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, corn binders, corn shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R

40|$|Since {{interest}} in winter wheat growing has revived in some sections of Iowa considerable merit has been claimed {{for the press}} drill over other grain drills and other methods of seeding. The Hoosier Press Drill Co., of Richmond, Ind., furnished the Iowa Experiment Station a drill free of charge, and we deemed it of interest to test its value for sowing winter wheat. Accordingly, on October 2, 1893, {{a small piece of}} ground, that had grown a crop of oats and vetches, was plowed to a depth of five inches and disced and harrowed thoroughly, and one-half of the piece sown with Turkish Red winter wheat with the Hoosier press drill, and the remainder with the same variety of wheat, at the same rate per acre, with a common grain drill. The principal point of difference in these machines is that the press drill has runners like a <b>corn</b> <b>planter,</b> that may be forced down to a depth of four or five inches, 2 ̆ 7 and each runner is followed by a narrow wheel that firms the earth over the grain and leaves the soil between the rows standing up in ridges, by reason of which snow falling upon the field during winter lodges first in these tracks and protects the plants. The common drill also leaves the ground ridged, but does not press the soil over the seed, and the ridges are less marked. The soil of both plats was uniform, and all conditions were the same except the method of seeding. The depth of seeding was about four inches on each plat. The crop came on well, both plats coming up about the same time and going through the winter in similar condition. But little if any difference was noticed {{in the early stages of}} growth. Some difference was noticeable through May and June, but it was not until the wheat was in shock that any marked contrast was apparent. Then it was clear that the press drill plat had the heavier crop, though the stand was good on each. Both pieces ripened at the same time, and were harvested July 19 th and handled alike. When threshed the press drill plat, containing 85 square rods, gave 25 bushels and 30 pounds of wheat that tested 61 1 / 2 pounds to the bushel; and the common drill plat of the same area gave 16 bushels that made the same test. The first was at the rate of 48 bushels per acre and the second 30 bushels, a difference of 18 bushels per acre in favor of the press drill. In hauling the grain a mile and a half to the threshing machine one load from the press drill plat fell off and in the extra handling some grain shattered out, but not enough to make any material difference, though whatever it was came from the heavier yield. The test in its details and execution was satisfactorily conducted, and the comparison a fair one so far as could be determined by a single trial, and the result is given as such for what immediate service it may be to those interested; though a comparison of this kind needs to be repeated several times, and under varying conditions, in order to safely establish conclusions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Variation in corn {{seed spacing}} from a John Deere MaxEmerge Plus Vacumeter planter was {{evaluated}} on the University of Nebraska Planter Test Stand {{in a laboratory}} setting for two seed tube conditions (new or worn) with two examples of corn seed shape (round or flat). Seed spacing uniformity was measured using three seed spacing uniformity parameters: Coefficient of Precision (CP 3), ISO Multiples index, and ISO Miss index. Differences were detected in all three seed spacing uniformity parameters due to the seed tube condition. The new seed tubes had better seed spacing uniformity than the worn seed tubes, within each example of the seed shapes (round or flat) used in this experiment. For the seed used in this experiment, the round corn seed had better seed spacing uniformity than the flat corn seed, {{within each of the}} seed tube conditions (new or worn). A recommended schedule for seed tube replacement to maintain seed spacing uniformity has not been developed, and more research in this area is needed. Currently, sugarbeet growers in western Nebraska use one of three options: a) test one of their seed tubes on a good planter test stand every year before sugarbeet planting season and replace all tubes when results indicate it will improve seed spacing uniformity to the desired level; b) feel the inside front surface of the seed tube every year before sugarbeet planting season and change seed tubes when the feel of the surface changes from a slick plastic to a very fine sandpaper; or c) replace seed tubes before sugarbeet planting season when they have planted over approximately 150 acres of <b>corn</b> per <b>planter</b> row with their current seed tubes...|$|R
5000|$|Canton, {{with its}} {{somewhat}} higher ground but still close river proximity experienced rapid {{growth over the}} next nine years after Tully's demise and by 1860 had a population of over 2,000 people. The town was officially incorporated on January 28, 1851. Ferry service across the Mississippi River dates {{back as far as}} 1844 in the Canton area, the first being at Tully. On February 24, 1853 a charter was granted for the [...] "Lewis-Adams" [...] river ferry. The early ferries were paddlewheel craft with the power supplied by horses on treadmills. Local travelers and those heading westward in pursuit of a new life meant heavy use of the ferry, with early fares being 50 cents per wagon and 10 cents for travelers on foot. In an era where railroads were still few Canton, along with Alexandria, Missouri several miles upriver to the north, became major trading and shipping points for towns and counties on the northeast Missouri interior. A stage line ran from Canton as far west as Kirksville, some eighty miles away in Adair county, prior to the American Civil War. Another key event in Canton's history came about in 1853 with the founding of [...] "Christian University", now known as Culver-Stockton College. Closed {{for a period of time}} during the Civil War, the college reopened in 1865 and has been a foundation of the community since. Henderson Hall, a.k.a. [...] "Old Main", on the Culver-Stockton campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a strategic river port, Canton was involved considerably in the Civil War. Loyalties were heavily mixed and both the Union and Confederate armies recruited heavily in the town and surrounding area. Federal troops occupied Canton in July, 1861 to quell recent unrest and quash recruiting for the Missouri State Guard and pro-Confederate guerrillas by Lewis county residents Martin E. Green, Joseph C. Porter and others. On August 2, 1862 Colonel Porter ordered a raid on Canton. One resident was killed and another, a Union sympathizer, kidnapped by the bushwhackers, who also stole large quantities of weapons, medicine and other supplies. Canton continued its role as gateway to northeast Missouri agricultural after the war, with several industries catering to those needs. Pork processing had begun in the 1840s, with thousands of hogs being slaughtered by the late 1870s. Iron plows, wagons, a patented hand <b>corn</b> <b>planter,</b> and buttons—using mussel shells from the nearby river—were some of the diverse items manufactured in Canton in the 19th century. Limited rail service had existed in Canton in antebellum times but the tracks were destroyed during Civil War fighting. Rail service was finally restored to the town in 1871 with the arrival of the St. Louis, Keokuk & Northwestern Railroad. While the Mississippi river has been the lifeblood of the town, it has also been Canton's nemesis throughout the years. Major flooding has occurred many times in the town's history. Some of the more notable, in addition to the aforementioned 1851 flood, were in 1929, 1973, 1993 and 2008. The 1929 flood was caused by a levee break. Within an hour of the break two square miles of the town and surrounding countryside were underwater, including more than 200 homes and the Canton school building but no lives were lost. During the New Deal era, Jessie Hull Mayer won the federal commission to complete a murals in the Canton post office. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Mayer's mural, Winter Landscape was installed in 1940 and was restored in 1971, with additional restoration work performed in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Seed {{placement}} {{and failure to}} establish a uniform plant stand are critical problems associated with production of corn (Zea mays) following wheat (Triticum aestivum) in a conservation agriculture system in Iran. Our objectives were to evaluate {{the performance of a}} <b>corn</b> row- crop <b>planter</b> equipped with two planter attachments (smooth/toothed coulters) at six wheat residue management systems (three tillage systems and two levels of surface residue) at two forward speeds of 5 and 7 km h- 1. Residue retained after planting, seeding depth, emergence rate index (ERI) and seed spacing indices were determined. The baled residue plots tilled by chisel plow followed by disc harrow (BRCD) resulted in minimum residue after planting as compared to other residue treatments. Furthermore, the maximum values of the ERI and uniformity of plant spacing pertained to this treatment. Other results showed that the ERI increased up to 18 % for the toothed coulter as compared to the smooth coulter. The toothed coulter also established a deeper seed placement as compared to the smooth coulter. Planting at forward speed of 5 km h- 1 resulted in deeper seeding depth as compared to a forward speed of 7 km h- 1. However, lower values of miss and precision indices were obtained at forward speed of 7 km h- 1, indicating a more uniformity of plant spacing. Results of this study showed that equipping the conventional planter with toothed coulter and planting in soil prepared under the BRCD residue management system can result in a satisfactory conservation crop production system...|$|R
