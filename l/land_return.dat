40|$|Farm budget {{analysis}} {{is a tool}} for understanding the economic performance of agricultural practices- {{to assess the impact}} of technology interventions, price and policy changes. This helps provide better com-prehension of the strengths and weaknesses of various farm operations. As a type of farm budget analy-sis, the farming system modelling software Olympe developed by a consortium of L’Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD) and Institut Agronomique Méditerranéen de Montpellier (IAMM), is an efficient piece of software for analysing and modelling farming systems performance. Olympe gives a comprehensive overview of farmers ’ situations and links to technical innovations and practices. A range of analyses can be carried out including economic impact of technical choices, effects of climatic or economic uncertainties, and the environmental impacts of land use options. The Olympe applica-tion was used to analyse the impact of new Rubber Agroforestry Systems (RAS technology) in Sanggau, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. RAS technologies are developed for adoption by smallholder farmers with limited resources. The results show that while the RAS technology requires more capital input, both labour return and <b>land</b> <b>return</b> are higher than in farmers ’ traditional systems. The labour return of RAS technologies can be higher than that of intensive monoculture rubber. The economic and environmental advantages of diversified RAS technologies over monoculture rubber and oil palm are evident...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} real options {{framework}} {{to evaluate the}} cost-effectiveness of four types of subsidies that aim to encourage a socially desirable land use under return uncertainties and costly reversibility of land use change. We first present a land conversion model {{to show how the}} subsidies that are expected net present value (ENPV) equivalent can change a representative farmer’s optimal land conversion rules differently for converting land into an alternative use as well as converting out of it. This is because these subsidies affect the land conversion costs, <b>land</b> <b>return</b> level and uncertainty differently. Then in the context of encouraging energy crop production, we compare the probabilities of inducing the representative farmer to convert land from a current crop to an energy crop across four subsidies for the same, fixed 30 -year expected government budget. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show that the insurance subsidy results in the highest probability of land being converted to the energy crop, followed by the constant subsidy. Although the cost-sharing subsidy and the variable subsidy encourage land conversion to the energy crop, they also reduce the incentive to retain land in it. Over time, these two subsidies have little effect on the probability of land converting into energy crops compared to the no-subsidy baseline. Combining the establishment cost-sharing subsidy with other annual subsidies has no added effect over single subsidies in inducing land conversion to the energy crop.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Poyang Lake, located in Jiangxi Province, China, is a large freshwater lake (~ 4000 km 2) connected to the Yangtze River. Flooding hazards in Poyang Lake regions have become more severe in recent years. To reduce flood potential downstream, including Poyang Lake, and also to generate hydroelectric power and to improve navigation, Three Gorges Dam is being built in the upper Yangtze River. In this study, I systematically explore issues related to flood potential in Poyang Lake regions, including evolution and distribution of land use change, distribution of potential flood regions, and effects of Three Gorges Dam, through two approaches. First, I summarize background information of geography and historical floods of Poyang Lake, and review previous researches related with flooding in Poyang Lake. Second, I use satellite imagery (remote sensing) to explore the spatial distribution of flood potential and land cover changes in the Poyang Lake region. Historical land reclamation has largely shrunk the Poyang Lake water surface since 1950, especially in the recent 30 years. In the period between 1989 and 2003, Poyang Lake experienced both new land reclamation (43 km 2) and <b>land</b> <b>return.</b> However, the water surface in small satellite lakes has largely shrunk over the same time period (~ 700 km 2), which may significantly impact the ecosystem in the Poyang Lake region...|$|E
40|$|The {{land reform}} process in Zimbabwe has raised {{critical}} questions about land {{with regard to}} ownership and access, productivity of land and the most suitable size of land (small scale or large scale). Over {{a decade after the}} most recent phase of land reform in Zimbabwe, critical questions about land are continually debated in an ever-growing literature on land. These questions span a wide margin, from ownership, access, and productivity to who exactly should benefit from land reform processes. One important debate has centred {{on the question of whether}} the primary consideration of land reform processes should be aimed at addressing the more ideational aspects of <b>land</b> (<b>return</b> to ancestral land, land as central to personal identities and the subsequent political and social processes of determining who belongs and who is a stranger) or material concerns (relating to questions of food security, livelihood making and the concerns with environmental change). Subsequently, literature dealing with land is often organised around a particular theme such as identity, tenure, politics, political economy, livelihoods and questions relating to environmental change. Using the case of small scale commercial farming families of Mushawasha in Masvingo Zimbabwe who came to own the land as purchase area farmers as a result of the 1930 Land Apportionment Act, this thesis constitutes an attempt to integrate multiple approaches to the question of land, using a critical realist framework. I argue that the link between people and land, which is explored generationally and in the context of broader economic, political, historical and social change in Zimbabwe, is ever changing and is influenced by a number of factors. For that reason, viewing the question of land in a reductionist fashion from either an ideational or a material paradigm is unsatisfactory. What this research reveals is that the links between people and land are tempered numerous factors including generation, gender and residential status.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to verify, through sampling, is the service technical standard adopted at the biggest rural electrification program, introduced {{in the state of}} ParanÃ from 1983 to 1991 in the concession area of Energy Company from ParanÃ â COPEL, named CLIC RURAL, supplies the electric power needs of the electrified rural properties and if the electric energy introducing was able to contribute to the increase of the family income. The work was based on a field research with a questionnaire application to the farmers and the inspection of the existing technical standard. The results show the rural electrification benefits in some aspects. Social aspect: improvement on the schooling grade of the farmers and the population in a general way, the increase of the average monthly consumption per capita, significant increase on the purchasing of electrical house devices, pumping and rural equipments with the generation of direct and indirect taxes. Economical benefits are identified with the increase of electrical energy consumption by property and acquisition of electrical rural equipments and electrical rural devices. The environmental benefits can be seen through the abandon of fuels derived from oil and the existence of an environmental protection area. As a negative point, the reduction in 31 % in the number of inhabitants by occupied property. According to an opinion research, 76, 4 % are satisfied with the power standard made available at the program introducing period. From it, 4, 5 % made power load increase. Yet, only 37 % of the rural consumers got to increase or generate income with the electrification of their properties. It can also be noticed that the main statal concessionaire has gradually abandoned the materials used in the rural electrification standard named low cost; however it continues using the monophasis system with <b>land</b> <b>return</b> (MRT). The 70 Amps biphasis standard would be the most adequate for the researched region. But, the 50 Amps biphasis standard would be the condition minimum necessary for income generation in the property. These results aim to contribute with the public politics devisers for the universalization of the electrical power service of the consumers still in the dark spread at the rural zones. O objetivo principal deste trabalho foi verificar por meio de amostragem se o padrÃo tÃcnico de atendimento adotado no maior programa de eletrificaÃÃo rural, implantado no estado do ParanÃ no perÃodo de 1983 a 1991, na Ãrea de concessÃo da Companhia Paranaense de Energia â COPEL, denominado CLIC RURAL, supre as necessidades energÃticas das propriedades rurais eletrificadas e se a implantaÃÃo da energia elÃtrica foi capaz de contribuir para o aumento de renda da famÃlia. O trabalho foi fundamentado em pesquisa de campo com a aplicaÃÃo de um questionÃrio aos proprietÃrios rurais e da inspeÃÃo do padrÃo tÃcnico existente. Os resultados comprovam os benefÃcios da eletrificaÃÃo rural sob alguns aspectos. Aspecto social: melhoria no grau de escolaridade dos responsÃveis pelas propriedades e da populaÃÃo de uma maneira geral; aumento no consumo mÃdio mensal de energia elÃtrica per capita, aumento substancial na posse de eletrodomÃsticos e equipamentos para bombeamento e eletrorurais com a geraÃÃo de impostos direta ou indiretamente. Os benefÃcios econÃmicos sÃo comprovados pelo aumento do consumo de energia elÃtrica por propriedade e pela aquisiÃÃo de equipamentos eletrorurais e eletrodomÃsticos. Os benefÃcios para meio ambiente verificam-se pelo abandono de combustÃveis derivados do petrÃleo e pela existÃncia de Ãrea de proteÃÃo ambiental. Como ponto negativo, a reduÃÃo em 31 % no nÃmero de habitantes por propriedade ocupada. Segundo pesquisa de opiniÃo, 76, 4 % estÃo satisfeitos com o padrÃo da entrada de serviÃo disponibilizado na Ãpoca da implementaÃÃo do programa. Desses, 4, 5 % fizeram aumento de carga. Ainda, somente 37 % dos consumidores rurais conseguiram aumentar ou gerar renda com a eletrificaÃÃo de suas propriedades. Constata-se tambÃm que a principal concessionÃria do estado abandonou gradativamente os materiais utilizados no padrÃo de eletrificaÃÃo rural denominado de baixo custo, porÃm continua a utilizar o sistema monofÃsico com retorno por terra (MRT). O padrÃo bifÃsico de 70 AmpÃres para a entrada de serviÃo seria o mais adequado para a regiÃo da pesquisa. PorÃm, a entrada de serviÃo com padrÃo bifÃsico de 50 AmpÃres seria a condiÃÃo mÃnima necessÃria para geraÃÃo de renda nas propriedades. Esses resultados visam contribuir com os idealizadores de polÃticas pÃblicas para a universalizaÃÃo do atendimento com energia elÃtrica dos consumidores ainda no escuro espalhados pelo campo...|$|E
