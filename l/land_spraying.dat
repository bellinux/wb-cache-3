(The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and <b>landing</b> gear <b>spray</b> guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips).

40|$|The aerosol in {{the coastal}} {{environment}} consists of a complicated mixture of anthropogenic and rural aerosol generated over <b>land,</b> and sea <b>spray</b> aerosol. Also, particles are generate dover sea by physical and chemical processes and the chemical composition may change due to condensation/evaporation of gaseous materials. The actual composition {{is a function of}} air mass history and fetch. At the land-sea transition the continental sources cease to exist, and thus the concentrations of land-based particles and gases will gradually decrease. At the same time, sea spray is generated due to the interaction between wind and waves in a developing wave field. A very intense source for sea spray aerosol is the surf zone. Consequently, the aerosol transported over sea in off-shore winds will abruptly charge at the land-sea transition and then gradually loose its continental character, while also the contribution of the surf-generated aerosol will decrease. The latter will be compensated, at least in part, by the production of sea spray aerosol. A Coastal Aerosol Transport model is being developed describing the evolution of the aerosol size distribution in an air column advected from the coast line over sea in off-shore winds. Both removal and production are taken into account. The result are applied to estimate the effect of the changing size distribution on the extinction coefficients. In this contribution, preliminary results are presented from a study {{of the effects of the}} surf-generated aerosol and the surface production...|$|R
40|$|Agronomics is a {{profession}} of many related sequential and sometimes concurrent tedious processes and methodologies. The Primary process among many is the spraying of insecticides, pesticides, liquefied fertilizers {{in the agricultural}} farmlands. The typical rice growing <b>land</b> requires extensive <b>spraying</b> during its growing stages. The manual methods to spray the insecticides or fertilizers are: a person fixing a sprayer to a container and manually actuating a lever to generate pressure and pumping the contents through a tube or a mobile vehicle carrying an inbuilt compressor and sprayer unit which has to be manually driven by a human operator. These conventional methods are more fuel consuming and are also susceptible to human errors causing more uneven spraying and causes large wastage of the costly insecticides.. Another big drawback in human operated systems is that the operator is more exposed to the harmful ingredients of the toxic insecticides during spraying. Long term exposure in the entire season will extremely harm the operator and {{as well as the}} surrounding people and animal’s health as bullocks are the laboring animals in the farmlands at larger areas of farmlands in south-Asia even now.

Forest habitat destruction and wholesale hunting brought the passenger pigeon to extinction. The eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), a shorebird who was also seen historically in great numbers met a similar extinction due to changing habitats and diminishing numbers from hunting.Associated with the irradication program of the prairie dog (gopher) in the 1930s was the dramatic decline in population of the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) which relied on the prairie dog as its main source of food. The lowered population was hastened as the natural habitat of the ferret was also being taken over by agricultural machinery and practices.|$|R

40|$|Treatment and {{disposal}} of domestic sludge have been problematic due {{to the presence of}} heavy metals. One of an efficient method is the application of the sludge to an agriculture land. Several factors that attributed to the feasibility of this method include the nutrient content of domestic sludge necessary for plant growth, low handling costs and promotion of recycling. The objectives of the research are to determine the heavy metals content in domestic sludge and the effect of the sludge application to agricultural land.

40|$|As the world’s rural populations {{continue}} to migrate from farmland to sprawling cities, transport networks form an impenetrable maze within which monocultures of urban form erupt from the spaces in‐between. These urban monocultures are as problematic to human activity in cities as cropping monocultures are to ecosystems in regional landscapes. In China, {{the speed of}} urbanisation is exacerbating the production of mono‐functional private and public spaces. Edges are tightly controlled. Barriers and management practices at these boundaries are discouraging the formation of new synergistic relationships, critical in the long‐term stability of ecosystems that host urban habitats. Some urban planners, engineers, urban designers, architects and landscape architects have recognised these shortcomings in contemporary Chinese cities. The ideology of sustainability, while critically debated, is bringing together thinking people in these and other professions {{under the umbrella of}} an ecological ethic. This essay aims to apply landscape ecology theory, a conceptual framework used by many professionals involved in land development processes, to a concept being developed by BAU International called Networks Cities: a city with its various land uses arranged in nets of continuity, adjacency, and superposition. It will consider six lesser‐known concepts in relation to creating enhanced human activity along (un) structured edges between proposed nets and suggest new frontiers that might be challenged in an eco‐city. Ecological theory suggests that sustaining biodiversity in regions and landscapes depends on habitat distribution patterns. Flora and fauna biologists have long studied edge habitats and have been confounded by the paradox that maximising the breadth of edges is detrimental to specialist species but favourable to generalist species. Generalist species of plants and animals tolerate frequent change in the landscape, frequenting two or more habitats for their survival. Specialist species are less tolerant of change, having specific habitat requirements during their life cycle. Protecting species richness then may be at odds with increasing mixed habitats or mixed‐use zones that are dynamic places where diverse activities occur. Forman (1995) in his book Land Mosaics however argues that these two objectives of land use management are entirely compatible. He postulates that an edge may be comprised of many small patches, corridors or convoluting boundaries of large patches. Many ecocentrists now consider humans to be just another species inhabiting the ecological environments of our cities. Hence habitat distribution theory may be useful in planning and designing better human habitats in a rapidly urbanising context like China. In less‐constructed environments, boundaries and edges provide important opportunities for the movement of multi‐habitat species into, along and from adjacent land use areas. For instance, invasive plants may escape into a national park from domestic gardens while wildlife may forage on garden plants in adjoining residential areas. It is at these interfaces that human interactions too flow backward and forward between <b>land</b> types. <b>Spray</b> applications of substances by farmers on cropland may disturb neighbouring homeowners while suburban residents may help themselves to farm produce on neighbouring orchards. Edge environments {{are some of the most}} dynamic and contested spaces in the landscape. Since most of us require access to at least two or three habitats diurnally, weekly, monthly or seasonally, their proximity to each other becomes critical in our attempts to improve the sustainability of our cities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{many parts}} of Africa as in Benin, the main {{strategies}} of vector control {{are based on the}} scaling-up of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The need to understand the biological implications of IRS in large scale and full coverage of LLITNs is paramount. It is in this context that the present study was conducted. It aims to evaluate the effect of a large scale IRS using a non-pyrethroid insecticide and full coverage of deltamethrin treated nets on the behavior of An. gambiae s. l. in the intervention areas compared to untreated areas used as controls. Methods Mosquitoes were collected using human <b>landing</b> catches, pyrethrum <b>spray</b> catches and window exit traps to assess reduction of entry rate, endophily rate, endophagy rate and overall mortality rate in natural populations of An. gambiae s. l. before IRS and LLITNs intervention (2007) and after in 2008 and 2010. Results In the IRS arm, endophily rate was 67. 13 % before intervention and 4. 5 % after intervention, whereas in the control arm it was stable at 51. 67 % (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). In the LLITN arm endophily rates also decreased after intervention. After the IRS, no gravid mosquitoes were collected from all treated localities, but LLITN performance was not that spectacular. The proportion of mosquitoes biting indoors in the IRS arm decreased from 67. 09 % before intervention to 42. 85 % after intervention, compared to a low but significant decrease (71. 31 % to 57. 46 %) in the LLITN arm. The use of vector control tools and behavior of the host would be the main factors that modify the behavior of taking a human blood meal observed on An. gambiae s. l. inside human dwellings. Conclusion The impact on the behavior of An. gambiae s. l. observed with the bendiocarb used in IRS was highly effective compared with the free distribution of LLITNs in terms of mortality and the decrease of proportions of indoor feeding. Despite this efficacy, {{there is a need for}} complementary tools and research of alternative strategy oriented on effective health education, and the use of powerful tools such as IRS, LLITNs, larviciding and repellents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1960 More than {{one-fourth of}} the forest land in the Pacific Northwest is growing timber at reduced {{capacity}} {{as the result of}} brush encroachment. Increasing use of chemicals in brush control requires that more information be available regarding their use. Bigleaf maple, Oregon oak and vine maple are among the more noxious brush species in the Willamette Valley area. This thesis summarizes the progress which has been made in the control of these species by the Forest Research Division. Aerial sprays have been found satisfactory in many areas for broadcast spraying of low brush cover. Basal sprays and ground level foliage sprays are used on weed trees and tall brush. Topography is also a major consideration in choice of method. Effectiveness of the herbicide is determined by climate, season, species, specific chemical, formulation, diluent, concentration, and many unknown factors. Most of the treatments in this project were applied to individual stems. Many of the tests were established in order to find the most effective chemical for a given situation; others expand on information gained in earlier trials. On large trees, applications were made both basally and in frills; also in bands around the boles at breast height with paste type herbicides. Smaller shrubs were treated with foliage sprays, dormant cane sprays, and individual stem sprays. The treatments were located on Bureau of Land Management land near Scio, Oregon, and in the McDonald Forest. Aerial spray projects conducted by the Bureau of Land Management in the Cascades and in the Coast Range have been included in these observations. Bigleaf maple was killed very successfully with basal sprays of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in oil in a mixture of 32 ahg. It is very likely that much lower dosages will prove adequate. Maple stems up to eight inches d. b. h. were well controlled with 2, 4, 5 -T applied in a similar manner. Girdling has not proved to be an adequate method of control because of basal resprouting and delayed top-kill. Frilling followed with a dilute spray (22 ahg) of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in kerosene gave good control. However, the cost of application is higher than for a similar basal spray. Paste herbicides were largely rather ineffective except for kilbrush applied in September. Oregon oak has proven more difficult to kill with basal sprays than maple. However, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and 2, 4 -D amine in frills have both provided complete top killing. 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) gave the better sprout control. Kilbrush gave good results on small stems when applied in August. Scarification of the bark prior to treatment proved to be the most dependable method. Vine maple has been top-killed by 2, 4, 5 -T, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and brushkiller mixtures in many forms and concentrations. Sprouting has not been controlled completely by any of these but 2, 4, 5 -T is the most effective in this respect. Aerial sprays of four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T in some cases have caused nearly complete top-kill, and considerable sprout retardation. Snowbrush has been completely killed by 2, 4, 5 -T with foliage and with step sprays. A Bureau of <b>Land</b> Management aerial <b>spray</b> project using four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T gave 100 per cent kill of this species. Cherry, elderberry, thimbleberry, poison oak and madrone can be effectively top-killed with 2, 4, 5 -T as basal or foliage spray. Sprout control has been relatively poor on most of these species. Grass competition to young seedlings can be reduced with several chemicals. Tree survival is consistently higher, however, when the minimum amount of grass herbicide is applied which will reduce grass density to approximately 60 per cent of normal. Soil sterilization reduces tree survival. The use of herbicides as a forest management tool has increased rapidly in recent years. Public acceptance of the value of this tool and further refinements in techniques can provide much needed relief for the brush problem in out forests...|$|R
