In addition pre-exposure of normal peritoneal macrophages to an acute pleural inflammatory exudate before supernatant production enhanced the release of <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factors</b> found both in the unfractionated supernatant and a sub- 5 -kd ultrafiltrate. Thus these results demonstrate that an acute inflammatory reaction, initiated by a non-antigenic stimulus is able to stimulate macrophages remote from the inflammatory site to produce a factor which behaves like IL-I in a standard IL-I assay. The presence of low-molecular-weight factors (less than 5 kd) with similar activity may suggest that degradation of IL-I has taken place to yield active fragments.

40|$|International audienceInorganic arsenic, a {{carcinogenic}} environmental contaminant, exerts immunosuppressive {{effects on}} human T lymphocytes. In particular, interleukin- 2 (IL 2) secretion and T cell proliferation are reduced when {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from individuals chronically exposed to arsenic are stimulated ex vivo with lectins such as phytohemaglutinin (PHA). However, {{it is not}} clear whether the metalloid directly acts on T cells or blocks monocyte-dependent accessory signals activated by PHA. We report that in vitro pre-treatment of PBMC with sodium arsenite (NaAs) reduces IL 2 secretion and T cell proliferation induced by PHA, but does not prevent expression of monocyte-derived cytokines (IL 1, IL 6, TNFα) functioning as <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, we found that NaAs delays induction of IL 2 and IL 2 receptor α chain (IL 2 RA) mRNA levels in human primary isolated T cells activated by PHA. Kinetic analysis showed that NaAs pre-treatment first inhibits, but thereafter markedly increases, induction of IL 2 and IL 2 RA mRNA when T cells are stimulated with PHA for 8 h and 72 h, respectively. We conducted whole genome microarray-based analysis of gene expression in primary T cell cultures derived from independent donors. NaAs systematically and significantly up-regulated a set of 35 genes, including several immune and stress genes, such as IL 13, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, lymphotoxin α and heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). Up-regulation of HO- 1, a stress and immunosuppressive protein, was rapidly detectable, both in T cells and in PBMC treated with NaAs. Inhibition of the immunosuppressive activity of HO- 1 in PBMC however failed to prevent NaAs-dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation induced by PHA. Our findings demonstrate that, at least in vitro, inorganic arsenic acts directly on human T cells and impairs their activity, probably independently of HO- 1 expression and monocyte-related accessory signals...|$|R

A dose-related response to MDP or N-acetylmuramyl-L-alpha-aminobutyryl-D-isoglutamine [(Abu 1]-MDP) was observed. However, we found several adjuvant-active analogs which were completely innocuous in guinea pigs. 2 -(2 -Acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose- 3 -O-yl) -D-hexanoyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutam ine (3 '-n-propyl-MDP) was one such compound. To understand the differences between the toxic and nontoxic compounds, macrophage stimulation in vitro was studied. Both compounds stimulated guinea pig peritoneal macrophages to produce <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> in vitro. However, the supernatant from 3 '-n-propyl-MDP-stimulated macrophages had no observable effects on guinea pigs, whereas the dialyzed supernatant from [Abu 1]-MDP-stimulated cells readily induced the guinea pig distress syndrome.

LPS from most gram-negative bacteria have appeared to have similar biologic activities regardless of the species of origin or method of preparation of the LPS. More recent studies have suggested differences in the effects of protein-rich as opposed to protein-free LPS in inducing mitogenesis of lymphocytes from endotoxin-resistant C 3 H/HeJ mice. These studies examine other activities of endotoxin-associated protein (EAP), purified to less than 0. 007 % contamination with LPS, and demonstrate that this material has activity mimicking some {{of the effects of}} interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). EAP proved to be as potent as LPS in eliciting rises in concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) and was active in both endotoxin-sensitive (CF 1) and endotoxin-resistant (C 3 H/HeJ) mice. In contrast to LPS, which mediates its SAA-inducing activity by release of an inducer (IL- 1) from LPS-stimulated macrophages, EAP appeared to act directly to induce SAA production, in that incubation with macrophages failed to increase its activity. EAP also exhibited IL- 1 -like activity in the <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> assay when both CF 1 and C 3 H/HeJ thymocytes and macrophages were tested. The <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity of EAP was not blocked by addition of polymyxin B.

In general, this set of activities would seem to be consistent with the notion that ILl acts as a soluble mediator during inflammatory responses. We have recently purified to homogeneity a polypeptide secreted by human monocytes that produces several IL-l-like effects (10). The initial step in the action of IL- 1 is most likely the binding of this hormone to plasma membrane receptors. The availability of purified IL- 1 in our laboratory rendered a search for such receptors possible. For the initial characterization of the plasma membrane (IL- 1) receptors, we chose the murine T lymphoma LBRM- 33 - 1 A 5 as a model cell.

The adjuvanticity of MDP in the primary antibody response has been attributed to stimulation of either T or B lymphocytes, or both, or to stimulation of macrophages, resulting in increased antigen processing or increased lymphocyte stimulation by monokines (3). When added to cultured cells in vitro, MDP also stimulates a variety of macrophage functions that are not necessarily related to the response to specific antigens, namely, inhibition of macrophage migration (4), release of endogenous pyrogen (5), production of <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> (6), enhanced production of collagenase and prostaglandins (7), increased uptake of glucosamine (8), inhibition of growth of mastocytoma cells (9), and augmented direct cytolytic activity against tumor target cells (10).

The en-hancement of the reaction {{may be due to}} the increased production of a T-lymphocyte-derived macrophage chemotactic factor (LDMCF) because treatment of animals with CFA potentiates antigen- and concanavalin A(ConA) -induced release of LDMCF activity from spleen cells of the CFA-treated animals in vitro. This potentiating effect by CFA seems to be ascribed to the release of an adherent-cell-derived soluble factor from the CFA-treated animals. The adherent cell-derived factor, LDMCF-potentiating factor (LDMCF-PF), pref-erentially potentiates the release of LDMCF activity but not of eosinophil chemotactic activity from antigen- or Con-A-stimulated T lymphocytes. Protein synthesis is required for release of LDMCF-PF. Molecular weight of LDMCF-PF activity is assumed to be about 10, 000 - 20, 000. LDMCF-PF activity is sensitive to trypsin, to neuraminidase, and also to alkalinity at pH 11, suggesting that LDMCF-PF is a glycoprotein.

They had different Mr upon gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. In contrast to IL- 1 beta, HGF showed heterogeneity on a cation-exchange column. IL- 1 beta and HGF were purified to homogeneity by a sequence of four and five purification steps, respectively. Leukocyte-derived HGF was characterized by analysis of its NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence. This revealed complete homology with fibroblast-derived HGF, 26 -kDa protein, IFN-beta 2, and B cell stimulatory factor 2, molecules which have collectively been designated as IL- 6. IL- 1 beta exerted an antiviral and growth-promoting effect of fibroblasts, whereas HGF/IL- 6 did not. Both IL- 1 and IL- 6 possessed <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity, which could be neutralized only by an anti-serum against the corresponding cytokine. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|IL- 1 is an {{important}} growth regulatory molecule secreted by stimulated macrophages (1) {{and a variety of}} other cell types (reviewed by Duff, reference 2). Molecular cloning ofthe sequences encoding IL- 1 has revealed the existence of two distinct but related species of IL- 1, designated IL- 1 a and IL- 1 R, which act through a common receptor (3) and appear to have very similar if not identical biologic activities (4). IL- 1 was first identified as a <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor,</b> but more recently has been found to possess many different activities with a wide variety of cell types. IL- 1 acts as a cofactor for Con A activation of restingT cells (5); as an inducer ofIL- 2 production by T cell lines (6); as a growth and differentiation factor for B cells (7); and as a primary mediator of the inflammatory response (8, 9). The importance of IL- 1 in the regulation of hemopoiesis has only recently been widely recognized. Many different investigators have shown that IL- 1 induces the production of several different hemopoietic growth factors, including both granulocyte/macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) ' and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) by a variety of cell types including lung fibroblasts (10), human mononuclear phagocytes (11), an...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{stimulation}} of mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood with mitogens causes {{the release of}} factors (monokines and lymphokines) which possess distinct biological activities. One such factor, termed 22 K, can induce production of human beta-interferon (HuIFN-beta) in cultured human fibroblasts, thereby rendering these cells resistant to virus infection. Here we report the complete purification and partial sequencing (39 N-terminal amino acids) of this factor, whose relative molecular mass was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 17, 000 (17 K). In addition to an antiviral effect, the pure protein exhibits several other biological activities. Most significantly, intravenous (i. v.) injection of the factor in rabbits caused fever and granulopenia at doses of 0. 1 - 1 microgram per kg, effects which we attribute to a monokine called endogenous pyrogen (EP). In vitro, the protein was scored as positive in a LAF (<b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor)</b> assay at 0. 1 - 1 ng ml- 1. LAF and EP {{are considered to be}} members of one family of monokines, called interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). For this reason, and also because the amino-acid sequence of the 22 K factor is at least partially homologous to a complementary DNA-derived IL- 1 sequence, we postulate that the 22 K factor also belongs to the IL- 1 family. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While IL- 1 was {{initially}} {{described as a}} <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> (1), subsequent studies (2, 3) have shown that IL- 1 regulates a variety of nonlymphoid cells involved in the inflammatory response. Prominent among these are connective tissue cells. While early studies demonstrated the ability of IL-I to stimulate proliferation by human dermal fibroblasts (4 - 6) and collagenase production by human synovial fibroblasts (7 - 9), more {{recent studies have shown}} matrix resorptive effects on articular cartilage (10) and bone (11 - 13) in organ culture. When one fractionates human monocyte culture supernatants by IEF, three major charged species having pI of 6. 8, 5. 4, and 5. 2 are consistently observed whether the fractions are assayed on murine thymocytes or connective tissue cells (4, 5, 14). The pI 6. 8 species, which is responsible for- 90 % of the biological activity found in human monocyte culture supernatants, has been purified (15, 16), and amino acid sequence analysis (16, 17) shows that it is encoded by an abundant mRNA, the cDNA of which is now referred to as IL- 1,Q (17, 18). The pl 5. 2 and pl 5. 4 species have recently also been purified (19) and amino aci...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage {{function}} in neonates was dissected into four components: antigen uptake and catabolism, cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, {{and the production}} of the lymphostimulatory molecule interleukin- 1 (also called thymocyte mitogenic protein or <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor).</b> The uptake and catabolism of 125 I-labeled Listeria monocytogenes was equivalent in macrophages from adult and neonatal mice. However, interactions between macrophages from neonates, heat-killed Listeria organisms, and immune T lymphocytes were impaired, and no cytocidal macrophages capable of killing tumor cells were generated. Previous studies with cells from adult mice had established that the development of cytocidal macrophages required Ia-bearing, antigen-presenting macrophages and histocompatibility at I-A between macrophages and T cells. To circumvent this requirement for antigen-presenting macrophages, an assay was used in which lymphokine was added directly to the macrophages from neonates. Strong cytocidal activity resulted. Thus, our studies confirmed that macrophages from neonates present antigen poorly but can acquire cytocidal function provided that the need for antigen-presenting function is bypassed. Similar conclusions were reached for the secretion of interleukin- 1. Macrophages from neonates spontaneously secreted as much mediator as macrophages from adults, and the secretion was increased after the ingestion of heat-killed Listeria organisms or endotoxin. However, the marked increase in interleukin- 1 production that follows antigen-macrophage-lymphocyte interaction was best seen in macrophages from adults. Macrophages from neonates could be activated to ingest C 3 b-coated sheep erythrocytes...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) 1 is {{a protein}} factor {{secreted}} by macrophages that exerts {{a wide range}} of effects on cells of the immune system as well as a variety of other cell types (1 - 3), Recently, a number of biological responses have been attributed to factors that copurify with IL- 1 and are thought likely to also be mediated by IL- 1. Thus, it is probable that IL- 1 mediates the activities previously referred to as <b>lymphocyte-activating</b> <b>factor</b> (4), endogenous or leukocytic pyrogen (5), B cell-activating factor (6), epidermal cell thymocyte-activating factor (7), leukocyte endogenous mediator (8), a bone resorption factor active in rheumatoid arthritis (9, 10), {{and a variety of other}} activities. Recent studies of human and murine IL- 1 have characterized the partially purified molecule as having a molecular weight in the 11, 000 - 16, 000 range, and a pI of 4. 5 - 5. 5 for mouse (11), and ~ 6. 8 - 7. 2 for human IL- 1 (12). We have been investigating simplified procedures for production and purification of IL- 1 from human macrophages in order to produce quantities of protein sufficient for structural and biological characterization of the molecule. Previously described methods for production and purification of IL- 1 have generally suffered from low overall yields of IL- 1 activity and insufficient purity of the final product. Our method takes advantage of mild, high yield procedures at every step, to obtain exellent recovery of active, homogeneous IL- 1...|$|E
