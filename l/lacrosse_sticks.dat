25|$|Many {{other types}} of sports and {{recreation}} equipment, such as skis, ice hockey sticks, <b>lacrosse</b> <b>sticks</b> and archery bows, were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, titanium or composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of golf clubs {{commonly known as the}} woods, the heads of which were traditionally made of persimmon wood {{in the early days of}} the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of drivers) carbon-fiber composites.|$|E

500|$|The {{object of}} the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a <b>lacrosse</b> <b>stick</b> or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by {{ultimately}} hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The triangular head of the <b>lacrosse</b> <b>stick</b> has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the <b>lacrosse</b> <b>stick,</b> players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact. [...] The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal. It is sometimes referred to as the [...] "fastest sport on two feet".|$|R
