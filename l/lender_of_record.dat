50|$|Overall, the Federal Reserve {{has hardly}} ever acted as the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort {{it was meant}} to be. Some say its <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort {{policies}} have jeopardized its operational independence and have put taxpayers at risk. Norbert J.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze rigorously the role <b>of</b> a <b>Lender</b> <b>of</b> Last Resort by {{providing}} a framework where the distinction between insolvency and illiquidity is not clearly cut. Determining the optimal <b>Lender</b> <b>of</b> Last Resort policy requires a careful modeling of the structure of the interbank market and of the closure policy. In our set up, the results depend upon the existence of moral hazard. If the main source of moral hazard is the banks’ lack of incentives to screen loans, then the <b>Lender</b> <b>of</b> Last Resort may have to intervene to improve the e¢ciency of an unsecured interbank market; if instead, the main source of moral hazard is loans monitoring, then the interbank market should be secured and the <b>Lender</b> <b>of</b> Last Resort should never intervene. <b>Lender</b> <b>of</b> Last Resort, interbank market, liquidity...|$|R
50|$|The {{discussion}} {{on the need for}} an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort is more controversial than for the domestic function. While most authors agree {{that there is a need}} for a national <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort and argue only about the specific set-up, there is no agreement about the basic question of whether there can be an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort. There are mainly two opposing groups: one group (Capie and Schwartz) says that an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort (ILOLR) is technically impossible, but the other group (Fischer, Obstfeld, Goodhardt and Huang) wants a modified International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assume this role.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades a {{consensus}} has emerged {{that it is impossible}} to disentangle liquidity shocks from solvency shocks. As a consequence the classical <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort rules, as defined by Thornton and Bagehot, based on lending to solvent illiquid institutions appear ill-suited to this environment. We summarize here the main contributions that have developed considering this new paradigm and discuss how institutional features relating to bank closure policy influences <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort and other safety net issues. We devote particular emphasis to the analysis of systemic risk and contagion in banking and the role <b>of</b> the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort to prevent it. <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort, systemic risk, contagion, bank closure, liquidity, discount window...|$|R
40|$|We study {{an economy}} where agents {{are subject to}} {{liquidity}} demand shocks, and banks arise endogenously to insure consumers against these shocks. In this environment we evaluate the desirability <b>of</b> a <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort who can provide liquidity loans to banks in distress. In the absence <b>of</b> a <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort, the economy has a unique, stationary equilibrium. The introduction of unlimited and costless <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort services allows the economy to achieve a steady state allocation that is pareto optimal. However, this economy also displays a continuum of hyperin‡ationary equilibria. We then explore restrictions on the provision <b>of</b> <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort services that rule out such monetary instability while preserving some of the e¢ciency obtained by unrestricted <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort services. When the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort charges an interest rate on liquidity loans, the economy has a unique steady state equilibrium, and when the interest rate charged is high enough, no hyperin‡ationary equilibria arise. Finally, when the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort faces an upper bound on loanable funds, there is again a unique long-run equilibrium, and when the upper bound on loanable funds is small enough, hyperin‡ationary equilibria are ruled out.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence and}} intensity of crises in the international financial markets during the 1990 s have given new impetus to the debate on reform of the international financial system. Much of the discussion focuses on the idea <b>of</b> an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort which could provide liquidity to ensure {{the stability of the}} international financial system. This paper responds {{to the question of whether}} an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort is necessary by presenting both the differences and the similarities between a domestic financial market and an international one. This comparison will show that in regard to those aspects which justify the existence <b>of</b> a <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort at the national level, the two types of financial markets are no different: If commercial banks are engaging in maturity and liquidity transformation, then the existence <b>of</b> a <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort is a prerequisite to stable and crisis-free development of financial markets. Both the recent financial crises, and the developments which can be observed in the banking sectors of Latin America and Eastern Europe, provide empirical evidence for this thesis. In these regions, banking sectors are emerging which are increasingly dominated by foreign banks, and thus have indirect access to an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort. At the same time, there is an increasing tendency within emerging markets to introduce regulations which limit the extent to which transformation is performed in financial markets, and thus to limit as far as possible the risks which make an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort necessary.

We compare two different arrangements: {{one in which}} the international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort injects international liquidity into financial markets, and one in which its resources are used to back domestic banking safety nets. We argue that these arrangements have very different institutional implications: the first one implies an international <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort with unlimited resources (a global central bank), while the second one could be operated by a limited ‘international banking fund’. This fund, however, would have to be closely involved in the supervision of domestic banking systems. Both arrangements would require important changes in the global financial architecture.

40|$|In this study, {{the main}} {{focus is on the}} {{question}} whether the possible role of central banks as <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort affect banks' risk-taking incentives in a manner that makes banks more susceptible to moral hazard. The work consists of four interrelated chapters. In chapter 2, the origins and historical evolution <b>of</b> the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort are discussed. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the theoretical literature concerning the reasons why {{there is a need for}} a <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort in the first place. In chapter 4, it is examined on a general level whether there is a connection between moral hazard and financial safety nets, including the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort. In chapter 5, a specific model is developed in order to analyze the particular question <b>of</b> whether <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort policies cause moral ha-zard. It is argued in chapter 5 that in circumstances where the opacity of banks prevents the depositors from providing market discipline, banks' ex ante risk-taking incentives may indeed be influenced through <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort policies. Furthermore, <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort facilities can be used to a certain extent as a complement to other regulatory policies in the provision of proper incentives to banks. Specifically, if banks' eligibility for support from the <b>lender</b> <b>of</b> last resort can be made condi-tional on their initial risk choice, this facility may be used as an effective complement to minimum capital requirements.
