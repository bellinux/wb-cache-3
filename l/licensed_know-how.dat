With its BEPS initiative the OECD (2013) aims at taxing intangibles {{in accordance with}} value creation although difficulties in determining the jurisdiction in which value creation occurs are acknowledged. The European Commission promotes {{the introduction of a}} Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) to neutralize profit shifting. The drawback of this proposal is that incentives are set to relocate R&D activities to low-tax countries. This is the background against which the present paper pleads for a regulated and internationally coordinated split of the profits earned with <b>licensed</b> <b>know-how...</b>|$|E
40|$|Commercialisation of {{intellectual}} property (IP), particularly patent becomes an important agenda in most universities. Patents that were licensed to established companies in return for royalties recognised as a traditional mode to commercialise university IPs. As government funding are getting harder to obtain, and demand from the stake holders to see universities play more important role in local economic development, universities are prompts to look at spin-off formations as an alternative route for technology commercialisation. This paper is trying {{to look into the}} process of decision making in commercialisation of university patents through spin-off formation. A single case of one university in Scotland is adopted in this study. Six patents from university portfolio’s patents were selected, which were licensed to spin-off companies. Companies that <b>licensed</b> <b>know-how</b> or IPs other than patents were excluded. The inventors of these 6 patents were interviewed in depth using semi-structured questionnaires, which were recorded and later transcribed. The data were then analysed using a case basis and cross-case analysis aided with Nvivo software. The study found that the decision making to seek patents protection was made by the inventors, and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO). On the other hand, the decision to commercialise the patents through the spinoffs creation were initiated by the inventors alone, not by the TTO. The study also revealed that the stage or performance of the technologies and the entrepreneurial characteristics of the inventors lead their patents were commercialised through spin-offs. Inventors industrial working experiences prior to their research positions in the University, were able to recognise the potential values of their technologies. This factor was found to be the most significant that drove them to form spin-offs. Their experiences meant they had better knowledge about potential market, market size as well as the standing of their technologies in the market place. Other important factors were the role and supports of Technology Transfer Office as well as the availability of funding. The result of this study could help policy makers in universities to consider: what are the characteristics of the inventions and the inventors, the availability of funding as well as the roles of technology transfer offices in their decision-making to spin-offs...|$|E

While the literature tend to use in-house R&D as a proxy for absorption capacity and be silent about where this ability of doing R&D has come from, this paper has tried to dig out the origin of absorption capacity after defining it first as being able to conduct one s own in-house R&D and second as being thereby able to generate innovation outcomes. This paper distinguish three forms of foreign technology acquisitions based on the unique archive data from Korea, such as <b>know-how</b> only <b>licensing,</b> <b>know-how</b> plus patent <b>licensing,</b> and patent only licensing. This data show {{that the majority of the}} Korean firms started with <b>know-how</b> only <b>licensing,</b> while licensing involving patents came later. Then, an econometric analysis finds that <b>know-how</b> <b>licensing</b> associated with imported capital facility has led to firms to start their own in-house R&D, whereas licensing involving patents only tend not to be significantly related to conducting R&D, which suggests possibly substituting effect between foreign patent introduction and doing own R&D. A similar econometric exercise shows that conducting own in-house R&D as well as <b>licensing</b> of <b>know-how</b> has led the firms to be able to generate innovations or patent applications at later stages. This study shows that before firms being able to do in-house R&D and innovations, there waslearning process involving foreign technology, especially tacit knowledge in the form of know-how, which is the origin of the absorptive capacit...|$|R
40|$|A key {{source of}} {{economic}} growth at present {{is the development of}} regions of Russia. In this regard, in the regions, {{there is a need to}} strengthen and develop human, intellectual and innovative potential. The material factors of production, labour, patents, <b>licenses,</b> <b>know-how,</b> model programs, finding growing application in all spheres of society and its subjects are the basic forms of materialization of intellectual potential. The problem of strengthening the development of regions based on the management of human, innovative and intellectual potential is currently not sufficiently considered by economists. The need for management of human, innovative and intellectual potential at the present stage is due to three main factors: the state of the economy of regions of Russia, the shortcomings of the market mechanism of self-regulation, innovation, and General economic goals of socio-economic development of regions of Russia. The presence in the Russian regions significant potential in combination with high-tech industries can be a Foundation for implementing large-scale growth of innovative activity of the country. Innovations affect the development of the productive forces, they contribute to increased welfare in the region, improving the quality of life, level of education, thereby increasing the innovative potential of the region. Innovative opportunities in our view, are an important component of the integration potential. They represent opportunities and strategies, the implementation of which allows to ensure the planned and progressive development through a purposeful transformation of the innovations in innovation. In turn, innovative capabilities depend on the available regional resources. In our opinion, the development of theoretical provisions and recommendations for the management and use of human, intellectual and innovative potential of the region can help the user to correctly Orient in the current situation and to develop a set of measures for stable and steady development of regions of Russia...|$|R
40|$|Open {{source and}} open source {{software}} development have been interesting phenomena during the past decade. Traditional business models do not apply with open source, where the actual product is free. However, {{it is possible to}} make business with open source, even successfully, but the question is: how? The aim {{of this study is to}} find the key factors of successfully making business out of commercial {{open source software}} development. The task is achieved by finding the factors that influence open source projects, finding the relation between those factors, and find out why some factors explain the success more than others. The literature review concentrates first on background of open innovation, open source and open source software. Then business models, critical success factors and success measures are examined. Based on existing literature a framework was created. The framework contains categorized success factors that influence software projects in general as well as open source software projects. The main categories of success factors in software business are divided into community management, technology management, project management and market management. In order to find out which of the factors based on the existing literature are the most critical, empirical research was done by conducting unstructured personal interviews. The main finding based on the interviews is that the critical success factors in open source software business do not differ from those in traditional software business or in fact from those in any other business. Some factors in the framework came out in the interviews that can be considered as key factors: establishing and communicating hierarchy (community management), localization (technology management), good <b>license</b> <b>know-how</b> and IPR management (project management), and effective market management (market management). The critical success factors according to the interviewees are not listed in the framework: low price, good product and good business model development...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{international}} and domestic technology transfers on firms' productivity performance in a sample of 448 Belgian innovating firms during 2003 - 2006. Technology transfers may occur through R&D contracting, purchase of <b>licenses</b> and <b>know-how,</b> purchase of specialized machinery, hiring of specialized personnel, and various informal channels. Estimates of a dynamic productivity model show that firms engaging in international knowledge transfer strategies record substantially and significantly higher productivity growth. While we do not find statistical evidence of complementarity between international and domestic transfers, the largest impact on productivity is found if firms combine international and domestic transfer strategies, suggesting that a diverse external technology sourcing strategy combining local know-how with know-how from abroad is most effective. Such combined domestic and international technology sourcing strategies are associated with firms' basic research orientation, R&D intensity, and the successful use of technology protection strategies to appropriate the benefits of innovation efforts. Foreign multinational firms are more likely to adopt technology transfer strategies solely focusing on international transfers. Multinational firms do not exhibit faster productivity growth if the effects of technology transfers and R&D are taken into account. © The Author 2012.

40|$|Presently it is {{commonly}} acceptable {{to believe that the}} most efficient way to economic progress rests upon scientific research competently directed and used to develop of technique and new technologies. Science, deciding about an intellectual level and prosperity of society, became a motive force for so called, New Economy. The stimulation of scientific research and practical application of their results is the subject of economic policy of each modern state. Both scientific and techniquely achievements have become valuable, needed in the world because of their competitivity, commodities and may generate large profits such as issued <b>licenses,</b> <b>know-how</b> and technology, chiefly considered as services. That is OECD and EU in their leading research manifest more need for integrated approach to analyze the problems connected with economic innovation and to treat them in dynamic meaning by focusing simultaneously on the creation of innovational environment and on proper support to achieve competitivity. In this sense appears the true meaning of the state's innovational policy commonly speaking proinnovational. Usually, the state's innovational policy is understood as efficient support for innovational entrepreneurship of legal and natural persons. Primarily it aims at increasing of competitivity of domestic companies and efficiency of public service, which leads to increase of standard of living of society and in particular prosperity and socio-economic security, of quality of natural environment, increase of export and employment, as well as speed-up acquiring of civilisational characterstics. While applying we have to consider strengthening. Moreover, it should be underlined that innovational policy aims in Poland at constructing the policy of catching —up. Even though it has been 11 years since Poland began transformation towards free market economy and democracy, not all results may satisfy expectations of the Polish society. Many modifications are stimulated by external factors, such as decrease of science and technology sector, reduction of research and development activity, provoked by meager financial funds and reduction in number of scholars caused by slower pace in adopting new conditions of free market economy comparing to human resources in private sector, on the other, the trend is linked with lower demand for products of scientific and research. Since Poland is associated with EU countries and attempts have been made to become a member state of EU, it may obtain financial aid for its innovational policy from EU funds. The paper considers not assertions of theoretical assumptions of a hypothetical innovational state policy, but focuses on the results of existing Polish policy in this field, coming from two institutional levels such as the Committee of Scientific Research and Strategy of Development Department Ministry of Economy. Both institutions, willing to best use the opportunity of financial aid, joined their efforts.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{involves more}} than just the permission to use knowledge covered by patents; the transfer of know-how is critical to the successful utilization of the transferred technology. However, know-how is typically difficult to codify, costly to transfer, and hence, difficult to contract upon. Using a principal-agent model I show that simple arms length contracts can accomplish the transfer know-how. The key to the success of arms length contracts is the complementarity between know-how and patents. The model explains why patents and know-how are bundled together in licensing contracts. It shows why licensing has limitations as a strategy for appropriating rents from innovation. The paper points to the key role that patent scope plays in determining the efficiency of know-how transfer and shows that broader patents can improve the efficiency of technology transfer, even when important components of the technology (know-how) are not protected by patents. <b>Know-how,</b> <b>licensing,</b> patents J.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a globalized}} world, the {{competition}} is coming to heat {{in the area of}} creating “new technologies”, and consequently, regional integration attempts are gaining momentum. The export of advanced technological products reflects a country's ability to commercialize the results of researches and technological innovations in the international markets. In addition, the share of countries in the export of advanced technology across the world is an important indicator of the competitiveness of those countries in the global technology market. Beside the advanced technological products, countries can also purchase and sell information which is intangible. This transaction is measured via “Technological Balance of Payments” that records the technical information and services that a country conducts the export and import of. TBP may give a clearer and more accurate opinion in terms of the development of an economy when considered along with other macro-economic parameters in a holistic approach, not by its own. TBP has a few important attributes. The first one is that it measures the international technology transfer related to the <b>licenses,</b> patents, the <b>know-how,</b> research and technical assistance. The second one is that TBP is the component of general balance of payments that reveals the international commercial and economic relations in a foreign exchange-weighted and statistical way. Countries that can perform the production and commerce of technology in a rapid, quality way and in accordance with competitive rules always remain at the top of development league or push the top of the list. Today, it is evident that a country can enhance its economic, and consequently, political efficiency {{to the extent that it}} can be competent in science and technology, and therefore, innovation; and accordingly, it can be decisive in the regional and global power balance. The technological power of a country requires the competitive power along with it. While the globalization is making in what amount countries produce and use the weapon of technology, it forces Turkey to record the technological data. This study aims to discuss the application problems of science and technology and reveal the related obstacles/challenges with TBP.
