5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings are {{thrown into the}} air and fall <b>like</b> <b>snow,</b> a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the film, the character model department was headed by Joe Grant, whose department was responsible for the building of three-dimensional clay models of the characters in the film, known as maquettes. These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists. The model makers also built working models of Geppetto's cuckoo clocks, as well as Stromboli's gypsy wagon and the Coachman's carriage. However, owing to the difficulty animating a realistic moving vehicle, the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation. Then each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox. The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the rostrum camera. <b>Like</b> <b>Snow</b> White, live-action footage [...] was shot for Pinocchio with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime, supervised by Hamilton Luske. Rather than tracing, which would result in stiff unnatural movement, the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation (though slightly exaggerated).|$|E
500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess looks so much <b>like</b> <b>Snow</b> White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid-April, Confederate Gen. Johnston {{met with}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Greensboro, North Carolina. [...] He confessed:Our {{people are tired}} of the war, feel {{themselves}} whipped, and will not fight. [...] Our country is overrun, its military resources greatly diminished, while the enemy’s military power and resources were never greater and may be increased to any extent desired. … My small force is melting away <b>like</b> <b>snow</b> before the sun.During the Carolinas Campaign, Slocum's army was heavily engaged at the Battle of Averasborough, on March 15–16, 1865, and the Battle of Bentonville, on March 19, 1865, where Slocum successfully held off a surprise assault by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. [...] After Slocum’s defeat of the Confederate forces at Bentonville, an officer of Sherman’s staff wrote: “Slocum was more than equal to the necessity of the hour, and his success justified General Sherman’s selection of him as commander of the Left Wing of the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially the V-1 {{launching}} sites had {{storage buildings}} that were curved {{at the end}} to protect the contents against damage from air attacks. On aerial reconnaissance pictures these storage from above looked <b>like</b> <b>snow</b> skis ("ski sites"). An October 28, 1943 intelligence report regarding construction at Bois Carré near Yvrench prompted No. 170 Squadron RAF reconnaissance sortie E/463 on November 3 which detected [...] "ski-shaped buildings 240-270 feet long." [...] By November 1943, 72 of the ski sites had been located by allied reconnaissance, and Operation Crossbow began bombing the original ski sites on December 5, 1943. [...] Nazi Germany subsequently began constructing modified sites with limited structures that could be completed quickly, as necessary. This also allowed the modified sites to be quickly repaired after bombing. However, the work to complete a modified site before launching allowed the allied photographic interpreters to predict on June 11, 1944 that the V-1 attacks would begin within 48 hours, and the first attacks began on June 13.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, Sleeping Beauty {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from film critics. Bosley Crowther, writing {{in his review}} for The New York Times, complimented that [...] "the colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands", but criticized its familiarity with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. He further wrote that [...] "the princess looks so much <b>like</b> <b>Snow</b> White they could {{be a couple of}} Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years. And she has the same magical rapport with the little creatures of the woods. The witch is the same slant-eyed Circe who worked her evil on Snow White. And the three good fairies could be maiden sisters of the misogynistic seven dwarfs." [...] Variety praised the singing voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley and noted that [...] "some of the best parts of the picture are those dealing with the three good fairies, spoken and sung by Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy." [...] The New York Daily News described the film as [...] "enchanting".|$|E

I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was <b>like</b> <b>snow</b> fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
