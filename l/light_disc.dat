50|$|Congo grass can be {{established}} from seed which is inexpensive although {{it needs to be}} stored for six months after harvest. Alternatively the grass can {{be established}} vegetatively from stem cuttings with root nodes. It requires light soils with moderately to high fertility though it does not tolerate strongly acidic conditions and performs best in a well-drained soil. It requires a reasonably high rainfall, though it can endure dry spells, with 1000 mm or more being preferable. It requires a well prepared seed bed but <b>light</b> <b>disc</b> harrowing gives good results. Although it responds well to light, with light intensity increasing yields, it can also be planted for grazing under coconut plantations.

40|$|During {{the process}} of planet formation, the planet-discs {{interactions}} might excite (or damp) the orbital eccentricity of the planet. In this paper, we present two long (t∼ 3 × 10 ^ 5 orbits) numerical simulations: (a) one (with a relatively <b>light</b> <b>disc,</b> M_ d/M_ p= 0. 2) where the eccentricity initially stalls before growing at later times and (b) one (with a more massive disc, M_ d/M_ p= 0. 65) with fast growth and a late decrease of the eccentricity. We recover the well-known result that a more massive disc promotes a faster initial growth of the planet eccentricity. However, at late times the planet eccentricity decreases in the massive disc case, but increases in the <b>light</b> <b>disc</b> case. Both simulations show periodic eccentricity oscillations superimposed on a growing/decreasing trend and a rapid transition between fast and slow pericentre precession. The peculiar and contrasting evolution of the eccentricity of both planet and disc in the two simulations can be understood by invoking a simple toy model where the disc is treated as a second point-like gravitating body, subject to secular planet-planet interaction and eccentricity pumping/damping provided by the disc. We show how the counterintuitive result that the more massive simulation produces a lower planet eccentricity at late times can {{be understood in terms}} of the different ratios of the disc-to-planet angular momentum in the two simulations. In our interpretation, at late times the planet eccentricity can increase more in low-mass discs rather than in high-mass discs, contrary to previous claims in the literature.

40|$|As {{a test of}} the {{hypothesis}} that cyclic nucleotides {{play a role in the}} regulation of retinomotor movements and disc shedding in the photoreceptor-pigment epithelial complex, we have used an in vitro eyecup preparation that sustains both disc shedding and cone retinomotor movements, Eyecups were prepared in white light from animals in which both shedding and cone movement had been blocked by 4 d of constant-light treatment. In eyecups incubated for 3 h in <b>light,</b> <b>disc</b> shedding was negligible and cones remained in the light-adapted (contracted) position. In eyecups incubated in darkness, however, a massive shedding response (dominated by rod photoreceptors) was induced, and at the same time cone photoreceptors elongated to their dark-adapted position. In eyecups incubated in light dbcAMP promoted cone elongation and thus mimicked darkness; the dbcAMP effect was potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitors papaverine and 3 - isobutylmethylxanthine. In eyecups incubated in darkness, on the other hand, both phosphodiesterase inhibitors and dbcAMP reduced the phagosome content of the pigment epithelium. The effects of dbcAMP on the cone elongation and rod shedding appear to be specific in that dbcGMP, adenosine, and adenosine 5 '-monophosphate had no significant effect. Our results suggest that cAMP plays a role in the regulation of both retinomotor movements and disc shedding...|$|E

The experiment started in December 2008 and consisted of the comparison of the following four types of seed incorporation by <b>light</b> <b>disc</b> harrowing: (1) broadcast sowing without seed incorporation; disc harrowing before (2) or after (3) planting, and (4) disc harrowing before and after planting. Ninety days after planting, the number of legume plants/m 2 and the percentage of ground cover by the plants varied between the treatments tested; however, the treatments had no effect on the dry matter accumulation of forage legumes. Disc harrowing before planting yielded superior results compared to the treatments without disc harrowing and disc harrowing after planting. At the end of the experimental period, the plots contained Arachis, Centrosema, Stylosanthes, and Pueraria. The dry matter accumulated by Centrosema corresponded to 73 % of total dry matter yield of the plots. The participation of Arachis, Centrosema and Stylosanthes in final dry matter composition of the plots varied according to establishment method.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the economic feasibility of small scale organic production of rice, common bean and maize in Goias State, Brazil. During 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 growing seasons, rice, common bean and maize were produced at the organic farm of Embrapa Rice and Beans in five mulching systems (fallow, Crotalaria juncea, Cajanus cajan, Mucuna aterrima and Sorghum bicolor), with and without tillage. Soil tillage consisted of heavy disc harrowing followed by <b>light</b> <b>disc</b> harrowing. All operations and used inputs were recorded. Based on those records, the production costs for each crop were estimated for each cropping season. The costs included operations like sowing, ploughing, harrowing, spraying, fertilizer broadcasting and harvesting, as well as inputs like seeds, inoculant strains of Rhizobium, neem oil and organic fertilizers. The benefits include the gross revenue obtained by multiplying the production amount with the market price for non-organic products. For the purpose of analysis of competitiveness of organic production in comparison to conventional farming the market prices assumed were those of conventional production. In the analysis, the costs of certification were not considered yet due to lack of certifiers in the region. For comparison between traits, net revenue, the benefit-cost-ratio (BCR) and the break even point were used. In 2004 / 05 growing season the BCR varied from 0. 27 for common bean on S. bicolor mulch system with tillage up to 4. 05 for green harvested maize produced after C. juncea in no tillage system. Common bean and rice were not economically viable in this growing season. In 2005 / 06 growing season the BCR varied between 0. 75 for common bean after S. bicolor in tillage system and 4. 50 for green harvested maize produced after fallow in no tillage system. In this season common bean was economically viable in leguminous mulching systems and green harvested maize was viable in all mulching systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of the {{important}} aspects of attentional processes in sport performance is sustained attention during task execution. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the ability to maintain attention during a serial reaction time task performance in expert handball players (n = 12) and non-athletes (n = 12). Participants perform a FitLight TrainerTM (Fitlight Sports Corp., Canada) test protocol configured by the PDA controller which consisted of 10 series of simple motor reaction task to visual stimuli appearing on 8 wireless <b>light</b> <b>discs.</b> Each of the 10 series included 22 reactions. Ability to maintain attention was determined by analyzing the variability in results during testing, e. g. the total time of test execution and the average reaction time to visual stimulus in each subsequent series. The main finding in our study was that Non-athletes in comparison to Athletes had: (1) longer total time of test execution; (2) longer reaction time; (3) and higher variability in results during task performance. The results indicate a higher level of ability to maintain attention in handball players. Key words: sustained attention; handball; reaction tim...|$|R

40|$|We use {{high-resolution}} three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations {{to study}} the evolution of self-gravitating binary protoplanetary discs. Heating by shocks and cooling is included. We consider different orbital separations and masses of the discs. Massive discs (M∼ 0. 1 M⊙) that fragment in isolation {{as a result of}} gravitational instability develop only transient overdensities in binary systems with a separation of about 60 au. This is true even when the cooling time is significantly shorter than the orbital time because efficient heating owing to strong tidally induced spiral shocks dominates. The resulting temperatures, above 200 K, would vaporize water ice in the outer disc, posing a problem even for the other model of giant planet formation, core accretion. <b>Light</b> <b>discs</b> (M∼ 0. 01 M⊙) do not fragment but remain cold because their low self-gravity inhibits strong shocks. Core accretion would not be hampered in them. At separations of about 120 au, tidally induced spiral shocks weaken significantly and fragmentation occurs similarly to isolated systems. If disc instability is the main formation mechanism for giant planets, ongoing surveys targeting binary systems should find considerably fewer planets in systems with separations below 100 a...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Podkletnov {{effect is}} an unexplained loss of weight of between 0. 05 % and 0. 07 % {{detected}} in test masses suspended above supercooled levitating superconducting discs exposed to AC magnetic fields. A larger weight loss {{of up to}} 0. 5 % was seen over a disc spun at 5000 rpm. The effect {{has so far been}} observed in only one laboratory. Here, a new model for inertia that assumes that inertial mass is caused by Unruh radiation which is subject to a Hubble-scale Casimir effect (called MiHsC or quantised inertia) is applied to this anomaly. When the disc is exposed to the AC magnetic field it accelerates, and MiHsC then predicts that the inertial mass of the test mass increases, so that to conserve momentum it must accelerate upwards against freefall by 0. 0058 m/s 2 or 0. 06 % of g, in good agreement with the weight loss observed. With disc rotation, MiHsC predicts an additional weight loss, but 34 times smaller than the rotational effect observed. MiHsC suggests that the effect should increase with disc radius and rotation rate, the AC magnetic field strength (as observed), and also with increasing latitude and for <b>lighter</b> <b>discs...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Drivers {{are usually}} {{recognized}} by their sharp, beveled edge and {{have most of}} their mass concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally throughout. They are designed to travel farther distances at greater speeds and are mostly used for tee-off and other long distance throws. Drivers are often divided into different categories. For example, Innova Discs divides their discs into Distance Drivers and Fairway Drivers, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a distance driver and a mid-range disc. Discraft divides their drivers into 3 categories: Long Drivers, Extra Long Drivers, and Maximum Distance Drivers. Because the physics of a disc require [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "flick", which means putting spin on the disc, new players generally find that throwing a distance driver accurately can be somewhat difficult and will require experience with golf disc response. This {{is why it is}} better for players to begin with fairway drivers, long drivers, or even mid-ranges, and incorporate maximum distance drivers as their strength and disc control increases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} the relative angle between the stellar rotation axis and the circumstellar disc axis of a star that forms in a stellar cluster from the collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud. This is an inherently chaotic environment with variable accretion, both in terms of rate and the angular momentum of the material, and dynamical interactions between stars. We find that the final stellar rotation axis and disc spin axis can be strongly misaligned, but this occurs primarily when the disc is truncated by a dynamical encounter so that the final disc rotation axis depends simply on what fell in last. This may lead to planetary systems with orbits that are misaligned with the stellar rotation axis, but only if the final disc contains enough mass to form planets. We also {{investigate the}} time variability of the inner disc spin axis, which is likely to determine the direction of a protostellar jet. We find that the jet direction varies more strongly for <b>lighter</b> <b>discs,</b> such as those that have been truncated by dynamical interactions or have suffered a period of rapid accretion. Finally, we note that variability of the angular momentum of the material accreting by a star implies that the internal velocity field of such stars may be more complicated than that of aligned differential rotation.
