A collector is tracking the sun during daytime, focusing the direct sun irradiance via Fresnel lenses into optical fibers, which guide the solar light into the building. The illumination properties of the system have been characterized. The energy saving due to reduced need of artificial lighting have been calculated and methods for balancing the artificial lights in the test site have been evaluated. The illumination at the test site using solar light was at least as high as when using the artificial lights and even higher at very clear days. The <b>luminous</b> flux <b>output</b> (500 lm) was somewhat lower than specified by the manufacturer (550 lm) at 100 000 lx direct sun illuminance.

However, for a 20 m SP 3 system the <b>luminous</b> flux <b>output</b> (400 lm) at 100 000 lx was higher than specified (350 lm). The SP 3 system of Parans provides high quality solar light. It has a fuller spectrum close to the spectrum of the sun compared to the fluorescent lights at the test site. The correlated color temperature of the system was 5800 ± 300 K and the color rendering index 84. 9 ± 0. 5. The lighting energy saved due to decreased need for artificial light was estimated to 19 % in Uppsala which has 1790 annual sun hours. The savings in Italy, which has 3400 sun hours, is 46 %. Additional saving, especially in warmer countries can be obtained due to decreased need for cooling in the building as the solar luminaires provide negligible heat to the indoor air. Economical saving could also be realized by improved well-being of the occupants spending time under the solar luminaires. Three ways of balancing the artificial light due to sunshine fluctuations have been investigated. The global horizontal irradiance {{could not be used}} as a control signal for balancing the artificial lights but a pyranometer attached to the SP 3 sun tracking collector was usable.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceFred L. HaslerThis paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} using LED modules as the primary light source for office buildings’ lighting systems. The LED lamps are the newest mass-produced lamps today; they have many insurmountable advantages compared to other light sources, like long lamp life, high efficacy, and low heat emission. Because of these advantages, owners and occupants of buildings can benefit greatly from the application of LED luminaires. The main focus {{of this paper is}} in 4 categories, which include the reliability of published data, occupant comfort, energy efficiency, and the life cycle costs of building lighting systems. LED light sources are compared to other primary light sources, which include fluorescent and incandescent lamps, of low ceiling office spaces from these 4 categories. The reliability of published data discussion covers color rendering index (CRI), correlated color temperatures (CCT), lamp life, and efficacy of the different type of lamps. The criteria of LED lamps are the most emphasized point of this section. The current CRI, efficacy, and lamp life evaluation systems are not suitable for LED lamps, and this paper {{discusses the}} practical value of each of these published data in office lighting system design. Some technical reports presented in this paper show that high CRI values of LED light sources do not directly link to excellent color rendition. However, LED light sources can have similar spectrum power distributions as natural light, and offer adequate visual comfort. Efficacy and lamp life are in the same situation. Even though, the published values do not necessarily reflect the real life performance of LED lamps, they often still have the longest lamp life and highest efficacy. Human comfort is the second factor discussed. Engineers and lighting designers consider illuminance level, color rendering ability, and glare of lighting systems to be deciding factors of human comfort from a lighting design perspective. However, many medical studies show that the human is much more sensitive to the correlated color of light sources. Light sources must vary <b>output</b> <b>luminous</b> flux and correlated color temperatures over time to help occupants reach optimum office task productivity and maintain health and visual comfort. LED lamps are the only light source that can practically change both the <b>output</b> <b>luminous</b> flux and correlate color temperature without heavy extra investments in equipment, which makes it the perfect candidate for this category. Energy efficiency is the third discussion point presented in this paper. Efficacy is a widely adopted term for evaluating the energy efficiency of a lamp, which describes the ratio of the output illuminance and input power. Because the output illuminance of LED lamps is decided not only by the illuminant bodies, but also many other electronic components in the lamps, some experts suggest that using efficacy to judge LED lamps is biased. This paper states the author’s position on whether efficacy can adequately describe the efficiency of LED lamps. Costs are also an inevitable point of this paper. LED lamps have the reputation of being the most expensive type of light source, but marketing data shows that the price of LEDs has been dropping dramatically recently. Moreover, Haitz’s law predicts that the price of LEDs will drop even more in the future. In this paper, the lifecycle costs of a light system have also been addressed across different types of light sources. Some crucial drawbacks of LED lamps, such as narrow photometric distribution and thermal damage control, are also addressed in this paper. Scientists and engineers still have not found the perfect solution to these drawbacks, but they are not significant enough to jeopardize the application of LED lamps in most architectural lighting design cases. According to the finding of this paper, LED lamps are the mainstream light source of future office lighting systems. The author also gives some suggestions for using LED lamps as primary light sources in office lighting system design applications {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} several reliability issues for LED lighting systems. Firstly, a full survey on exsiting LED ballast has been conducted, and critical design challenges are classified on power level basis (low/ middle/ high power). Specifically, reliability issues have been highlighted, and three major factors have been stipulated: issue of electrolytic capacitor; issue of current imbalance in parallel LED strings; issue of LED junction temperature. The information revealed in the whole survey provide important design criteria for existing LED system designs and guidance for further research directions by pointing out the critical design problems. Two possible solutions for Electrolytic-Capacitor-Less LED Ballasts are proposed regarding the first reliability issue. A series of novel passive LED ballasts are proposed. They {{are found to be}} suitable for outdoor applications, such as street lighting applications, where the ability to withstand extreme weather conditions are of major concern. When compared with those in switched mode power supplies, these passive ballasts have good power factor performance and comparatively high efficiency. In addition, an active solution has been developed for indoor applications. Its circuit topology is derived from existing differential inverter topologies and inherits same merits such as simple structure, reduced size, and low cost. Self-configurable current-mirror techniques have been derived and developed afterwards to cope with the current imbalance issue for system with parallel LED strings. In contrast with traditional current sharing methods (either linear type or switched type), the proposed techniques offer a simple solution without the need of independent current references, complicated controllers and auxiliary power supplies. These features are favored by outdoor applications and such re-configurable mirror circuits are originally designed for passive LED ballast as post-current regulators. The techniques are further extended with the ability to tolerate possible circuit failure, such as short circuit and open circuit fault. Then, a new non-contact method for the measurement of both junction-to-case thermal resistance and junction temperature in a LED device has been proposed, with respect to the third reliability issue. Traditionally the direct measurement of junction temperature in LED is not easy without the help of sophisticated methods such as laser or expensive equipment like TeraLED Transient Thermal Tester system. In contrast, the proposed method requires only the external LED power, luminous flux, and heatsink temperature information. The method can be further adopted as a simple tool by engineers to check the internal temperature states in a practical LED system for regulation and evaluation purpose. Finally, a thermal design methodology has been developedfor an LED street lamp system powered by a weakly regulated renewable small power grid. It has been successfully incorporated in the proposed passive LED ballast, such that the LED system can provide the least <b>output</b> <b>luminous</b> fluctuation against line voltage variation. It is envisaged that, with the proposed design methodology, such lighting system will not only provide high reliability, with potential lifetime exceeding 10 years, but with a proven feature of reduced light fluctuation, furthermore, it is found that the passive LED system can act as a smart load and has the potential of reducing the energy storage requirement for smart grids. These merits are attractive to public lighting systems powered by future renewable power grids. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

In particular, devices with emitting layer made by EB irradiation were successfully fabricated on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate. Device properties were evaluated and compared with those obtained using the conventional ultraviolet curing process. Smaller driving voltages and higher <b>luminous</b> <b>output</b> were observed for the EB treated samples as a consequence of a more cross-linked polymeric binder of the emitting layer generated. In addition, possible effects of EB overdose were also investigated; experiments revealed that excessively high doses can induce the degradation of both polymeric binder and emitting particles. Therefore, the feasibility of using the EB curing was proven to fabricate ACPEL devices, launching it as the next future technology for more sustainable, very fast, and one-step manufacturing of powder-based {{alternating current}} EL devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{alarming}} {{spread of}} bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics has warranted {{the study of}} alternative antimicrobial agents. Quorum sensing is a chemical cell-to-cell communication mechanism utilized by bacteria to coordinate group behaviors and establish infections. Quorum sensing is integral to bacterial survival, and therefore provides a unique target for antimicrobial therapy. In this study, silicon dioxide nanoparticles (Si-NP) were engineered to target the signaling molecules (i. e. acylhomoserine lactones (HSL)) used for quorum sensing in order to halt bacterial communication. Specifically, when Si-NP were surface functionalized with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), then added to cultures of bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), whose <b>luminous</b> <b>output</b> depends upon HSL-mediated quorum sensing, the cell-to-cell communication was dramatically reduced. Reductions in luminescence were further verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses of luminescence genes. Binding of AHLs to Si-NPs was examined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated that by delivering high concentrations of engineered NPs with associated quenching compounds, the chemical signals {{were removed from the}} immediate bacterial environment. In actively-metabolizing cultures, this treatment blocked the ability of bacteria to communicate and regulate quorum sensing, effectively silencing and isolating the cells. Si-NPs provide a scaffold and critical stepping-stone for more pointed developments in antimicrobial therapy, especially with regard to quorum sensing – a target that will reduce resistance pressures imposed by traditional antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{for seven}} {{infrared}} luminous starburst galaxies {{are reported in}} the mid-infrared from 8 - 18 microns using the Keck Telescopes with spatial resolution approaching the diffraction limit. All of the galaxies observed show evidence of strong interactions based on optical morphologies. For these galaxies, a substantial fraction, usually more than 50 %, of the infrared luminosity is generated in regions ranging in sizes from 100 pc [...] 1 Kpc. Nuclear starbursts often dominate the infrared luminosity, {{but this is not}} always true. In some galaxies, most notably NGC 6090, substantial infrared luminosity greatly in excess of the nuclear luminosity is generated in regions associated with the physical interaction between two galaxies. The radio emission is a good tracer of the location of high luminosity young stars. The visual/ultraviolet radiation output of the nearby star forming galaxies is dominated by emission from regions that are generally not producing the copious infrared luminosity of the systems. The regions of high infrared luminosity in local starburst galaxies are significantly smaller than the galaxies as a whole. The integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these galaxies are very different from the SEDs of the regions of star formation. If the SEDs of star-forming regions in these galaxies reflect the SEDs found in forming galaxies at high redshift, the distant galaxies should be dominated by the mid and far-infrared luminosity output far more than the integrated <b>luminous</b> <b>output</b> of nearby starburst galaxies would suggest.
