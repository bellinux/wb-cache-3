Three of Cartwright's early novels feature a character named Timothy Curtiz, named partly for Kurtz from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and partly for Cartwright's own brother. In Interior, Curtiz is in Africa investigating the disappearance of his father in 1959 while on a trip for National Geographic. In <b>Look</b> <b>At</b> <b>It</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way,</b> Curtiz {{is a columnist for}} Manhattan magazine while he is living in London, has a daughter named Gemma, {{and by the end of}} the novel has a partner named Victoria. In Masai Dreaming, Curtiz is in Africa researching a film about Claudia Cohn-Casson, and his relationship with Victoria is having [...] "complications." [...] <b>Look</b> <b>At</b> <b>It</b> <b>This</b> <b>Way</b> was made into a three-part, 180-minutes drama by the BBC in 1992, starring Kristin Scott Thomas; Cartwright wrote the screenplay.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the finale}} aired, fans and {{television}} critics alike have speculated {{as to whether}} or not Timothy Carter really was Red John. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, creator Bruno Heller further added to the speculation by saying, [...] "Jane wanted to know if this was Red John or not. And the guy gave him proof that he was. The question remains: Was that Red John? The larger question is: How does Jane get away with murder?" [...] Heller went on to say, [...] "What you get from that scene is what you should get. The viewer is supposed to be convinced. Patrick Jane is certain it's Red John... Thing is, Red John is a master of the mind game. If Red John wanted to die, maybe this is how he wanted to die. Or maybe he just wants Jane to think he's dead." [...] When asked whether or not this meant the end of the Red John storyline, Heller simply said, [...] "Well, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> If you... killed your worst enemy, would that be the end of the story? No. It would be the beginning of a whole different story." ...|$|E

Existing mobile authentication techniques are often cumbersome {{to use and}} also vulnerable to shoulder-surfing and smudge attacks. This paper focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating TouchIn, a two-factor authentication system on multi-touch mobile devices. TouchIn works by letting a user draw on the touchscreen with one or multiple fingers to unlock his mobile device, and the user is authenticated based on the geometric properties of his drawn curves {{as well as his}} behavioral and physiological characteristics. TouchIn allows the user to draw on arbitrary regions on the touchscreen without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> nice sightless feature makes TouchIn very easy to use and also robust to shoulder-surfing and smudge attacks. Comprehensive experiments on Android devices confirm the high security and usability of TouchIn...|$|R
