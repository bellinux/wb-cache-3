Her breakthrough findings helped develop new theories of visual functioning. These theories represent a foundation from which a professional can understand the visual functioning of an individual with low vision. Providing opportunities for individuals {{to learn how to use}} their vision to improve their image of the world and become more independent in their everyday activities became a new goal for teachers of the visually impaired. The decisive factors that decide whether a person will use their vision or not, are the person’s commitment and the person’s environment. Functional visual assessment is the basis of every programme planning and <b>low</b> vision <b>training,</b> since its results show the visual skill a person has already developed and provide us with insight into their use of visual skills in their everyday situations. <b>Low</b> vision <b>training</b> differentiates with the age of participants and with the type of low vision whereas the possibility of a multiple disability is also considered.

The paper proposes the improvement of these models by considering an enhanced catenary stiffness model and contact modelling based on lagrangian multipliers.

The results show that catenary stiffness modelling plays a central role at <b>low</b> <b>train</b> speed.

Today the ticketing network is computerised to a large extent, with the exception of some remote places. Computerized tickets can be booked for any two points in the country. Tickets can also be booked through the internet and via mobile phones, though this method carries an additional surcharge.|$|R
