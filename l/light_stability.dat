40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on anthocyanin extraction from red cabbage using water as a solvent. Mashed cabbage was placed in a batch treatment chamber and subjected to PEF (2. 5 kV/cm electric field strength; 15 μs pulse width and 50 pulses, specific energy 15. 63 J/g). Extracted anthocyanin concentrations (16 to 889 μg/mL) were determined using HPLC. Heat and <b>light</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the control and PEF-treated samples, having approximately the same initial concentrations, were studied. PEF treatments enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from red cabbage by 2. 15 times with a higher proportion of nonacylated forms than the control (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The heat and <b>light</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the PEF-treated samples and control samples were not significantly different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Practical Application: An innovative pretreatment technology, pulsed electric field processing, enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from red cabbage by 2. 15 times. Manufacturers of natural colors can use this technology to extract anthocyanins from red cabbage efficiently...|$|R

However most of synthesis (or deposition) methods hardly avoid high temperature process, especially for crystalline structured thin films. A novel deposition process for nano-crystal embedded polymorphous silicon (nc-embedded pm-Si) thin films {{at room temperature}} has been developed by adopting the neutral beam assisted chemical vapor deposition (NBaCVD).

5000|$|In {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} (GF) polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) and 66 (Nylon 66) formulations {{as well as}} in polyesters like polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and PET, aluminium diethyl phosphinate shows excellent performance in the UL 94 flammability tests [...] (UL 94 V0 specification is met down to 0.4 mm), {{as well as in}} the glow wire tests required for appliances. Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire ignition test (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the glow wire flammability test (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good <b>light</b> <b>stability</b> which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{different}} nitrogen sources on the yield, distribution and photostability of monascus pigments was detected in liquid fermentation. Compared to the control, glutamic and 6 -furturylaminopurine {{could increase the}} production of pigments from 4185 to 4303 and 4349 U g− 1 for different mechanism.

The system has two parts: 1) it learns predictable sunlight patterns due to trees, nearby buildings, or other environmental factors, and 2) it controls the window transparency based on a quadratic optimization over predicted sunlight levels. To evaluate the system, we record daylight levels at 39 different windows for up to 12 weeks at a time, and apply our control algorithm on the data traces. Our results indicate that SunCast can reduce glare by over 59 % over a baseline approach with only a marginal increase in artificial lighting energy.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{colorants}} based on renewable resources and food-grade colorants {{have been evaluated}} for use in polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC). It {{has been found that}} most of these colorants can be processed in PP at 200 degreesC or even 260 degreesC while maintaining good color intensity and color brightness. The colorants evaluated cover {{a large part of the}} color spectrum. In PP, the <b>light</b> <b>stability</b> of alizarin (red), carmine (red), indigo (blue), purpurin (red), quinizarin (red), and the aluminium lakes of quinoline yellow (yellow) and indigo carmine (blue) is close to the requirements for indoor applications. The blue colorants indigo and the aluminium lake of indigo carmine are, in principle, sufficiently light stable in PP for indoor applications. A few colorants showed bleeding from PP. Bonding of migrating colorants to the reactive carrier maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene, however, reduced bleeding of the colorant to a large extent. Also after processing in PVC at 200 degreesC, good color intensity and saturation is maintained. Quinizarin, a structural analog of alizarin and purpurin, shows a <b>light</b> <b>stability</b> performance that is close to commercial lead chromate/molybdate orange based colorants. The best performing natural colorants are sufficiently heat and light stable for applications where moderate properties concerning heat resistance and (UV) <b>light</b> <b>stability</b> are required, such as underground PVC water drainage pipes and indoor PP applications.
