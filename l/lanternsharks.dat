5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18â€“25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes <b>lanternsharks,</b> squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} smooth <b>lanternsharks,</b> {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth <b>lanternsharks</b> are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|E
500|$|The {{velvet belly}} lanternshark (or simply velvet belly) (Etmopterus spinax) is {{a species of}} dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae. One {{of the most common}} {{deepwater}} sharks in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the velvet belly is found from Iceland and Norway to Gabon and South Africa at a depth of [...] A small shark generally no more than [...] long, the velvet belly is so named because its black underside is abruptly distinct from the brown coloration on the rest of its body. The body of this species is fairly stout, with a moderately long snout and tail, and very small gill slits. Like other <b>lanternsharks,</b> the velvet belly is bioluminescent, with light-emitting photophores forming a species-specific pattern over its flanks and abdomen. The ventral photophores are thought to function in counter-illumination, which camouflages the shark against predators and prey. The bioluminescent flank markings {{may play a role in}} intraspecific communication.|$|E

Of the 16 hermaphrodites examined, 15 were functional females (and some were pregnant) that also possessed well-developed claspers (male intromittent organs), while one was a functional male with ovarian tissue in the left testis. The reason why so many sharks in Suruga Bay are hermaphroditic is unclear, but has been speculated to relate to pollution.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps the {{smallest}} living shark species, male dwarf <b>lanternsharks</b> mature at {{a length of}} [...] and females from a length of [...] with [...] long pregnant individuals known. The spined pygmy shark (Squaliolus laticaudus) and the pygmy ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis radcliffei) are known to attain maturity at comparably small sizes; difficulties in assessing the reproductive maturity of sharks precludes stating one of these species as definitively smaller than the others.

2500|$|The dermal {{denticle}}s of this shark {{are tiny}} and densely placed with no regular pattern; each denticle has a four-cornered base and rises to a narrow, slightly curved point. The denticles of females are firmly attached, while those of males are easily removed. The coloration is a plain dark gray or brown, slightly darker below and lighter on the dorsal fin margins. Unlike other <b>lanternsharks,</b> {{there is a}} not a sharp contrast between the dorsal and ventral colors. There is a horizontal black line {{on the base of}} the tail, and another fainter black mark over the pelvic fins. The maximum reported length is [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E
2500|$|The brown lanternshark or {{bristled}} lanternshark (Etmopterus unicolor) is {{a little-known}} species of deep-sea dogfish shark {{in the family}} Etmopteridae.
