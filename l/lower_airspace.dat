50|$|Other {{controlled}} airspace is designated as Class E, this includes {{a large part}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace.</b> Class E airspace exists in many forms. It can serve as a surface-based extension to Class D airspace to accommodate IFR approach/departure procedure areas. Class E airspace can be designated to have a floor of 700' AGL or 1,200' AGL, or a customized floor of any other altitude. Class E airspace exists above Class G surface areas from 14,500' MSL to 18,000 MSL. Federal airways from 1,200 AGL to 18,000 MSL within 4 mi of the centerline of the airway is designated Class E airspace. Airspace at any altitude over 60,000' (the ceiling of Class A airspace) is designated Class E airspace.|$|E

We only focus on horizontal maneuvers in order not to interfere with aircraft TCAS. The article investigates the influence of the various parameters on the separation achieved. The analysis of results from over 200 000 simulations provides minimum requirements on the frequency and anticipation time of the resolution process for an efficient detect and avoid strategy and brings up remaining issues in scenarios where the UAV has a low maneuverability and encounters fast airliners with changing speed and heading...|$|E

Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was proposed to be a guardian of basal barrier function, since eNOS knock-out mice display an impaired expression of inter-endothelial junction proteins and as such an increased vascular permeability, as compared to wild type mice. The enzyme arginase, the activity of which can be regulated by the redox status of the cell, exists in two isoforms - arginase 1 (cytosolic) and arginase 2 (mitochondrial) - both of which can be expressed in lung microvascular endothelial cells. Upon activation, arginase competes with eNOS for the substrate L-arginine, as such impairing eNOS-dependent NO generation and promoting ROS generation by the enzyme. This mini-review will discuss recent findings regarding the interaction between bacterial toxins and arginase during acute lung injury and will as such address the role of arginase in bacterial toxin-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Over the {{duration}} of the last year research regarding the en route delay absorption capabilities of the MUAC airspace for Schiphol inbound flights has been performed. Delay absorption currently takes place in the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace,</b> where as a result air traffic controllers and pilots experience increased workloads during {{one of the most critical}} periods of a flight. This in combination with the expected fuel inefficiency of delay absorption in the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace</b> resulted in this research to investigate the options of moving delay absorption away from the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace,</b> into the en route airspace. The MUAC airspace is all airspace above FL 245 over The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and West-Germany, encompassing Schiphol inbound flights entering the LVNL airspace (all airspace over The Netherlands up to FL 245) from the South, East and North. Traffic data from two sample days was selected (one in high season and one in low season) to reflect the different traffic patterns occuring throughout the year, based on which the planning conflicts were determined. From these planning conflicts the amount of required delay absorption has been obtained, and used as an input to determine which way of en route delay absorption should be used. A range of delay absorption measures has been defined and evaluated: linear holding and dropping for all routes, and detouring and turtling for selected Northern routes. Linear holding means only slowing an aircraft down to the Maximum Range Cruise speed at most, and dropping represents both slowing an aircraft down while lowering its altitude by 2000 ft across its trajectory within the MUAC airspace. Detouring and turtling are the equivalent of linear holding and dropping, respectively, however executed on an extended trajectory. Changing the trajectory of an aircraft may result in conflicts with other traffic, hence it was decided only to use these measures for the Northern routes. This part of the MUAC airspace has a lower traffic density in general, and was the only airspace that could reasonably be provided with detours. The changes were implemented in the scenarios, which were run in the BlueSky Open Source ATM Simulator to gather data on fuel consumption (using Eurocontrol’s Base of Aircraft Data), air traffic controller communications workload, and the number of conflicts with other traffic. The data obtained from the delayed scenarios has been compared to the original scenario to see how the variables were affected by the delay absorption. The delay absorption within the MUAC airspace was found to be 0. 4 s/NM for linear holding and 0. 7 s/NM for dropping. For the three routes through the Jever sector that were found eligible for detouring and turtling, an additional 8 seconds should be counted for each additionally flown nautical mile. Fuel consumption has been compared to the fuel consumption in the original scenario, from which a slightly reduced fuel consumption was found for linear holding (- 0. 1 %), but a significantly lower fuel consumption for dropping and turtling (- 45 % and - 50 %, respectively). This strong reduction in fuel consumption is caused by the earlier initiated descent, during which the aircraft can throttle back to idle thrust. Detouring was found unfavourable in terms of fuel (due to the additional path length), but is nevertheless an effective means of delay absorption. The communication workload was generally found to strongly increase during MUAC peak loadings. Adding more work when a controller is already at his/her busiest is not very desirable, which is why it is unlikely that delay absorption during peak loading can be implemented in the way it was simulated. However, off-peak workloads were sometimes found to be even lower than in the original scenario. This can be explained by the reduction of the number of conflicts, due to which some of the workload assigned for resolving conflicts could be eliminated. During these times of day en route delay absorption would be more than just feasible; it would be very desirable. The ability to predict the change in communication workload has been assessed by computing the correlation between expected and actual change in communication workload, as well as between traffic density and actual change in communication workload, but no relation was found to be strong enough to give a representative indication of the actual change in workload. Overall, the total number of conflicts during linear holding and dropping runs for the low season day were found to lower by 1. 1 % and 0. 4 % respectively. The high season saw an overall increase of 0. 7 % of the total number of conflicts. It is thus expected to be favourable for other traffic if en route delay absorption is performed during low season days, but mostly unfavourable during high season. The Jever sector was the only sector to be equipped with detouring and turtling options, and during all scenarios except for the August linear holding and dropping scenarios a reduction of the total number of conflicts was observed. It can be concluded that when care is taken in when and how en route delay absorption is implemented, it most definitely shows potential to (partially) replace delay methods in the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace.</b> Control & Operations - ATM, Airports & SafetyAerospace Design, Integration & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In years past, {{society has}} {{typically}} associated the word “drone” with the War on Terror and far-off battlefields. With {{the advent of}} the smart phone revolution, however, the once prohibitive costs of the technology have decreased to a level the general public can afford. As a consequence, a rising number of entrepreneurs associate the word “drone” with opportunity—a means of reaching a new commercial frontier, provided they can get off the ground. Purportedly {{due to the lack of}} a regulatory framework governing the new technology, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has essentially prohibited the use of drones at any altitude for “business purposes. ” With the prohibition likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future, many of these would-be entrepreneurs choose to fly in open defiance of the FAA. Some of these drone pilots challenge whether the FAA even possesses the authority to impose the prohibition. The FAA responds to these challenges by insisting that it alone has the power to regulate the safety of all airspace “from the ground up. ” While the U. S. Supreme Court has held that landowners retain a right to own the “superadjacent” airspace above their property, the Court has left undefined the precise limits of superadjacent airspace. However, utilizing drones provides an opportunity to define “superadjacent” and, more importantly, establish the outer limits of the FAA’s authority over the <b>lower</b> <b>airspace.</b> This Note argues that the FAA’s broad interpretation of its authority cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court decisions regarding landowners’ rights to own airspace above their property. This Note concludes that given the Supreme Court precedent, the FAA’s blanket prohibition on the use of drones for “business purposes” is an invalid exercise of its authority...|$|E

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper, we introduced the Chemistry of Atmosphere-Forest Exchange (CAFE) model, a vertically-resolved 1 -D chemical transport model designed {{to probe the}} details of near-surface reactive gas exchange. Here, we apply CAFE to noontime observations from the 2007 Biosphere Effects on Aerosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX- 2007). In this work we evaluate the CAFE modeling approach, demonstrate the significance of in-canopy chemistry for forest-atmosphere exchange and identify key shortcomings in the current understanding of intra-canopy processes. CAFE generally reproduces BEARPEX- 2007 observations but requires an enhanced radical recycling mechanism to overcome a factor of 6 underestimate of hydroxyl (OH) concentrations observed during a warm (~ 29 °C) period. Modeled fluxes of acyl peroxy nitrates (APN) are quite sensitive to gradients in chemical production and loss, demonstrating that chemistry may perturb forest-atmosphere exchange even when the chemical timescale is long relative to the canopy mixing timescale. The model underestimates peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) fluxes by 50 % and the exchange velocity by nearly a factor of three under warmer conditions, suggesting that near-surface APN sinks are underestimated relative to the sources. Nitric acid typically dominates gross dry N deposition at this site, though other reactive nitrogen (NOy) species can comprise up to 28 % of the N deposition budget under cooler conditions. Upward NO 2 fluxes cause the net above-canopy NOy flux to be ~ 30 % lower than the gross depositional flux. CAFE under-predicts ozone fluxes and exchange velocities by ~ 20 %. Large uncertainty in the parameterization of cuticular and ground deposition precludes conclusive attribution of non-stomatal fluxes to chemistry or surface uptake. Model-measurement comparisons of vertical concentration gradients for several emitted species suggests that the <b>lower</b> canopy <b>airspace</b> may be only weakly coupled with the upper canopy. Future efforts to model forest-atmosphere exchange will require a more mechanistic understanding of non-stomatal deposition and a more thorough characterization of in-canopy mixing processes...|$|R
