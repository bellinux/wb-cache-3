5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
25|$|Zoos {{worldwide}} have {{a population}} of 550 western lowland gorillas, and the Cincinnati Zoo leads the United States in western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> births.|$|E
25|$|Disease {{has also}} been a factor in the {{survival}} of the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla.</b> The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two epizootics infected the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla,</b> which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by Magdalena Bermejo and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat. The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> a critically endangered species. Malaria is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have Plasmodium DNA. Laverania, which is a sub-genus of the Plasmodium genus of parasitic protozoa, was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting Plasmodium species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, in 2013, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to better understand the genetic variation in gorillas by using reduced representation sequencing. This study consisted of a sample of 12 western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> and two eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> all in captivity. The study found that western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> {{are more likely to be}} heterozygous than homozygous. Most pure (meaning they are not inbred) western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> have a hom/het ratio that ranges from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, because of variation in these gorillas, it has been concluded that they display a moderate substructure within the western lowland population in general.|$|R
2500|$|Eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> {{have more}} diverse diets, which vary seasonally. Leaves and pith are {{commonly}} eaten, but fruits {{can make up}} as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less available, <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from 2.7–6.5km2 (1.04 to 2.51mi2), with day ranges [...] Eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> will also eat insects, preferably ants. Western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> depend on fruits more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range. They travel even further than the other gorilla subspecies, at [...] per day on average, and have larger home ranges of 7–14km2 (2.70–5.41mi2). Western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> have less access to terrestrial herbs, although they can access aquatic herbs in some areas. Termites and ants are also eaten.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{the study}} sought out {{to analyze the}} allele {{frequency}} spectrum (AFS) in western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas.</b> The reason why is that AFS knowledge can help give information regarding demographics and evolutionary processes. The AFS has determined that western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> display a deficit of rare alleles.|$|R
25|$|It is {{the only}} gorilla kept in zoos with the {{exception}} of Amahoro, a female Eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> at Antwerp Zoo and a few Mountain gorillas kept captive in Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
25|$|Bush meat {{hunting and}} timber {{harvesting}} {{in the western}} lowland gorilla’s habitat have negatively affected the probability of its survival. The western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{is considered to be}} critically endangered by the IUCN. The western lowland gorillas, like many gorillas, are essential to the composition of the rainforest due to their seed distribution. The conservation of the Western <b>Lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> has been made a priority by many organizations. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been working with the local community in the Congo Basin to establish wildlife management programs. The WCS is also working in Congo and surrounding countries to limit the bush meat trade by enforcing laws and hunting restrictions and also helping the local people find new sources of protein.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of gorillas {{are the other}} two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has. Until recently, gorillas {{were considered to be}} a single species, with three subspecies: the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla,</b> the eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Gorillas' natural {{habitats}} cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa. Although their range covers {{a small percentage}} of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from [...] <b>Lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> living in Central West African countries and eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.|$|R
25|$|Studies of {{the mental}} {{capacity}} of western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> continue.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of the seeds in the diets of <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> seems {{to have some sort}} of medicinal properties for their cardiovascular health in the wild. As captive <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> have not had them usually available in their diets, it could be a cause of their occasionally poor cardiovascular health in zoos.|$|R
25|$|In September 2017, a {{replacement}} for Harambe was added, Mshindi, a 29-year-old western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> from the Louisville Zoo. He joined females Chewie, 21, and Mara, 22, who were present {{the day of the}} killing. At the same time, the zoo was creating a new indoor habitat where the public could view the gorillas year-round.|$|E
25|$|The western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) {{is one of}} two {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) that lives in montane, primary and secondary forests and lowland swamps in central Africa in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is the nominate subspecies of the western gorilla.|$|E
25|$|Goma was {{the first}} gorilla born in Europe (western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla,</b> the second {{worldwide}} in a zoo) and was raised by zoo officials. On May2, 1972 she and Jambo had the world's first second generation zoo offspring: Tamtam (who died in summer 2009). She is the oldest member of the gorilla group in Basel (May 2010) and celebrated her 50th birthday on September 23, 2009 with a large public birthday party.|$|E
40|$|The {{geographical}} distribution of genetic variation within western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) was examined {{to clarify the}} population genetic structure and recent evolutionary history of this group. DNA was amplified from shed hair collected from sites across {{the range of the}} three traditionally recognized <b>gorilla</b> subspecies: western <b>lowland</b> (G. g. <b>gorilla),</b> eastern <b>lowland</b> (G. g. graueri) and mountain (G. g. beringei) gorillas. Nucleotide sequence variation was examined in the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region and was much higher in western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> than in either of the other two subspecies. In addition to recapitulating the major evolutionary split between eastern and western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas,</b> phylogenetic analysis indicates a phylogeographical division within western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas,</b> one haplogroup comprising gorilla populations from eastern Nigeria through to southeast Cameroon and a second comprising all other western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Within this second haplogroup, haplotypes appear to be partitioned geographically into three subgroups: (i) Equatorial Guinea, (ii) Central African Republic, and (iii) Gabon and adjacent Congo. There is also evidence of limited haplotype admixture in northeastern Gabon and southeast Cameroon. The phylogeographical patterns are broadly consistent with those predicted by current Pleistocene refuge hypotheses for the region and suggest that historical events have {{played an important role in}} shaping the population structure of this subspecies...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{the largest}} of the four gorilla subspecies. It has jet black coats like the {{mountain}} gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the hair is shorter on the head and body. The male's coat, like that of other gorillas, turns silver at the back as the animal matures. There are many more western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> than the eastern variety; compared to over 100,000 western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas,</b> there were only about 5,000 eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> in the wild in a 2004 report and fewer than 3,800 in a 2016 one.

25|$|The {{eastern gorilla}} is more darkly {{coloured}} than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla {{also has the}} thickest hair. The western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla.|$|E
25|$|The western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla,</b> chimpanzee, black colobus, {{mandrill}} {{and golden}} potto {{have all been}} listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and water chevrotain. The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
25|$|Western lowland gorillas {{primarily}} live in rain forests, swamp forest, brush, secondary vegetation, {{clearing and}} forest edges, abandoned farming fields and riverine forests. They live in {{primary and secondary}} lowland tropical forests that have elevations that extend from sea level up to 1,300 meters. The average amount of rainfall in the areas where western lowland gorillas typically reside is about 1,500 millimetres a year with the greatest rainfall between the months of August and November. Western lowland gorillas are not typically observed {{in areas that are}} close to human settlements and villages. They have been known to avoid areas with roads and farms that show signs of human activity. These gorillas favor areas where edible plants are more copious. Swamp forests are now considered important feeding areas and habitats for the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla.</b> These areas support the gorillas in both the wet and the dry season of the forest. The forests of the Republic of Congo are currently considered to host the majority of the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> population. The forests of the Republic of Congo serve as protection to the gorillas with the isolation of the large swampy forest areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of western lowland gorillas has allowed humans {{to further the}} study of how gorillas compare with humans in regards to human diseases, behavior, linguistic and psychological aspects of their lives. They are hunted illegally for their skins and meat in Africa and captured {{to be sold to}} zoos. While defended as being economically profitable for restaurants and local people, it is a large contributor to the endangered status of the western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla.</b> They are also seen as a crop pest in western Africa because they raid native plantations and therefore destroy what would have otherwise been valuable crops.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2016, {{a three-year-old}} boy climbed into a gorilla {{enclosure}} at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla.</b> Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker {{shot and killed}} Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo {{had no other choice}} under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.|$|E
25|$|Jambo was {{a western}} <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> born in Basel. He became a celebrity {{sensation}} at the Jersey Zoo where on August31, 1986 he cared for a 5-year-old boy who {{fell into the}} gorilla habitat. A video of the fall is on YouTube and was watched nearly 700,000 times before it was deleted in September 2009 and relisted. Two new movies of this event have been watched over 280,000 times combined (May 2010). After Jambo died in 1992, a bronze statue in his memory erected at the zoo and Gerald Durrell produced a video documentary called Jambo — the Gentle Giant.

25|$|In the past, {{there was}} a gorilla that used a stick to measure how deep water was.

Most notably, an {{experiment}} was conducted at Buffalo Zoological Gardens from 17 April 2010 to 26 June 2010 relating to this incident. The experiment involved one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas given five gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger female gorillas were able to successfully fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos. What should be worth noting is that {{the environment of the}} zoo may affect the behavior of the gorillas.|$|E
25|$|The {{only known}} albino gorilla – named Snowflake – was a wild-born western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{originally}} from Equatorial Guinea. Snowflake, a male gorilla, {{was taken from}} the wild and brought to the Barcelona Zoo in 1966 at a very young age. Snowflake presented the typical traits and characteristics of albinism typically seen in humans, including white hair, pinkish skin, light colored eyes, reduced visual perception and photophobia (discomfort in bright light). Snowflake was diagnosed by scientists as having non-syndromic albinism. The genetic variant for Snowflake’s albinism was identified by the scientists as a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is also known to be involved in oculocutaneous albinism type 4 in humans. This information revealed the first evidence of inbreeding in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
25|$|The western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{population}} in the wild is faced {{by a number of}} factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting. Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age. The fecundity of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.|$|E

50|$|A gorilla's day is synchronized, {{divided between}} rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit makes {{up a very}} small part of their diets. Mountain gorilla food is widely {{distributed}} and neither individuals nor groups {{have to compete with}} one another. Their home ranges average 3-15 km2 (1.16-5.79 mi2), and their movements range around 500 m or less on an average day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.Eastern <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> have more diverse diets, which vary seasonally. Leaves and pith are commonly eaten, but fruits can make up as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less available, <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from 2.7-6.5 km2 (1.04 to 2.51 mi2), with day ranges 154 - 2280 m.

40|$|International audienceThe most {{important}} environmental factor explaining interspecies variation in ecology and sociality {{of the great}} apes {{is likely to be}} variation in resource availability. Relatively {{little is known about the}} activity patterns of western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), which inhabit a dramatically different environment from the well-studied mountain gorillas (G. beringei beringei). This study aims to provide a detailed quantification of western lowland gorillas' activity budgets using direct observations on one habituated group in Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We examined how activity patterns of both sexes are shaped by seasonal frugivory. Activity was recorded with 5 -min instantaneous sampling between December 2004 and December 2005. During the high-frugivory period the gorillas spent less time feeding and more time traveling than during the low-frugivory period. The silverback spent less time feeding but more time resting than both females and immatures, which likely results from a combination of social and physiological factors. When compared with mountain <b>gorillas,</b> western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> spend more time feeding (67 vs. 55 %) and traveling (12 vs. 6. 5 %), but less time resting (21 vs. 34 %) and engaging in social/other activities (0. 5 vs. 3. 6 %). This disparity in activity budgets of western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> and mountain gorillas may be explained by the more frugivorous diet and the greater dispersion of food resources experienced by western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Like other apes, western <b>lowland</b> <b>gorillas</b> change their activity patterns in response to changes in the diet...|$|R
