25|$|Usually {{the chair}} was {{fastened}} to a long wooden beam fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the victim died.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{she went}} as usual to her holiday home on Belle-ÃŽle {{with her family}} and close friends. There, she {{received}} {{the news of the}} assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{and the beginning of the}} First World War. She hurried back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that gangrene had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a palanquin she designed, supported by two <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the Lous XV style, with white sides and gilded trim.|$|E
500|$|Magma {{reached the}} surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, {{resulting}} in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome's south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as a lava spine nicknamed the [...] "whaleback," [...] which comprised <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.|$|E

2500|$|Exhaust steam {{leaving the}} {{reciprocating}} engines was {{fed into the}} turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a surface condenser, {{to increase the efficiency}} of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused. The engines were attached directly to <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of [...] The middle propeller was slightly smaller at [...] in diameter, and could be stopped but not reversed.|$|E
2500|$|The G.I was a two bay triplane, the bays {{separated}} by parallel pairs of interplane struts. [...] The wings were unswept and had constant chord and blunt tips. [...] The upper span was {{significantly greater than}} that of the lower wing, so its tips were supported by extra, outward leaning parallel pairs of struts; there was little stagger. Only the upper wing carried ailerons, which had trailing edges projecting behind that of the wing. [...] The ailerons were operated by wires from the ends of long levers, each projecting above and below the wing. [...] The [...] Mercedes D.III six cylinder inline engines were mounted on the lower wing's upper surface in the inner bay and largely uncowled. [...] These drove pusher configuration propellers beyond the trailing edge via <b>long</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then Bob {{took his}} trick at the wheel, Jim camping {{down on the}} deck in the place so lately vacated by the old sailor; and when {{his eyes were closed}} in slumber he did not open them again until the sun began to send <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of golden light across the leaping waters.|$|E

60|$|Now we three lay {{where could}} be had {{a view of}} all our surroundings, and during the next hour, {{at the end of}} which time the sun was sending <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of light through the {{openings}} in the forest, we succeeded in sending five of the scoundrels to their happy hunting-grounds, or back under cover disabled by serious wounds.|$|E
60|$|The <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> {{began to}} fly again, raining alike upon the slaughterers and the slaughtered. A few minutes, five perhaps, and this terrible scene was over, for {{of the seven}} {{thousand}} Genoese but a tithe remained upon their feet, and the interminable French lines, clad in sparkling steel and waving lance and sword, charged down upon the little English band.|$|E
60|$|The Army of Glinda the Good {{looked very}} grand and {{imposing}} when it assembled at daybreak before the palace gates. The uniforms {{of the girl}} soldiers were pretty and of gay colors, and their silver-tipped spears were bright and glistening, the <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> being inlaid with mother-of-pearl. All the officers wore sharp, gleaming swords, and shields edged with peacock-feathers; and it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army.|$|E

60|$|Then, as the <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> smote {{the swaying}} bridge, he lightly crossed it, and beckoned us to follow. We obeyed, {{and in another}} instant all was again darkness.|$|R
60|$|A shaggy Indian pony came ambling {{around the}} corner between the <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of a charette. A bareheaded young man in tow shirt and {{trousers}} was driving, and three laughing girls were seated on the stools in the cart behind him. Suddenly, before I quite realized what had happened, the young man pulled up the pony, the girls fell silent, and Nick {{was standing in the}} middle of the road, with his hat in his hand, bowing elaborately.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} with a sigh. The sun was shining brilliantly outside. Through the half-open blinds its <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> seemed to be searching {{the house for the}} lost guests, and making the hollow shell appear doubly empty. What a {{contrast}} to the dear dark days of mysterious seclusion and delicious security, lit by Lee's laughter and the sparkling hearth, which had passed so quickly! The forgotten outer world seemed to have returned to the house through those open windows and awakened its dwellers from a dream.|$|E
60|$|Ellen bent swift {{steps toward}} her camp. <b>Long</b> <b>shafts</b> of gold preceded {{her through the}} forest. Then they paled and vanished. The tips of pines and spruces turned gold. A hoarse-voiced old turkey gobbler was booming his chug-a-lug from the highest ground, and the softer chick of hen turkeys {{answered}} him. Ellen was almost breathless when she arrived. Two packs {{and a couple of}} lop-eared burros attested to the fact of Antonio's return. This was good news for Ellen. She heard the bleat of lambs and tinkle of bells coming nearer and nearer. And she was glad to feel that if Isbel had visited her camp, most probably it was during the absence of the herders.|$|E

Mayhap, after all, I should have done well to take yonder Murgh for lord when I had the chance. Man, or god, or ghost, he's a fellow to my liking, and once he had led me through the Gates no woman would have dared to come to part us. Well, good-bye, Hugh de Cressi, till you are sick of kisses and the <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> begin to fly again, for then you will bethink you of a certain bow and of him who alone can bend it." ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{stopping}} to dispute either Master Saxon's judgment {{or that of}} Wessenburg of the Pandours, I proposed that we should order an evening meal, and should employ the remaining hour or two of daylight in looking over the city. The principal sight is of course the noble cathedral, which is built in such exact proportion that one would fail to understand its great size did one not actually enter it and pace round the long dim aisles. So solemn were its sweeping arches and the <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of coloured light which shone through the stained-glass windows, throwing strange shadows amongst the pillars, that even my companion, albeit not readily impressed, was silent and subdued. It was a great prayer in stone.|$|E
60|$|We {{spent an}} {{impressive}} {{hour in the}} noble cathedral, where <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty windows and falling on a pillar here, a picture there, and a kneeling worshiper yonder. The organ was muttering, censers were swinging, candles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing silently past them; the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts away and steep the soul in a holy calm. A trim young American lady paused a yard or two from me, fixed {{her eyes on the}} mellow sparks flecking the far-off altar, bent her head reverently a moment, then straightened up, kicked her train into the air with her heel, caught it deftly in her hand, and marched briskly out.|$|E

60|$|Still gliding onward, Hilda now {{looked up}} into the dome, where the {{sunshine}} came through the western windows, and threw across <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of light. They rested upon the mosaic figures of two evangelists above the cornice. These great beams of radiance, traversing what seemed the empty space, were made visible in misty glory, by the holy cloud of incense, else unseen, which had risen into the middle dome. It was to Hilda as if she beheld the worship of the priest and people ascending heavenward, purified from its alloy of earth, and acquiring celestial substance in the golden atmosphere to which it aspired, She wondered if angels did not sometimes hover within the dome, and show themselves, in brief glimpses, floating amid the sunshine and the glorified vapor, to those who devoutly worshipped on the pavement.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We went down, so as {{to leave}} {{no part of the}} palace unexplored. The vaults were, it was believed, used as dungeons in the old times--say, some centuries since. Air and light were only {{partially}} admitted to these dismal places by two <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of winding construction, which communicated with the back yard of the palace, and the openings of which, high above the ground, were protected by iron gratings. The stone stairs leading down into the vaults could be closed at will by a heavy trap-door in the back hall, which we found open. The Baron himself led the way down the stairs. We remarked that it might be awkward if that trap-door fell down and closed the opening behind us. The Baron smiled at the idea. [...] "Don't be alarmed, gentlemen," [...] he said; [...] "the door is safe. I had an interest in seeing to it myself, when we first inhabited the palace. My favourite study is the study of experimental chemistry--and my workshop, since we have been in Venice, is down here." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{while after}} the San Antonio, two of whose masts were gone, {{tried to put}} about and run for Malaga, which they could see far away beneath the snow-capped {{mountains}} of the Sierra. But this the Spaniard could not do, for while she hung in the wind the Margaret came right atop of her, and as her men laboured at the sails, {{every one of the}} Englishmen who could be spared, under the command of Peter, let loose on them with their <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> and crossbows, and, though the heaving deck of the Margaret was no good platform, and the wind bent the arrows from their line, they killed and wounded eight or ten of them, causing them to loose the ropes so that the San Antonio swung round into the gale again. On the high tower of the caravel, his arm round the sternmost mast, stood d'Aguilar, shouting commands to his crew. Peter fitted an arrow to his string and, waiting until the Margaret was poised for a moment on the crest of a great sea, aimed and loosed, making allowance for the wind.|$|E
