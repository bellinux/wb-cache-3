Traditionally, ignition retard {{has been used to}} reduce <b>the</b> <b>light-off</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst.</b> This is however associated with a fuel penalty.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{technique to}} enhance fuel efficiency of large capacity S. I. engines is <b>the</b> de-activation <b>of</b> some cylinders at partial load, through <b>the</b> cut-out <b>of</b> fuel metering and a specific control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airflow. Thanks to <b>the</b> ensuing reduction <b>of</b> throttling losses (<b>the</b> active cylinders operate {{at a much}} higher load), fuel consumption can be reduced, without any negative perception from the driver. Such a technique has been already applied successfully on some production engines, at <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> some additional complication on the valve-train system. The application analyzed in this study is a little bit different, being aimed to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions, with a minimum impact on engine design. Larger fuel savings may be obtained by coupling the cylinder de-activation with VVT. However, the most important advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modular engine concept proposed in this paper is in terms of emissions: this study demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>light-off</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalysts</b> may be strongly reduced, and a further improvement is obtained by doubling <b>the</b> effective surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalytic bed. The study has been carried out on a conventional SI 4. 2 L V 8 engine. <b>The</b> first step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis has been <b>the</b> experimental validation <b>of</b> a 1 D-CFD model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine, achieved with a very good accuracy at both full and partial load.

These catalysts showed a definite activity for the selective oxidation propane to acrolein at 773 K, and <b>the</b> maximum yield <b>of</b> acrolein attained to 21. 9 % as <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> phosphorus equaled to 0. 15. <b>The</b> <b>catalysts</b> were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H- 2 -temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies. The experimental {{results revealed that}} <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> phosphorus not only change <b>the</b> crystalloid phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalysts</b> but also affect <b>the</b> redox capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalysts,</b> which greatly improved <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Oxidation of CO over Co 3 O 4 at ambient {{temperature}} was studied with flow reactor experiments, and in-situ spectroscopic and structural methods. <b>The</b> <b>catalyst</b> deactivates during <b>the</b> reaction. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> deactivation increased with increasing CO or CO 2 gas-phase concentration but decreased with increased 02 concentration or increased temperature. Regeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> in 10 % O- 2 /Ar was more efficient than regeneration in Ar alone. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> carbonates and surface carbon on <b>the</b> deactivated <b>catalyst</b> was concluded from TPO experiments. None of these species could, however, be correlated with <b>the</b> deactivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst.</b> In-situ FTIR showed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> surface carbonates, carbonyl, and oxygen species. The change in structure and oxidation state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> was studied by in-situ XRD, in-situ XANES, XPS, and flow reactor experiments. One possible explanation for <b>the</b> deactivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalyst</b> is a surface reconstruction hindering <b>the</b> redox cycle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction...|$|R
