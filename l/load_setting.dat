We address the issues of vessel allocation to the terminal (thus affecting the overall berth utilization), choice of planning time window (how long to plan ahead in the dynamic environment), and the choice of objective used in the berthing algorithm (e. g., should we focus on minimizing vessels ’ waiting time or maximizing berth utilization?).

METHODS We used {{data from the}} Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) collaboration, restricted to those infected since 1996, aged ≥ 15 years, and applied mixed effects models for CD 4 cell count decline and median regression for viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point (mean level 6 - 24 months from seroconversion). RESULTS The analysis included 3364 seroconverters with known HIV- 1 subtypes. Compared with subtype B, CD 4 at seroconversion was significantly higher for subtype CRF 01 and lower for subtype C. Subsequent CD 4 decline was significantly slower for subtypes A and CRF 02 and marginally slower for subtype C compared with B. Mean CD 4 loss at 2 years of seroconversion for white men exposed through sex between men, aged 30 - 39 years, having seroconverted since 2006, enrolled within 6 months of seroconversion, and without acute infection was 88, 142, 100, 130, 103, and 167 cells/µL for subtypes A, B, C, CRF 01 _AE, CRF 02 _AG, and G, respectively.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression. Methods. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from 49 women 6, 17, 30, and 55 weeks after HIV- 1 infection and from 22 of these women before infection. Associations between genital inflammation and viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point and blood CD 4 cell counts 12 months after infection were investigated. Results. Elevated genital cytokine concentrations 6 and 17 weeks after HIV- 1 infection were associated with higher viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> points and, to a lesser extent, with CD 4 depletion. CVL cytokine concentrations during early infection did not differ relative to preinfection but were elevated in women who had vaginal discharge, detectable HIV- 1 RNA in their genital tracts, and lower blood CD 4 counts.

Taking training environment in snow and cold prone areas into consideration, the condition that the test should be carried out on an indoor course （ 250 meters or less) was imposed. The running test which took running distance within the given time was carried out two times (including a 30 -second intermission) in order to measure its total running distance, which gives an estimate of the record at actual race. In the trial test whose total running time was set at 50 seconds, three kinds of conditions that a runner should run within different time at each trial test were established. As a result, a correlation was found only between the total running distance within " 25 s＋ 25 s" and the record at a 400 -meter race, and the regression line formula "Record at a 400 -meter race= - 0. 052 x+ 71. 840 （seconds）" was established.

40|$|The pressure-density {{relationship}} {{and the pressure}} distribution inside the compression chamber of a newly designed New Holland BB 960 large square baler were studied for the baling of alfalfa, whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw. An analytical model was developed for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the large square baler in the x-, y-, and z-directions by assuming isotropic linear elastic properties for forage materials. In order to validate this model, a tri-axial sensor was designed and {{used to measure the}} forces inside the compression chamber when whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw were baled. The experimental results proved that the developed analytical model for each of the tested forage materials had a good correlation with the experimental data with a reasonable coefficient of determination (0. 95) and standard error (20. 0 kPa). Test data were also used to develop an empirical model for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the baler for each of the tested forage materials using least square method in regression analysis. These empirical models were simple equations which were only functions of the distance from the full extension point of the plunger along the compression chamber length. Analytical and empirical models were also developed for the pressure-density relationship of the baler for baling alfalfa and barley straw. Results showed that bale density initially decreased with distance from the plunger, and then remained almost constant up {{to the end of the}} compression chamber. The developed empirical model for both alfalfa and barley straw was a combination of a quadratic and an exponential equation. In order to validate the developed models, field tests were performed by baling alfalfa and barley straw of different moisture contents, flake sizes, and load settings. The forces on the plunger arms were recorded by a data acquisition system. The actual bale bulk density was calculated by measuring the bale dimensions and weight. Results showed that both <b>load</b> <b>setting</b> and flake size had a significant effect on the plunger force. The plunger force increased with increased <b>load</b> <b>setting</b> and flake size. Comparing analytical and empirical models for bale density as a function of the pressure on the plunger showed that the trend of variation of density with pressure in both models was similar, but the rate of change was different. The variation rate of density with pressure in the analytical model was higher than that of the empirical model. The analytical model underestimated the bale density at low plunger pressures but showed more accurate prediction at higher pressures, while the empirical model accurately predicted the bale density at both low and high pressures. Some crop properties such as coefficient of friction and modulus of elasticity were determined for the development of the pressure distribution model. Results showed that static coefficient of friction of alfalfa on a polished steel surface was a quadratic function of material moisture content, while the relationship between the coefficient of friction of barley straw on a polished steel surface and material moisture content was best expressed by a linear equation. Results of this study also proved that modulus of elasticity of alfalfa and barley straw was constant for the density range encountered in the large square baler...|$|E
40|$|Introduction - A {{stationary}} start modification to the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) {{has become}} increasingly common. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the traditional 85 g kg − 1 body weight (BW) load (TRAD), or an individualized optimal load (OPT), is more suitable for obtaining peak and mean power outputs (PPO and MPO, respectively) for a stationary start. Methods - Twelve recreationally active males and 10 females (mean age 30 ± 9. 1 and 25 ± 5. 5 years, respectively) completed three trials. The first determined the OPT load and included a familiarization of the 30 -s stationary start test, followed by two randomized sessions testing the OPT and TRAD loads during the 30 -s stationary start test on separate days. For each test, measures of power (watts), time, and cadence were collected to determine PPO, MPO, rate of power decline (rPD) and time to peak power (TtPP). All power data were corrected for flywheel moment of inertia. Results - Results revealed significant differences between OPT and TRAD load settings for males (95. 1 ± 10. 7 and 85. 06 ± 0. 40 g kg − 1 BW; p = 0. 008) but not for females (84. 71 ± 8. 72 and 85. 2 ± 0. 61 g kg − 1 BW; p = 0. 813). Relative PPO was not different for OPT or TRAD loads for males (p = 0. 485) or females (p = 0. 488).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} {{a large number of}} design loads within the preliminary sizing process of aircraft structures in reasonable computational times, typically dynamic simulations are performed using simple stick models.

The combination of using the simple stick model as well as the conversion of the dynamic internal loads to static <b>load</b> <b>sets</b> leads to rather conservative designs.

It covers the topic of MILD {{combustion}} of liquid propane gas, G 25 natural gas, synthesis gas and landfill gas, of which the latter two represents low calorific gaseous fuels. The investigated engine was a C 9 G Stirling engine from Cleanergy. The primary incentive to {{this study was to}} determine if steady and reliable operation of the C 9 G Stirling engine could be maintained while using low calorific gaseous fuels. Another incentive to this project was to achieve further understanding of the combustion device, which purpose is to supply the Stirling engine with heat. Thus, an understanding of the changed characteristics caused by varying the air to fuel ratio was targeted. Engine operation by use of landfill gas, made up by 20 percent methane in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, was successful at the lowest <b>load</b> <b>setting</b> allowed by the C 9 G engine, generating 1 : 5 kW of shaft power. For liquid propane gas and G 25 natural gas, up to 10 : 9 kW of shaft power was generated. Combustion of synthesis gas was not attempted due to the hazard of carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by insufficient ventilation in the test cell. Apparent changes in energy ows and temperatures within the combustion device at varied air to fuel ratios suggest that incomplete combustion prior to the heat sink of the Stirling engine was an issue, especially at low to moderate air to fuel ratios. Further, a reversed ow direction through the ue gas recirculation cavities was observed when high ow rates of fuel, which primarily occurs for high load settings and low air to fuel ratios, was supplied to the engine. Consequently, a higher air to fuel ratio resulted in a higher system efficiency for all tested fuels and load settings. Thus, the system efficiency was concluded to be heavily impacted by the air to fuel ratio...|$|E

This research work involved the prediction of the fatigue life of an automotive rear suspension twistbeam assembly fitted to a vehicle travelling over a customer correlated durability route. This was achieved by making use of the integrated concepts of scaling and superposition of linear static finite element analysis being driven by experimental load data - the so called 'quasi-static time domain' approach. A study of the free body diagram of the twistbeam resulted in an indeterminate <b>load</b> <b>set</b> of some 24 components, with experimental data indicating that a state of static unbalance existed. Subsequent to developing a matrix-based generalised method ofload cell calibration to confum the foregoing, a modal technique was developed to partition the experimental data into a static <b>load</b> <b>set,</b> causing elastic deformations, and a rigid <b>load</b> <b>set,</b> imparting rigid body accelerations. The semi-independent characteristics of the twistbeam necessitated the coupling of large structural displacements with inertia relief. This required extensive modifications to the current techniques {{and led to the}} development and use of a three dimensional functional response matrix in place of the conventional two dimensional one. Recommendations concerning appropriate finite element boundary conditions were also formulated to handle these effects. Finally, the limitations of the uniaxial fatigue model were revealed under the application of a set of tools for analysing the biaxiality and mobility of the maximum absolute principal stress...|$|R
