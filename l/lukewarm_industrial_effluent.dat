40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{proposes to}} {{eliminate}} <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> from 27 outfalls at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The Proposed Action includes both simple and extensive plumbing modifications, which {{would result in}} the elimination of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> being released to the environment through 27 outfalls. The <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> currently going to about half of the 27 outfalls under consideration would be rerouted to LANL`s sanitary sewer system. <b>Industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> from other outfalls would be eliminated by replacing once-through cooling water systems with recirculation systems, or, in a few instances, operational changes would result in no generation of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent.</b> After the <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> have been discontinued, the affected outfalls would be removed from the NPDES Permit.

Several million metric tons <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> are produced in these establishments.

Modification of soil properties from industrial wastes causes foundation failures, structural damage in light industrial buildings on soil contaminated by various <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> have been reported. Hence safe disposal of wastes becomes a challenging task for geotechnical engineers in general and environmental engineers in particular. On the other hand in many situations, soils in its natural state do not present adequate geotechnical properties to be used as foundation layers and road service layers. These soils cause many problems in structures that come into their contact or constructed out of them. In order to suit their geotechnical parameters to meet the requirements of technical specifications of construction industry, studying soil stabilization is more emphasized.

Surface water, sediment, ground water and <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> samples were {{obtained}} bimonthly for 18 months (March 2005 to September 2006). Effluent characteristics varied widely with averages of DO (4. 25 ± 1. 3 mg/L), BOD (27. 5 ± 43 mg/L), Pb (0. 41 ± 0. 26 mg/L), Cr (0. 26 ± 0. 48 mg/L) and Ni (0. 19 ± 0. 14 mg/L). Average metal concentrations of surface water at effluent discharge point were: Pb (0. 065 ± 0. 065 mg/L), Cd (0. 012 ± 0. 023 mg/L), Cr (0. 11 ± 0. 23 mg/L) and Ni (0. 114 ± 0. 075 mg/L). Values decreased to Pb (0. 018 ± 0. 035 mg/L), Cd (0. 004 ± 0. 003 mg/L), Cr (0. 036 ± 0. 081 mg/L) and Ni (0. 025 ± 0. 023 mg/L) few kilometres downstream.

In response to <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents,</b> changes in ion distribution, concentration and pigment contents were found in wheat and faba bean plants. <b>Industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> induced an increase of pigment contents in wheat and decrease in faba bean. In all plant organs of wheat and faba bean, Zn concentration increased continuously with irrigation by <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents.</b> The increase in Zn concentration in wheat plants {{was found to be}} in the order root > leaf > stem.
