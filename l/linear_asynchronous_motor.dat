40|$|Usually, {{transportation}} of laminated products is done through rolls, {{put in rotation}} by electric motors. The acting moving force depends solely on the adherence of the laminated product to the moving rolls, which reduces {{the speed of the}} latter. The drawback of this speed limitation is most noticeable on the portions of the steel mill where, according to the work conditions, each metal sheet is to be rapidly stopped or pushed away (cutting zone, etc…). Since a large acceleration is not possible due to the resulting high inertial forces, a sliding of the bars on the rolls will occur.

If this <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> can be well understand {{and meet the}} requirements, it could be applied for several products.

Measurement setup is designed and made, including power electronic power supply for the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor.</b> The characteristics of the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> are measured. From the measurement results the most important problem is that the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> tends to run at lower speed with respect to the synchronous speed.
