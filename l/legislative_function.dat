5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{achieved}} city {{status in}} 1972, {{becoming the first}} settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory. Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, {{as well as the}} seat of the federal government. The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its <b>legislative</b> <b>function,</b> and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King).|$|E
5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a <b>legislative</b> <b>function</b> in many states, Kentucky {{governors}} are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E

5|$|Pichilemu {{is governed}} by the mayor (alcalde), who manages the {{executive}} function. The City Council (concejo municipal) manages the <b>legislative</b> <b>function.</b> The mayors and the councilors are elected popularly every four years, with possibility of re-election. Marcelo Cabrera Martínez was elected in 2008 as the new mayor with 42.08percent of the vote; he served from May to August 2009, when he was permanently banned from holding public office after being convicted for adulterating tickets. Then, the municipal council elected Roberto Córdova as new mayor on 9 September 2009. Between 2007 and 2009, Pichilemu had seven mayors, after Jorge Vargas González {{was removed from the}} office for committing the crime of bribery; he was mayor for over 10 years, from 1996 to 2007. Vargas was succeeded by Victor Rojas, who was later accused of the same crime and eventually removed from the office too. Roberto Córdova was popularly elected mayor {{for the first time in}} 2012 with 47.9percent. The current councilors of Pichilemu are Aldo Polanco Contreras, Andrea Aranda Escudero, Marta Urzúa Púa, Mario Morales Cárceles, Felipe Bustamante Olivares, and Hugo Toro Galaz. Both the mayor and the councilors took office on 6 December 2012, and their term will expire on 6 December 2016.|$|E

25|$|Griffith CJ {{expressed}} stronger {{views in}} relation to the constitutionality of the common rule provisions, stating that the function of an arbitrator was a judicial function that could only be exercised between parties to the dispute and after hearing them.

Griffith CJ emphasised the settlement of disputes between parties, with no apparent consideration as to the constitutional power {{in relation to}} the prevention of disputes.

25|$|Chua J. {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the basic features doctrine in Singapore. He reasoned that a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, can never be invalid if the procedure for amendment is complied with. If the framers of the Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. Furthermore, if the courts were allowed to impose limitations on the legislative power to amend, they would be usurping Parliament's <b>legislative</b> <b>function,</b> contrary to Article 58. In any case, Chua J. did not agree that Parliament had violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The subjective test reinserted into the ISA had served the national security interests of Singapore for a long time. The amendments merely reaffirmed the law which the courts had followed since Lee Mau Seng, and ensured that the legislative intent behind the ISA was not disregarded. Moreover, nothing in the amendments was unrelated to national security. A reaffirmation of the original principles could not be said to be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of law. The rule of law had not been abolished by legislation, as Parliament had done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to judicial review. The legislation did not order the court to decide a case in a particular way or to dismiss it – the court was left to deal with the case {{on the basis of the}} amendments.|$|E

500|$|Hand {{has been}} {{called one of the}} United States' most {{significant}} judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of judicial restraint, he took seriously Alexander Hamilton's formulation that [...] "the judiciary ...may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgement." [...] Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article [...] "Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day", he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York, which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws {{on the grounds that they}} restricted freedom of contract. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. [...] "For the state to intervene", he argued, [...] "to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a <b>legislative</b> <b>function</b> as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a <b>legislative</b> <b>function</b> in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Chua {{emphasized}} that fears of {{abuse of power}} by the Parliament should {{not lead to a}} denial of the power to amend the Constitution or restrict this power. He referred to Loh Kooi Choon v. Government of Malaysia (1977), where the Malaysian Federal Court said: [...] "The fear of abuse of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution in any way they think fit cannot be an argument against the existence of such power, for abuse of power can always be struck down". Furthermore, Chua asserted that allowing the courts to impose limitations on the legislature through the basic features doctrine, a judge-made rule, would amount to the judiciary usurping Parliament's <b>legislative</b> <b>function.</b> A similar view was expressed in Phang Chin Hock by the Chief Justice of Malaya, Raja Azlan Shah: [...] "A short answer to the fallacy of this doctrine is that it concedes to the court a more potent power of constitutional amendment through judicial legislation than the organ for and clearly chosen by the Constitution for the exercise of the amending power." [...] This could infringe the separation of powers doctrine and blur the distinction between the functions of the judiciary and the legislature.|$|E
2500|$|For {{two years}} after the end of the war, Alderney was {{operated}} as a communal farm. Craftsmen were paid by their employers, whilst others were paid by the local government out of the profit from the sales of farm produce. Remaining profits were put aside to repay the British Government for repairing and rebuilding the island. The local people resented being unable to control their own land; this led to the United Kingdom Home Office setting up an enquiry that led to the [...] "Government of Alderney Law 1948", which came into force on 1 January 1949. The law organised the construction and election of the States of Alderney and the justice system; and, for the first time in Alderney, the imposition of taxes. The legislature and judiciary were separated. The position of Judge, who had headed the island's government since the resignation of the last Governor in 1825, was abolished, and the Jurats were removed from their <b>legislative</b> <b>function.</b> Because of the island's small population, it was believed that the island could not be self-sufficient in running the airport and the harbour, or providing services that would match those of the UK. Taxes were therefore collected into the general Bailiwick of Guernsey revenue funds at the same rate as in Guernsey, and administered by the States of Guernsey. Guernsey became responsible for providing many government functions and services.|$|E
60|$|But in this passage, as {{throughout}} most of Plato's teaching, there is an identification of the good with the truly real, which became embodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely operative in our own day. In thus allowing a <b>legislative</b> <b>function</b> to the good, Plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science, from which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still suffering. The man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay them aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, {{if he is to}} achieve truth, must do the same. Ethical considerations can only legitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and should appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our manner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as themselves dictating what the truth is to be.|$|E
