With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, {{it is important}} to develop and deploy low-NOx combustion technologies for pulverized coal boilers burning low-volatile coal. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a novel decoupling combustion system for low-volatile coal via experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The combustion system includes horizontal fuel-rich/lean <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> (<b>LNB)</b> and the associated air distribution system for a polygonal tangentially fired boiler (PTFB). The effects of coal particle diameter and coal feeding rate on the gas/particle flow characteristics of the burner, and the cold state aerodynamic field of the PTFB were analyzed in detail. The structural design of the LNB results in advantageous gas/particle flow characteristics and the PTFB improved the distribution of the flow field. The CFD models and simulation results were validated by comparing with those of cold experiments data. The simulation results demonstrated that this low-NOx combustion technology enhances staged combustion at different scales, which can reduce NOx generation significantly. In the industrial application on a 300 MW pulverized coal boiler, installation of the LNBs improved the stability of low-volatile coal combustion and reduced NOx emissions significantly. These research findings provide valuable guidance to the design of low-NOx combustion system for pulverized coal boilers using low volatile coal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the {{coal-fired}} power industry began a more accelerated move toward using <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> (<b>LNB)</b> technologies to reduce NOx emissions. Most LNBs incorporate less oxygen with the coal initially, creating a cooler and somewhat substoichiometric initial combustion zone, with additional oxygen added further on in the combustion process to complete char combustion. Another method used to achieve lower NOx emissions is to fire the coal substoichiometrically and add additional air through overfire air ports. Both of these methods create certain impacts on fireside performance that are different from conventional high-excess-air firing arrangements. Some of the impacts that have been noticed by the utility industry are higher levels of unburned carbon in the fly ash and bottom ash, increased boiler tube corrosion, higher particulate loadings on control devices, and changes in slagging in the main furnace. Work on the fundamental mechanisms of entrained ash and ash deposit formation during low-NOx combustion has been sparse. This project by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) focuses on the issues of entrained ash formation and slagging for low-NOx combustion systems in general. Time-resolved combustion tests under conventional and low-NOx conditions have been conducted to note particle-size formation and slagging deposition. The results from this work are yielding an increased understanding of the mechanisms of ash formation during low-NOx combustion along with methods for enhancing heat transfer and fly ash collectability. Specific objectives of this research project include (1) determining whether initial char and ash generated under low-NOx conditions have greater tendencies for slagging than conventionally generated ash and (2) determining the differences, if any, between particle size and composition for entrained ash generated under low-NOx and conventional combustion conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Low-NOx</b> surface <b>burners</b> {{have been}} found to {{generate}} a great amount of noise and heat release fluctuations in certain working regimes. The wide range application of these <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> is difficult due to this thermo-acoustic instability. The mechanism behind this instability is still not fully understood. The origin is believed to lie a low-frequency instability which occurs in the near wake of high solidity plates. In order to enable the suppression of this thermo-acoustic instability, the low-frequency flow instability in the near wake of perforated plates is investigated using hot-wire anemometry (HWA) and high-end particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. From these measurements the spectral content of the flow is investigated and it is found that the low-frequency instability is a robust phenomenon which occurs in transition region from laminar to turbulent flow. The oscillation starts to occur beyond a critical Reynolds number. Within the transition regime, the oscillation frequency is found to increase linearly for increasing Reynolds number. This implies that the Strouhal number of the low-frequency instability remains constant. The instability is found to be absent near the boundaries of the perforated plate which also introduces the concept of a critical number of jets. A critical number of jets have to be present in order for the phenomenon to occur. Together with this limit there exists a trade-off between Reynolds number and number of jets, as we find that the decrease in number of jets increases the critical Reynolds number...|$|R

Accordingly, this research program focuses on the development of activated carbons from the unburned carbon present in fly ash. During the present reporting period (June 30, 1999 [...] June 29, 2000), Task 1 ''Procurement and characterization of CCBPs'' was initiated and samples from various combustion systems were collected. The suite assembled thus far includes samples from pulverized utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> and Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system, and also from an utility cyclone unit. The characterization studies showed that the sample from the cyclone unit contained the highest carbon content (LOI of {approx} 80 %), since this unit has been retrofitted with a technology to separate the unburned carbon from the fly ash. In contrast, the sample from the unit retrofitted with a Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system showed the lowest carbon content with LOI values around 2 - 4 %. The samples from the utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> were collected from the hot-side hoppers and present carbon contents {approx} 50 %. The BET (N{sub 2 } 77 K) surface areas of the samples investigated were between 30 - 40 m{sup 2 }/g and the pore volume is mainly due to mesopores.

In the second quarter, additional fly-ash samples were collected from the E. D. Edwards station (Bartonville, IL). Experimentation was begun to study the removal of carbon from these fly-ashes by froth flotation, and make and test pellets that use fly-ash as binder. During the current quarter, flotation experiments were continued on the fly- ashes. Three types of ashes were studied: 1. Ash from the disposal pond (``wet`` ash); 2. Dry fly-ash collected directly from the standard burners (``low-carbon`` ash); 3. Dry fly-ash collected from the <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> (``high-carbon`` ash). Each of these was chemically analyzed, and conventional flotation experiments were carried out to determine the optimum reagent dosages for carbon removal. Decarbonized ashes were then made from each ash type, in sufficient quantity to be used in pelletization experiments...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulations}} of oxy-coal combustion experiments {{conducted at the}} IFRF at the semi-industrial scale with two different burners, i. e. the Aerodynamically Air Staged Burner (AASB) and the <b>low-NOx</b> TEA-C <b>burner,</b> were performed in order to investigate the performance of different sub-models for oxy–fired conditions. Special attention was devoted to the reduction of computational cost by using proper modelling strategies based on reduced and complete computational domains. The uncertainties due to the choice of different sub-models and boundary conditions are discussed, highlighting the need for accurate and comprehensive experimental datasets to validate computational models. Discussion is made {{of the use of}} proper validation metrics to quantify the level of agreement between predictions and experiments...|$|R
