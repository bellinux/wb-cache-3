5|$|On 6January 1930, {{the rear}} {{carriages}} of a passenger train from Hastings to London were partially buried by a <b>landslip</b> near Wadhurst tunnel. The train was divided {{and the front}} part continued on to Tunbridge Wells, where it arrived 100 minutes late.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron piloted by Flying officer John Greenwood flew {{under the}} deck while {{performing}} a victory roll before crashing in Leigh Woods, killing the pilot. The accident caused a <b>landslip</b> {{that led to}} the temporary closure of the nearby Bristol to Portishead railway line. A police helicopter flew under the bridge during a search in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Land erosion has {{damaged the}} East Blockhouse site; the north wall {{collapsed}} before 1975, and between 2010 and 2011 {{there was another}} major <b>landslip.</b> An archaeological survey of the blockhouse, funded by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw, took place in 2011. The East Blockhouse is the only such defensive structure to survive in Wales and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
40|$|As {{the mountainside}} of Tara volcano was {{suffered}} from a diaster of <b>landslips</b> by the torrential rain in July 1957, the writer investigated them during 2 months {{towards the end of}} autumn. In this paper, he explained an interpretation on the morphological structure of the <b>landslips</b> and classified them into several types. He studied the relation of the distribution of <b>landslips</b> and volcanic rocks. The rocks of Tara volcano are classified in ascending order as follows. : 1. Palaeogene beds, 2. Volcanic conglomerates, 3. Basalts, 4. Agglomerates, 5. Alternation of lavas and agglomerates, 6. Quarternary conglomerates. The <b>landslips</b> are mainly distributed in the regions of 5 and 4, and they were frequently found in the agglomerates above and below the andestic lavas. Outcrops of <b>landslips</b> are constantly found in the agglomerates...|$|R
50|$|<b>Landslips</b> {{are common}} on the steep {{sides of the}} {{coalfield}} valleys where a combination of glacial over-deepening {{and the presence of}} the Pennant Sandstone overlying weaker mudstones has provided favourable conditions for ground movement. Mining activity has reactivated ancient <b>landslips</b> in certain cases.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{landslides}} {{also occurred}} at Shiu Fai Terrace in Wan Chai. In total, three large <b>landslips</b> occurred over a continuous area on June 16. They {{were not as}} large as the Po Shan Road disaster but altogether affected a greater area. Several were killed by the <b>landslips.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 23 December 2013, a <b>landslip</b> at Wadhurst was {{the first}} in a series of landslips up to February 2014 which led the line between Wadhurst and St. Leonards Warrior Square being closed and reopened three times, with speed {{restrictions}} in place following repairs. The train service was replaced by buses during closures. Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period. By 12 March, the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened, with full service being restored on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation, {{and to a lesser}} extent by subsequent sea level changes. In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater <b>landslip</b> off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are infrequent and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically active area of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which is a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of the island's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas. In the post-glacial epoch, , the islands experienced a tsunami up to 20metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater <b>landslip</b> {{off the coast of}} Norway.|$|E

5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising {{from the edge of the}} valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of <b>landslip.</b>|$|E

25|$|The rabbits rapidly multiplied before {{numbers were}} reduced to about 10,000 in the early 1980s when {{myxomatosis}} was introduced. Rabbit numbers then grew again to over 100,000 by 2006. The rodents feed on young chicks while rabbits nibbling on the grass layer has led to soil erosion and cliff collapses, destroying seabird nests. Large portions of the Macquarie Island bluffs are eroding as a result. In September 2006 a large <b>landslip</b> at Lusitania Bay, {{on the eastern side}} of the island, partially destroyed an important penguin breeding colony. Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service attributed the <b>landslip</b> to a combination of heavy spring rains and severe erosion caused by rabbits.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{areas of}} Launceston {{are subject to}} <b>landslip</b> problems, while others are liable to poor {{drainage}} and periodic flooding. The topography of the area is not conducive to easy dispersion of airborne pollution, due to the phenomenon of thermal inversion.|$|E
25|$|In Dorset {{a couple}} {{were killed when}} heavy rains caused a <b>landslip</b> and partial {{collapse}} of the Beaminster Tunnel. 700 tonnes of mud slid onto the roadway completely covering the vehicle on 7 July. Dorset Police {{at the time were}} dealing with 150 flood warnings in the county and the evacuation of 180 houses with 400 incidents reported to police control room. A cursory inspection of the <b>landslip</b> did not reveal the presence of the vehicle and it was not until after the couple were reported as missing that the police re-investigated the debris and found the crushed car on 15 July. The Dorset Police force was criticised for failing to find the bodies sooner and the case was voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to be reviewed.|$|E
