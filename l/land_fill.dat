The accumulation of 8,000 m3/day of domestic garbage piled up, causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and water contamination.

25|$|Necessity. Corporate tree-planting {{is not a}} new idea; farming {{operations}} have been used by companies making paper from trees for a long time. If farmed trees are replanted, and the products made from them are placed into landfills rather than recycled, a very safe, efficient, economical and time-proven method of geological sequestration of greenhouse carbon {{is the result of the}} paper product use cycle. This only holds if the paper in the <b>land</b> <b>fill</b> is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissions.|$|E

2500|$|A 2011 {{proposal}} by Vishaan Chakrabarti, {{a professor at}} Columbia University's Center for Urban Real Estate, suggested using <b>land</b> <b>fill</b> to connect lower Manhattan and Governors Island, so creating a new neighborhood referred to as [...] "LoLo". <b>Land</b> <b>fill</b> {{has been used to}} expand Manhattan before, most notably in the creation of Battery Park City, which utilized material from the construction of the original World Trade Center. Chakrabarti and others have pointed out challenges to the proposal, which include cost, the strict regulations surrounding building with <b>land</b> <b>fill,</b> and the potential environmental effects of the project. The proposal was revisited in 2015 by author Jon Methven of The Awl, in which he referred to the proposed borough as [...] "Frankenborough".|$|E

During excavation of the site and construction of the towers, the original Hudson Tubes remained in service as elevated tunnels. The Hudson Terminal was shut down in 1971 when a new Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH Railroad station was completed. The new station cost $35 million to build.

2500|$|In December 2015 the Lebanese {{government}} {{signed an}} agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by Chinook Sciences, to export over 100,000 tons of untreated waste from [...] Beirut and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest <b>land</b> <b>fill</b> site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in Holland and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which [...] is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers. Initial reports that the waste was to be exported to Sierra Leone have been denied by diplomats. In February 2016 the government withdrew from negotiations after it was revealed that documents relating to the export of the trash to Russia were forgeries. On 19 March 2016, the Cabinet reopened the Naameh landfill for 60 days in line with a plan it passed few days earlier to end the trash crisis. The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in Bourj Hammoud and Costa Brava, east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that more than 8,000 tons of garbage had been collected so far as part of the government’s trash plan in only 24 hours. The plan's execution is still ongoing.|$|E

40|$|Cable {{recycling}} {{is an important}} source of high-grade secondary copper. Unfortunately, for every kg of copper produced, the cable recycling process also creates some 2 kg of residue: a complex mixture of PVC insulation, ill-liberated cable parts, very fine copper wire and a minor amount of other materials. This paper investigates two scenarios for this residue in terms of Life Cycle Assessment: <b>land</b> <b>filling</b> versus an innovative process that recycles over 90 mass% of the residue by means of a precise separation on density into a clean PVC fraction and a fine copper product. In order to compare the two scenarios and account for the quality issue of recycled materials, the <b>land</b> <b>filling</b> option is extended with the production of copper and PVC from primary resources, in quantities that represent the same market value as the recycled materials in the recycling scenario. The result of the analysis indicates that, despite this conservative approach, the recycling scenario reduces the relevant impacts by a factor of ten with respect to <b>land</b> <b>filling...</b>|$|R
