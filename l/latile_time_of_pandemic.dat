Method: The method involves searching review and research studies in Pubmed data base mainly of the 2000 until 2009 and the words were used is pregnancy, flu vaccination, complications of the flu vaccination at the period of pregnancy.

Methods: Two telephone surveys were conducted with a 4 month interval, at the beginning of H 1 N 1 pandemic alert level 5 and 6, on 90 and 100 general practitioners, respectively. The knowledge of these physicians on the symptoms of H 1 N 1 flu, the transmission methods, the preventative measures, and existing treatments along with the sources used for gathering information were assessed. Results: While mass media was the main source of gathering informa-tion in the H 1 N 1 pandemic alert level 5, more professional sources were used at the H 1 N 1 pandemic alert level 6. Despite the acceptable improvement noted in the knowledge of the physicians during the two phases of the study, their understanding of the disease was believed to be less than the expected level based on H 1 N 1 pandemic alert level.

40|$|A {{significant}} feature <b>of</b> influenza <b>pandemics</b> is multiple {{waves of}} {{morbidity and mortality}} over a few months or years. The size of these successive waves depends on intervention strategies including antivirals and vaccination, as well as the effects of immunity gained from previous infection. However, the global vaccine manufacturing capacity is limited. Also, antiviral stockpiles are costly and thus, are limited to very few countries. The combined effect of antivirals and vaccination in successive waves <b>of</b> a <b>pandemic</b> has not been quantified. The effect of acquired immunity from vaccination and previous infection has also not been characterized. In <b>times</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pandemic</b> threat countries must consider the effects of a limited vaccine, limited antiviral use and the effects of prior immunity so as to adopt a pandemic strategy that will best aid the population.

Results Results of this study show differences across Europe in the extent to which national pandemic policy and pandemic plans have been integrated with public health laws. We found significant differences in legislation and in the legitimacy of strategic plans. States differ in the range and the nature of intervention measures authorized by law, the extent to which borders could be closed to movement of persons and goods during a pandemic, and access to healthcare of non-resident persons. Some states propose use of emergency powers that might potentially override human rights protections while other states propose to limit interventions to those authorized by public health laws. Conclusion These differences could create problems for European strategies if an evolving influenza pandemic results in more serious public health challenges or, indeed, if a novel disease other than influenza emerges with pandemic potential. There is insufficient understanding across Europe of the role and importance <b>of</b> law in <b>pandemic</b> planning.

40|$|Rationale: Every year {{influenza}} viruses cause new {{outbreaks of}} respiratory tract infections. The selective pressure on circulating influenza viruses exerted by strain-specific antibody responses drives an antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses {{and leads to}} pandemics. Therefore {{there is a growing}} demand on seasonal influenza vaccines in order to adapt to the current virus strain. An optimal pandemic influenza vaccine should fulfil certain requirements, like an easy and safe administration, strong and effective immune response and a fast and economic way of high amount production in order to allow quick access in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>pandemics.</b> In this study we tested local immunotoxicity of a new nanoparticle-based inhalable influenza vaccine in murine and human precision cut lung slices (PCLS) ex vivo. Methods: Murine and human PCLS were treated with different concentrations of SiO 2 -nanoparticles, plant-derived influenza H 1 N 1 (A/California / 04 / 09) antigen (HAC 1) only or HAC 1 antigen formulated with SiO 2 -nanoparticles (ratio HAC 1 :SiO 2 = 1 %). Tissue vitality was determined by WST- 1 assay and live/dead staining. Cytokine secretion was measured by MSD and ELISA assays. Results: Both, murine and human PCLS showed a trend towards attenuation in vitality at high concentrations of SiO 2 only or in combination with HAC 1. No additional effect in the combined treatment could be observed. However, the highest doses of SiO 2 are far above the intended human dosages, but were chosen to determine the limits of our test system. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a was not induced by the different treatments. In contrast, IL- 8 and murine KC were significantly increased at high SiO 2 concentrations of 1000 µg/ml. Additionally, a dose-dependent increase of IL- 2 and IFN-y was observed in human PCLS for the antigen and the combined treatment of SiO 2 -nanoparticles and antigen. Conclusion: The low toxicity and the induced immunoregulatory cytokine profile demonstrate that the formulation of an antigen with SiO 2 -nanoparticles is a promising system for pandemic influenza vaccine development...|$|R

Between May and September 2009, a total of 24415 cases were successfully geocoded, out of 25473 (95. 8 %) reports in the original dataset. The reconstructed epidemic curve was characterized by a small initial peak, a nadir followed by rapid rise to the ultimate plateau. The full course of the epidemic had lasted for about 6 months. Despite the small geographic area of only 1000 Km 2, distinctive spatial variation was observed in the configuration of the curves across 6 geographic regions. With the relatively uniform physical and climatic environment within Hong Kong, the temporo-spatial variability of influenza spread could only be explained by the heterogeneous population structure and mobility patterns. Our study illustrated how an epidemic curve could be reconstructed using regularly collected surveillance data, which would be useful in informing intervention at local levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Zipf's law and Heaps' law are two {{representatives of}} the scaling concepts, which play a {{significant}} role in the study of complexity science. The coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law motivates different understandings on the dependence between these two scalings, which has still hardly been clarified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we observe an evolution process of the scalings: the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law are naturally shaped to coexist at the initial time, while the crossover comes with the emergence of their inconsistency at the larger time before reaching a stable state, where the Heaps' law still exists with the disappearance of strict Zipf's law. Such findings are illustrated with a scenario of large-scale spatial epidemic spreading, and the empirical results <b>of</b> <b>pandemic</b> disease support a universal analysis of the relation between the two laws regardless of the biological details of disease. Employing the United States domestic air transportation and demographic data to construct a metapopulation model for simulating the pandemic spread at the U. S. country level, we uncover that the broad heterogeneity of the infrastructure plays a key role in the evolution of scaling emergence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The analyses of large-scale spatial epidemic spreading help understand the temporal evolution of scalings, indicating the coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law depends on the collective dynamics of epidemic processes, and the heterogeneity of epidemic spread indicates the significance of performing targeted containment strategies at the early <b>time</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pandemic</b> disease...|$|R

ResultsA total of 64 195 cases of influenza-like illness were registered in public health services in the region between week 40, 2009 and week 4, 2010. The cumulative attack rate of those cases was 17. 1 / 1 000 inhabitants. Most of the cases occurred in females and in the under 20 years. The peak of the Autumn/Winter wave was attained in week 48, but geographic and <b>time</b> distribution <b>of</b> the <b>pandemic</b> was heterogeneous in the region.
