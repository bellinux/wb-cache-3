5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, <b>lindane,</b> theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lindane</b> is a neurotoxin that {{interferes with}} GABA {{neurotransmitter}} function by {{interacting with the}} GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex at the picrotoxin binding site. In humans, <b>lindane</b> affects the nervous system, liver, and kidneys, and {{may well be a}} carcinogen. Whether <b>lindane</b> is an endocrine disruptor is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to large}} amounts of <b>lindane</b> can harm the nervous system, {{producing}} a range of symptoms from headache and dizziness to seizures, convulsions, and more rarely, death. <b>Lindane</b> has not been shown to affect the immune system in humans, {{and it is not}} considered to be genotoxic. Prenatal exposure to β-HCH, an isomer of <b>lindane</b> and production byproduct, has been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels and could affect brain development.|$|E
25|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{have set}} {{occupational}} exposure limits (permissible exposure and recommended exposure, respectively) for <b>lindane</b> at 0.5mg/m3 at a time-weighted average of eight hours for skin exposure. People can {{be exposed to}} <b>lindane</b> in the workplace by inhaling it, absorbing it through their skin, swallowing it, and eye contact. At levels of 50mg/m3, <b>lindane</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} adverse {{reactions}} to <b>lindane</b> pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to seizures, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness, and rash. While serious effects are rare and have most often resulted from misuse, adverse reactions have occurred when used properly. The FDA, therefore, requires a so-called black box warning on <b>lindane</b> products, which explains {{the risks of}} <b>lindane</b> products and their proper use.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, {{the use of}} <b>lindane</b> {{had been}} banned in 52 {{countries}} and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use. In 2009, an international ban {{on the use of}} <b>lindane</b> in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for five more years. The production of the <b>lindane</b> isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. Although the US has not ratified the Convention, it has similarly banned agricultural uses while still allowing its use a second-line lice and scabies treatment.|$|E
25|$|The only agents {{approved}} by the FDA for treatment of pediculosis are topical ivermectin lotion, <b>lindane,</b> and malathion.|$|E
25|$|Over time, <b>lindane</b> {{is broken}} down in soil, sediment, and water into less harmful {{substances}} by algae, fungi, and bacteria; however, {{the process is}} relatively slow and dependent on ambient environmental conditions. <b>Lindane</b> residues in honey and beeswax are reported to be the highest of any historical or current pesticide and to continue to {{pose a threat to}} honeybee health. The ecological impact of lindane's environmental persistence continues to be debated.|$|E
25|$|In the US, <b>lindane</b> {{pesticide}} {{products were}} {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while <b>lindane</b> medications are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was registered as an agricultural insecticide in the 1940s, and as pharmaceutical in 1951. The EPA gradually began restricting its agricultural use in the 1970s due to concerns over its effects on {{human health and the}} environment. By 2002, its use was limited to seed treatments for just six crops, and in 2007, these last uses were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (<b>lindane),</b> organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), pyrethrins (pyrethrum), pyrethroids (permethrin, phenothrin, bioallethrin), and spinosad (spinosyn A and spinosyn D).|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} diazepam {{can help in}} the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to sarin, VX, or soman (or other organophosphate poisons), <b>lindane,</b> chloroquine, physostigmine, or pyrethroids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lindane</b> is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant: {{it is relatively}} long-lived in the environment, it is transported long distances by natural processes like global distillation, and it can bioaccumulate in food chains, though it is rapidly eliminated when exposure is discontinued.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lindane,</b> {{also known}} as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, (γ-HCCH), gammaxene, Gammallin and {{sometimes}} incorrectly called benzene hexachloride (BHC), is an organochlorine chemical variant of hexachlorocyclohexane {{that has been used}} both as an agricultural insecticide and as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include <b>lindane,</b> benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. <b>Lindane</b> is effective, but {{concerns over}} potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, {{but may be}} used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or benzyl benzoate are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; Some 10% sulfur solutions {{have been shown to be}} effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at least a week, though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than permethrin in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of permethrin for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of permethrin.|$|E
25|$|The {{black box}} warning {{emphasizes}} that <b>lindane</b> {{should not be}} used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis, psoriasis) and people who weigh less than 110lbs (50kg), as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} {{was originally}} synthesised in 1825 by Faraday. It {{is named after}} the Dutch chemist Teunis van der Linden (1884–1965), the first to isolate and describe γ-hexachlorcyclohexane in 1912. Its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which <b>lindane</b> production, by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It {{has been used to}} treat food crops and forestry products, as a seed treatment, a soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a shampoo or lotion. Between 1950 and 2000, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of <b>lindane</b> were produced globally, {{and the vast majority of}} which was used in agriculture. It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries, but as of 2007, only India and possibly Russia are still producing it.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 1950s and 1960s, 40% of all U.S. {{pesticide}} exports went to Central America. Nicaragua and {{its neighbors}} widely used compounds banned in the U.S., such as DDT, endrin, dieldrin and <b>lindane.</b> In 1977 a study revealed that mothers living in León had 45 times more DDT in their breast milk than the World Health Organization safe level.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the EPA {{showed that}} 54 active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients and 10 metabolites {{had been found}} in treated drinking water. An earlier study from 2005 by the EPA and the Geographical Survey states that 40% of water was contaminated with nonprescription pharmaceuticals, and {{it has been reported that}} 8 of the 12 most commonly occurring chemicals in drinking water are estrogenic hormones. Of the pharmaceutical components found in drinking water, the EPA only regulates <b>lindane.</b> In 2009, the EPA did announce another 13 chemicals, hormones, and antibiotics that could potentially be regulated. In 2011 EPA announced it would develop regulations for perchlorate.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are available to}} treat those infected, including permethrin, crotamiton, and <b>lindane</b> creams and ivermectin pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and {{people who live in}} the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E
500|$|The Central Laboratory's focus at {{this time}} was on the {{chemistry}} of chlorine and fluorine. Electrolysis of salt water produced chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), but there was not as much demand for the chlorine, so ICI was eager to create new products using chlorine that it could sell. New products that were created included various solvents, chlorinated rubber, and <b>Lindane,</b> an insecticide developed in collaboration with ICI's Agricultural Research Station at Jealott's Hill. Baxter personally received a number of patents for his work. He became Research Manager of the General Chemicals Division in 1935. He reorganised the Central Laboratory into seven sections, {{each with its own}} Assistant Research Manager, an organisational structure known as [...] "Baxter and the seven dwarves", which was not generally considered a success at the time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lindane</b> is the gamma isomer of {{hexachlorocyclohexane}} ("γ-HCH"). In {{addition to}} the issue of <b>lindane</b> pollution, some concerns are related to the other isomers of HCH, namely alpha-HCH and beta-HCH, which are notably more toxic than <b>lindane,</b> lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of <b>lindane</b> production. In the 1940s and 1950s, <b>lindane</b> producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites. Modern manufacturing standards for <b>lindane</b> involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as [...] "cracking". Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public-health uses of <b>lindane</b> and declining agricultural needs. <b>Lindane</b> has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but continues to be imported.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} and agricultural use of <b>lindane</b> {{are the primary}} causes of environmental contamination, and levels of <b>lindane</b> in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns. The production of <b>lindane</b> generates large amounts of waste hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and [...] "every ton of <b>lindane</b> manufactured produces about 9 tons of toxic waste." [...] Modern manufacturing standards for <b>lindane</b> involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic molecules, {{a process known as}} [...] "cracking".|$|E
2500|$|The US EPA {{determined}} in 2002 {{that the agency}} {{does not believe that}} <b>lindane</b> contaminates drinking water in excess of levels considered safe. U.S. Geological Survey teams concluded the same in 1999 and 2000. With regard to <b>lindane</b> medications, the EPA conducted [...] "down-the-drain" [...] estimates of the amount of <b>lindane</b> reaching public water supplies and concluded that <b>lindane</b> levels from pharmaceutical sources were [...] "extremely low" [...] and not of concern.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lindane</b> {{medications}} {{continue to}} {{be available in the}} US, though since 1995, they have been designated [...] "second-line" [...] treatments, meaning they should be prescribed when other [...] "first-line" [...] treatments have failed or cannot be used. In December 2007, the FDA sent a Warning Letter to Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals, the sole U.S. manufacturer of <b>lindane</b> products, requesting that the company correct misleading information on two of its <b>lindane</b> websites. The letter said, in part, that the materials [...] "are misleading in that they omit and/or minimize the most serious and important risk information {{associated with the use of}} <b>Lindane</b> Shampoo, particularly in pediatric patients; include a misleading dosing claim; and overstate the efficacy of <b>Lindane</b> Shampoo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Based {{primarily}} on evidence from animal studies, most evaluations of <b>lindane</b> {{have concluded that}} it may possibly cause cancer. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer [...] classified <b>lindane</b> as a known human carcinogen, and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was [...] "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential." [...] The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that all isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, including <b>lindane,</b> [...] "may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans," [...] and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for <b>lindane</b> as [...] "suggestive ... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential." [...] <b>Lindane</b> and its isomers have also been on California's Proposition 65 list of known carcinogens since 1989. In contrast, the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that [...] "lindane {{is not likely to}} pose a carcinogenic risk to humans." [...] India's BIS considers <b>Lindane</b> a [...] "confirmed carcinogen".|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} EPA {{has set the}} maximum {{contaminant}} level or [...] "MCL" [...] for <b>lindane</b> allowed in public water supplies and considered safe for drinking at 200 parts per trillion (ppt). By comparison, the state of California imposes a lower MCL for <b>lindane</b> of 19 ppt. However, the California standard {{is based on a}} dated 1988 national water criterion that was subsequently revised by the EPA in 2003 to 980 ppt. The EPA stated that the change resulted from [...] "significant scientific advances made {{in the last two decades}} particularly in the areas of cancer and noncancer risk assessments." [...] While the EPA considered raising the MCL standard for <b>lindane</b> to 980 ppt at that time, the change was never implemented because states had little difficultly in maintaining <b>lindane</b> levels below the 200 ppt MCL limit already in place. Today, the legally enforceable MCL standard for <b>lindane</b> is 200 ppt, while the national water criterion for <b>lindane</b> is 980 ppt.|$|E
2500|$|When <b>lindane</b> {{is used in}} agriculture, an {{estimated}} 12–30% of it volatilizes into the atmosphere, where it is subject to long-range transport and can be deposited by rainfall. <b>Lindane</b> in soil can leach to surface and even ground water, and can bioaccumulate in the food chain. However, biotransformation and elimination are relatively rapid when exposure is discontinued. Most exposure {{of the general population}} to <b>lindane</b> has resulted from agricultural uses and the intake of foods, such as produce, meats, and milk, produced from treated agricultural commodities. Human exposure has decreased significantly since the cancellation of agricultural uses in 2006. Even so, the CDC published in 2005 its Third National Report on Human Exposures to Environmental Chemicals, which found no detectable amounts of <b>lindane</b> in human blood taken from a random sampling of about 5,000 people in the US as part of the NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm [...] ). The lack of detection of <b>lindane</b> in this large human [...] "biomonitoring" [...] study likely reflects the increasingly limited agricultural uses of <b>lindane</b> over the last two decades. [...] The cancellation of agricultural uses in the United States will further reduce the amount of <b>lindane</b> introduced into the environment by more than 99%.|$|E
2500|$|California {{banned the}} {{pharmaceutical}} <b>lindane,</b> effective 2002, and the Michigan House of Representatives {{passed a bill}} in 2009 to restrict its use to doctors' offices. A recent analysis of the California ban concluded {{that a majority of}} pediatricians had not experienced problems treating lice or scabies since that ban took effect. The study also documented a marked decrease in <b>lindane</b> wastewater contamination and a dramatic decline in <b>lindane</b> poisoning incidents reported to poison control centers. The authors concluded, [...] "The California experience suggests elimination of pharmaceutical <b>lindane</b> produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The EPA and WHO both {{classify}} <b>lindane</b> as [...] "moderately" [...] acutely toxic. It has an oral [...] of 88mg/kg in {{rats and}} a dermal LD50 of 1000mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for <b>lindane</b> have {{been related to}} agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed-treatment workers.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization classifies <b>lindane</b> as [...] "moderately hazardous", and its {{international}} trade is restricted and regulated under the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent. In 2009, {{the production and}} agricultural use of <b>lindane</b> was banned under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. A specific exemption to that ban allows it {{to continue to be}} used as a second-line pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies.|$|E
2500|$|The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants {{considers}} {{the use of}} <b>lindane</b> in agriculture as largely redundant, with other, less toxic and less persistent pesticides. [...] In the case of pharmaceutical use, the committee noted, [...] "alternatives for pharmaceutical uses have often failed for scabies and lice treatment {{and the number of}} available alternative products for this use is scarce. For this particular case, a reasonable alternative would be to use <b>lindane</b> as a second-line treatment when other treatments fail, while potential new treatments are assessed." ...|$|E
