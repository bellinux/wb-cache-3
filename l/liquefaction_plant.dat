5|$|Attacks on airfields and {{transportation}} infrastructure in southern Japan continued {{until the end}} of the war. By this time the Fifth Air Force's bombers had flown 138 sorties against airfields in Kyushu and the Seventh Air Force had conducted a further 784. Road and railway bridges were attacked by both fighters and bombers, and the city of Kagoshima was frequently bombed. Seventh Air Force B-24 Liberators also bombed the railway terminals in the port of Nagasaki on 31July and 1August. While these raids were focused on tactical targets, the Okinawa-based aircraft made several strategic attacks against industrial facilities; these included an unsuccessful raid on a coal <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plant</b> at Ōmuta on 7August. Bombers of the Fifth and Seventh Air Forces also made firebombing attacks against Tarumizu on 5August, Kumamoto on 10August and Kurume the next day. The FEAF staged its last attacks against Japan on 12August; aircraft were dispatched on 14August but recalled while en route to their targets. Overall, the two air forces flew 6,435 sorties against targets in Kyushu during July and August for the loss of 43 aircraft to Japanese anti-aircraft guns and fighters.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the cost}} of {{building}} an LNG <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plant</b> cost $350 per tpa (tonne per year). In 2000s, it was $200/tpa. In 2012, the costs can go as high as $1,000/tpa, partly due to the increase in the price of steel.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, {{the large}} number of orders {{increased}} demand for shipyard slots, raising their price and increasing ship costs. The per-ton construction cost of an LNG <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plant</b> fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s. The cost reduced by approximately 35 percent. However, recently the cost of building liquefaction and regasification terminals doubled due to increased cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor, professional engineers, designers, managers and other white-collar professionals.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} towards small scale natural gas <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plants,</b> mainly due to the increasing energy demand and quest for cleaner combustion.

50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} often used to drive {{compression}} trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plants)</b> and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine (often {{referred to as the}} Gas Generator), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a power turbine or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters, especially, because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an automotive transmission's fluid coupling. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|Natural gas is a {{versatile}} energy resource. The demand {{for natural gas}} is constantly rising and new sources for natural gas are needed. Some of these sources can be very remote and conventional production methods cannot be applied. Small remote natural gas reservoirs might hold valuable resources but {{the construction of a}} pipeline from these reservoirs is not feasible. In these cases small scale <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plants</b> can help to transform the gas into a liquid and thus open up new ways of storing, transporting and using the resource. These small scale <b>liquefaction</b> <b>plants</b> have to consider the investment cost, efficiency and running costs of a project.

These properties can be used in a heat exchanger to create a compact heat exchanger design. Such heat exchangers have already been used for example in waste heat recovery from factory exhaust. In this work the application of a heat pipe heat exchanger for the use in a natural gas liquefaction heat exchanger is investigated.
