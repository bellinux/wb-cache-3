5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

25|$|The Downing Stadium was {{the first}} stadium built on the island, as a WPA project, and upon its opening on July 11, 1936, 15,000 {{attendees}} witnessed Jesse Owens compete at Randalls Island Stadium in the Men's Olympic Trials. Downing Stadium also hosted the Women's Olympic Trials in 1964. It {{was the site of}} an international soccer friendly in which England defeated the USA, 10–0, on May 27, 1964. In 1960, the owners of Ebbets Field donated 500 stadium lights to Downing Stadium. The <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> from the old stadium, which was being torn down.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} the Brothers of Destruction was {{announced}} on October 27, 2006 episode of SmackDown!.

When the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> back on Kane was gone, nowhere to be found. As a result of the interference, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match: The Brothers of Destruction vs. Kennedy and MVP. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers of Destruction reunited {{for the first time as}} a tag team in five years and gathered three wins over MVP and Mr Kennedy in that one night. The first win was made by countout, the second was by a disqualification at which point General Manager Theodore Long twice came out and restarted the match with no disqualifications or countouts. Finally, the brothers hit simultaneous chokeslams, and Undertaker finished with a Tombstone Piledriver to Mr. Kennedy.|$|E

On the January 21 episode of Raw, The Shield performed a triple-powerbomb on The Rock, Punk's WWE Championship contender at the event, resulting in Mr. McMahon declaring that their interference in the title match would result in Punk being stripped of the title. Four days later on SmackDown, Punk denied an alliance with The Shield before calling them out and informing them {{that he did not}} want them to interfere in his upcoming title match. However, during Punk's title match at the Royal Rumble on January 27 a blackout occurred, The Rock was attacked by The Shield in the darkness and when the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> back on he had been put through the announce table, leading to Punk pinning The Rock and retaining the title, only for the match to be immediately restarted by McMahon with The Rock winning the WWE Championship. The following night on Raw it was revealed through footage played by McMahon that Punk's manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for him all along.|$|E
500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] was {{performed}} on The Howard Stern Show on November 12, 2013. During her second Thanksgiving television special, Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, which aired on ABC, Gaga sang [...] "Gypsy" [...] as a duet with Kermit the Frog. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticised the performance saying that [...] "Kermit was earnest and well , but it didn't feel like {{the product of a}} Lady Gaga and The Muppets special; it felt like Kermit making a cameo in a Lady Gaga special, a problem given the shared billing in the title." [...] Conversely Rolling Stones Marissa Muller listed it as one of the five memorable moments from the special. Gaga performed [...] "Gypsy" [...] as the encore to her 2014 show at South by Southwest. It was the also the closing song of Gaga's 2014 [...] tour. She sang it wearing long white wig and a dress with a long white train. During some of the shows, Gaga brought audience members onstage to sing the song together. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone criticised the choice of the song as the show's finale, saying that it felt anticlimactic. [...] "After a one-song encore of 'Gypsy', the house <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> up... it was startling to realize the show was already over. [...] didn't have superstar moves or hits saved up for the big finale—she decided not to do a big finale at all," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

500|$|In the video, Janet Jackson {{takes on}} a darker persona, {{previously}} unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael {{is seen in the}} room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E
2500|$|The American ECD {{was once}} again {{restricted}} to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin front clip {{like the rest of}} the American line of the year. The [...] "258" [...] engine displacement emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units and the bumper guards were included free of extra charge. Power brakes were moved to the standard equipment list. Most of the light group was also installed as standard equipment; aside from the already existing courtesy <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> the hood light, trunk light and glove box light. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seat back got a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC's original factory air conditioning system for the first time became available as optional equipment. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, the National Christmas Tree was {{relocated}} to Lafayette Park {{north of the}} White House. The 1931 Norway spruce had again become damaged, and the National Park Service purchased two [...] "Koster" [...] blue spruce cultivars to plant {{on the west side}} of Sherman Square with the intent of using alternating between trees each year. But when it became clear later that year that the National Christmas Tree would have to be moved from Sherman Square, the agency asked the Commission of Fine Arts (which had partial jurisdiction over planting decisions around the White House) for permission to plant the two trees to the southeast and southwest of the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. [...] The Commission of Fine Arts opposed the plan, and suggested that two fir trees be planted east and west of the statue instead. For a time, the National Park Service hoped to plant two trees (of an undetermined species) on the Ellipse near the White House, but in the end acceded to the Commission of Fine Art's plan. Two [...] high Fraser firs from North Carolina were planted to the [...] east and west of the Jackson statue. The trees were planted just a few weeks before the tree lighting ceremony, and the western tree was chosen to begin the alternating use of the trees because it was more visible from the first family's living quarters. During the tree lighting ceremony, President Roosevelt drew attention to the statue of Andrew Jackson and asked the American people to be as courageous in the face of the depression as Jackson had been throughout his lifetime. The tree did not light when Roosevelt threw the switch. The tree remained unlit for about five seconds while Roosevelt worriedly looked about, but then the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> on.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Bogdanov's 1978 RSC {{production}} at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Jonathan Pryce and Paola Dionisotti. In this modern dress production, after the house lights went down, nothing happened on stage for a moment. Then, a commotion arose from within the audience. The house <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> back on, {{and a member of}} the audience (Pryce) is seen to be in altercation with an usherette (Dionisotti). After pushing the usherette to the ground, the man then clambered onto the stage, and began to smash parts of the set before being restrained by the usherette and theatre staff, stripped and thrown into a bath. The subsequent play was then presented as his dream. At several performances of the play, audience members were duped into thinking the fight between the man and the usherette was real, and several times, other audience members attempted to intervene in the conflict. This production very much embraced a feminist reading of the play, presenting the taming as a distasteful display of male chauvinism, with the process presented as Sly's dream of male domination and power over the usherette who had restrained him. In this version, Katherina delivers the final speech (with the men sitting not at a dining table but a poker table) in a toneless, lifeless voice, and although Petruchio appeared thoroughly ashamed of what he had done to her, he still collected his winnings from the other men before leaving. Dionisotti's own feelings about her delivery of the speech was that it was [...] "full of affection for women." [...] She also felt the production had a very bleak ending; [...] "the last image was of two very lonely people. The lights went down as we left - I following him, the others hardly noticing we'd gone. They'd got down to some hard gambling. They just closed ranks around the green baize table." [...] Michael Billington was especially complementary, praising Bogdanov for the honesty shown in [...] "his approach to this barbaric and disgusting play [...] Instead of softening its harsh edges like most recent directors, he has chosen to emphasise its moral and physical ugliness." [...] Graham Holderness argues of this production, [...] "Bogdanov was concerned to stress the continuities between the mercantile ethics of Renaissance Padua and the commercial values of modern-day British capitalism; between the oppression of women in Shakespeare's time, and the continuing exploitation of sex today; between the class-divisions of the sixteenth century and the economic inequality of the twentieth." ...|$|E
