5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you <b>look</b> <b>even</b> though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to <b>look</b> <b>even</b> more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed {{that he did not have}} the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to <b>look</b> <b>even</b> worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|Barlow {{returned}} {{the second half}} kickoff 58 yards to the Broncos 27, setting up Jags kicker Mike Hollis' 38-yard field goal that cut the score to 21-10. Four minutes later, safety Travis Davis blocked a punt from Denver's Tom Rouen and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, bringing Jacksonville to within 21-17. Despite a 51-yard kickoff return by Vaughn Hebron, things seemed to <b>look</b> <b>even</b> better for Jacksonville on the ensuing possession when safety Chris Hudson forced a fumble from Elway that was recovered by defensive end Renaldo Wynn. Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell's subsequent 37-yard completion to tight end Damon Jones gave them a first down on the Broncos 16-yard line. But on the next play, Brunell lost a fumble of his own that was recovered by linebacker Allen Aldridge. Denver then drove to the Jacksonville 15, featuring a 59-yard run by Davis, but Elway lost another fumble that was recovered by cornerback Dave Thomas and the score remained 21-17 going into the fourth quarter.|$|E

500|$|Samuel Beckett– Yoshihiko Ikegami {{considers}} Beckett's Waiting for Godot {{a parody}} of Noh, particularly Kami Noh, in which a god or a spirit appears before a secondary character as the protagonist.

500|$|Due {{to their}} vaguely {{anthropomorphic}} shape, dried skates {{have long been}} described as mermaids. [...] Often their appearance is deliberately modified to make them <b>look</b> <b>even</b> more human. [...] In Europe, dried skates, sometimes called devil fish, (not {{to be confused with}} devil fish or devil rays, two species of ray native to the north Atlantic) were displayed as mermaids, angels, demons, or basilisks. [...] In Britain they are known as Jenny Hanivers, perhaps in reference to Antwerp, where they were made by sailors. [...] Dried skates are also known in Mexico, where they are believed to have magical powers, and are used in healing rituals.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{live action}} was a {{stepping}} stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make {{the rest of the}} film <b>look</b> <b>even</b> more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then {{would not have been able}} to recognize how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because [...] "e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of." [...] The CEO says [...] "stay the course", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny. Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.|$|E

Ayane's portrayal by Natassia Malthe {{in the film}} DOA: Dead or Alive was panned by many fans and critics alike (even as, prior to the premiere, IGN stated that [...] "DOA is HOT... and Nastassia Malthe proves it"). Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar dubbed the motion picture version of Ayane as [...] "White Girl Who is Somehow Also Japanese", Roger Moore wrote in Orlando Sentinel that Malthe's purple hair [...] "makes her <b>look</b> <b>even</b> less Japanese than [...] Aoki", and UGO.com wrote about Malthe's role as Ayane: [...] "Defining Moment: Zzzzzzzz." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} his {{seagoing}} naval career Rupert {{continued to}} be actively involved in both government and science, although he was increasingly removed from current politics. To the younger members of the court the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. Count Grammont described Rupert as [...] "brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when he ought to have been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern <b>look,</b> <b>even</b> when he wished to please; but, when he was out of humour, he was the true picture of reproof". Rupert's health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful trepanning treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed {{a voice for}} Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that [...] "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time." [...] Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him <b>look</b> <b>even</b> more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as [...] "Frink noise".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, O'Neill was {{selected}} to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing {{in all of the}} matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing [...] "some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as [...] "sparkling" [...] and said that it made [...] "everything which had gone before <b>look</b> <b>even</b> more wretched". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said [...] "Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition". Wisden opined that O'Neill had [...] "saved a game that had been tortuous for days". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was [...] "unbelievable" [...] and that he was [...] "just about falling to sleep" [...] in the field.|$|E

500|$|... "Cherish" [...] was {{accompanied}} by a black-and-white music video that was directed by Herb Ritts and was filmed on July 22, 1989 at Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu, California. Its world premiere took place on MTV on August 28, 1989. Ritts was one of Madonna's preferred photographers at that time and so she asked him to direct the [...] "Cherish" [...] video. Ritts reportedly tried to talk her out of it by saying, [...] "But I'm a still photographer. I don't know anything about film." [...] Undaunted, Madonna replied simply, [...] "Well you have a few weeks to learn." [...] The video was conceptualized by Ritts, who wanted to portray mermen in their natural habitat, but Madonna baulked at the idea since she wanted to be portrayed as herself, but keep the mermen also. Four male performers were signed for this, one of them being Tony Ward, who would become Madonna's boyfriend later, with the other three being water polo players from nearby Pepperdine University. There were four merman tails created by Global Effects in North Hollywood, California for the video. Three full-size tails for the mermen were cast in a solid highly flexible rubber, each weighing around 40lbs. This was necessary to make them neutrally buoyant in water as lighter tails would have floated, causing the swimmers to be head-down in the sea. Once in these tails, the polo players needed to be carried to and from the water and once in it, they had tremendous swimming power and agility. This was partly due to a plastic spring-like armature cast into the flipper of each tail. One of the reasons this video was shot in black and white is because the water was very cold, causing Madonna's already pale complexion to <b>look</b> <b>even</b> whiter.|$|E
