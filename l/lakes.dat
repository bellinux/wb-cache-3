5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor <b>lakes</b> is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has <b>lakes</b> of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's <b>lakes</b> are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural <b>lakes</b> on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other <b>lakes</b> are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many <b>lakes</b> because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All <b>lakes</b> are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed <b>lakes</b> with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation <b>lakes</b> (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these <b>lakes.</b> The only Rove-typical east-west oriented <b>lakes</b> lying in Ontario are Arrow and North <b>lakes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great <b>Lakes</b> storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h).

It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial <b>lakes</b> may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial <b>lakes</b> of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual <b>lakes,</b> large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E

5|$|On 2 May, the Serb Democratic Party, {{the ruling}} party in the SAO Krajina, {{organised}} a protest march to the Plitvice <b>Lakes</b> and a political rally demanding the Croatian police withdraw from Plitvice.

The JNA imposed a blockade of the Plitvice <b>Lakes</b> police station on 1 July, on the pretext that the Croatian police had abducted and imprisoned two JNA officers. By 6 July, the SAO Krajina forces and the JNA commenced attacks on the Ljubovo Pass southeast of the Plitvice <b>Lakes,</b> on the Titova Korenica–Gospić road, driving the Croatian National Guard back and capturing the pass {{by the end of}} the month. Throughout the summer, the JNA continued to engage Croatian forces in Lika using the units deployed to the Plitvice <b>Lakes</b> in April.

Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
