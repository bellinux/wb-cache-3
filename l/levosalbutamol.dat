50|$|<b>Levosalbutamol,</b> {{also known}} as levalbuterol, is a short-acting β2 {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist used {{in the treatment of}} asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence does not show that <b>levosalbutamol</b> works better than salbutamol, thus there may not be sufficient justification for prescribing it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Levosalbutamol's</b> {{bronchodilator}} properties give it indications {{in treatment}} of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {{also known as}} chronic obstructive lung disease) and asthma. Like other bronchodilators, it acts by relaxing smooth muscle in the bronchial tubes, and thus shortening or reversing an acute [...] "attack" [...] of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Unlike some slower-acting bronchodilators, it is not indicated as a preventative of chronic bronchial constriction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Levosalbutamol</b> {{has similar}} {{pharmacokinetic}} and pharmacodynamic properties to salbutamol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levosalbutamol</b> is the INN while levalbuterol is the USAN.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levosalbutamol</b> relaxes {{the smooth}} muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the {{terminal}} bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways. <b>Levosalbutamol</b> acts as a functional agonist that relaxes the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thereby protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>levosalbutamol</b> is well tolerated. Common mild {{side-effects}} {{include an}} elevated heart rate, muscle cramps, and gastric upset (including heartburn and diarrhea).|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundSalbutamol, {{the most}} widely used short-acting β 2 -agonist, {{consists}} of a racemic mixture of equal amounts of two enantiomers, (R) -salbutamol and (S) -salbutamol. The bronchodilator effects of salbutamol are attributed entirely to (R) -salbutamol (<b>levosalbutamol),</b> while (S) -salbutamol has been shown to possess bronchospastic and pro-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo studies. <b>Levosalbutamol,</b> the (R) -enantiomer of salbutamol is currently available only in a liquid formulation for use via a nebulizer. Recently, <b>levosalbutamol</b> to be administered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) has been developed. AimsTo compare the time-dependent bronchodilator responses of single doses of 100 mcg <b>levosalbutamol</b> and 200 mcg racemic salbutamol administered via a pMDI in subjects with stable mild-to-moderate bronchial asthma over a period of 6 h. MethodsSingle doses of 100 mcg <b>levosalbutamol,</b> 200 mcg salbutamol and placebo were administered with a pMDI in 30 stable asthmatic subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross over study. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured at baseline, and over 6 h post-study drug administration. ResultsLevosalbutamol and salbutamol produced significantly better bronchodilator responses than placebo. Both the drugs showed equivalent time-dependent bronchodilator responses as measured by area under curve for percent change in FEV 1 and FVC over 6 h. The time to onset of action, mean maximum bronchodilator response and duration of bronchodilator response were similar between <b>levosalbutamol</b> and salbutamol. ConclusionA single dose of 100 mcg <b>levosalbutamol</b> administered by a pMDI produced a similar bronchodilator response as salbutamol when measured over 6 h in subjects with stable, mild-tomoderate bronchial asthma...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerability of oral racemic salbutamol and <b>levosalbutamol</b> {{in patients with}} mild bronchial asthma. a single blind trial was designed {{to find out the}} usefulness of the tablet racemic salbutamol (2 mg) and <b>levosalbutamol</b> (1 mg) given independently to 25 matched mild bronchial asthma cases who satisfied a rigid inclusion and exclusion criteria at three times daily dosage over a period of 15 days. They were assessed objectively before and after by peak flow meter and serum potassium; and subjectively by palpitation, cough, breathlessness, and wheeze. Data were analysed statistically. The mean peak expiratory flow rate before and after therapy in racemic salbutamol group was 227. 50 and 248 ml respectively and in <b>levosalbutamol</b> group 231 and 282. 5 ml respectively with significant improvement in both but more in latter. No significant difference in serum potassium level either in intra or in inter group was noticed. Tachycardia, tremor, and muscular cramps were significantly low in <b>levosalbutamol</b> group. <b>Levosalbutamol</b> was found to be superior to salbutamol in terms of efficacy and tolerability in patients with mild bronchial asthma as evidenced by subjective and objective means.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the efficacy and safety of racemic salbutamol with <b>levosalbutamol</b> in patients of bronchial asthma Methods: A prospective, randomized, open label 8 weeks study. After taking informed consent of 100 patients of either sex were randomly divided in to racemic salbutamol (group A) and <b>levosalbutamol</b> (group B) group of 50 patients each. At first visit (0 week) Spirometry parameters like FEV 1, FVC, PEFR and heart rate changes were recorded before and 20 minutes after drug administration via MDI. Patients were prescribed the study drug for further 4 weeks for safety assessment. At 4 weeks spirometry parameters and heart rate changes were recorded before and 20 minutes after drug administration. At both the visits patients were interviewed for side effects. Results were analysed at 0 and 4 weeks. Result: At 0 and 4 weeks mean percentage increase of FEV 1, FVC, PEFR in <b>levosalbutamol</b> group after drug administration was significantly higher. Conclusion: <b>Levosalbutamol</b> was found to be more efficacious and safer than racemic salbutamol...|$|E
40|$|Plan: An {{analytical}} method for estimation of <b>levosalbutamol</b> in bulk and pharmaceutical formulation. Preface: The developed method is simple, fast and accurate {{and can be}} used for routine analysis of Market formulations. Methodology: In this study zero, first and second order derivative spectrophotometric method were developed for the estimation of <b>Levosalbutamol</b> sulphate. In zero order spectrophotometery, absorbance value was measured at 277 nm. In first derivative spectrophotometry amplitudes were measured at 233 nm. In second derivative spectrophotometry amplitudes were measured at 237 nm. Calibration curves were linear between the concentration range of 20 - 60 µg/ml, 5 - 30 µg/ml and 35 - 60 µg/ml respectively. The % RSD value is less than 2 % and the recovery were near 100 % for all methods. Outcome: All the developed methods were applied on pharmaceutical formulations.

40|$|A novel, simple, {{accurate}} and precise RP-HPLC method for simultaneous determination of <b>levosalbutamol</b> sulfate and theophylline {{has been developed}} and validated. Separation was achieved on a Phenomenex; C 18 column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 µm) using methanol: 10 mM TBAHS(tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate) (50 : 50, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate of 1. 0 mL. min- 1. The UV detection wavelength was 274 nm. The linearity is obeyed over a concentration range of 0. 5 - 150 µg. mL- 1 with correlation coefficient of 0. 999 for both the drugs. The proposed method was validated by determining accuracy, precision, stability and system suitability parameters. The method {{was found to be}} robust. Specificity of the method was determined by subjecting the drugs to various stress conditions like acid, alkali, oxidation, thermal and photolytic degradation. The method was used successfully for the simultaneous determination of <b>levosalbutamol</b> sulfate and theophylline in syrup dosage form...|$|E
40|$|Most {{new drugs}} are marketed as single enantiomers but many older agents are still {{available}} in racemic form. As these drugs {{reach the end of}} their patent life manufacturers become interested in marketing single enantiomer equivalents. This is called ‘chiral switching’ and it has been claimed that it will bring clinical benefits in terms of improved efficacy, more predictable pharmacokinetics or reduced toxicity. We reviewed the clinical evidence and prices for three recently marketed single enantiomer versions of widely used racemic drugs: escitalopram, esomeprazole and <b>levosalbutamol.</b> Claims of increased efficacy were based on comparisons of non-equivalent doses and any advantages seemed small and clinically unimportant. Prices of esomeprazole and <b>levosalbutamol</b> were higher than their racemic alternatives and we predict that these prices will remain high despite the market presence of generic versions of the racemates. Patent protection and a perception of superiority based on promotion rather than evidence will maintian price premiums for single enantiomer drugs that are not justified on the basis of clinical performance.

40|$|Areas covered: In {{this review}} the authors show that (R) -salbutamol alone (generically known as <b>levosalbutamol)</b> {{provides}} beneficial beta beta(2) -agonist effects at a cellular level and in experimental models of airways disease. In addition the authors demonstrate that (S) -salbutamol opposes the desirable effects of (R) -salbutamol and can actually cause features of asthma and COPD in vitro and in experimental asthma. Expert opinion: Despite this strong body of experimental evidence, (R) -salbutamol has not shown consistent superiority over (S) - or racemic salbutamol in human asthma or COP...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the drugs}} {{currently}} used in medical practice are mixtures of enantiomers (racemates). Many a times, the two enantiomers differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Replacing existing racemates with single isomers has resulted in improved safety and/or efficacy profile of various racemates. In this review, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic implications of chirality are discussed in brief, followed by an overview of some important chiral switches that have yielded safer alternatives. These include <b>levosalbutamol,</b> S-ketamine, levobupivacaine, S-zopiclone, levocetirizine, S-amlodipine, S-atenolol, S-metoprolol, S-omeprazole, S-pantoprazole and R-ondansetron.

40|$|Four simple, rapid, accurate, precise, {{reliable}} and economical spectrophotometric {{methods have been}} proposed for simultaneous determination of ambroxol, guaiphenesin and <b>levosalbutamol</b> sulphate, in pure and pharmaceutical formulations without any prior separation or purification step. The methods are first derivative zero crossing spectrophotometry, simultaneous equation, derivative ratio spectra zero crossing and double divisor ratio spectra derivative method. Developed methods show best results in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD and LOQ for standard laboratory mixtures of pure drugs and marketed formulations. Common excipients and additives did not interfere in determinations of these APIs. Results obtained by the proposed methods have been statistically compared by means of student t-test...|$|E
40|$|Mucoadhesive drug {{delivery}} systems {{are those that}} provide intimate contact of the drug with the mucosa {{for an extended period}} of time. In present work, mucoadhesive chitosan microspheres of <b>Levosalbutamol</b> sulphate were prepared by Spray drying method. Formulations were characterized for various physicochemical attributes size, encapsulation efficiency, swelling ability, in vitro release study and mucoadhesion study by rat ileum. Through these parameters we conclude that the batch B 2 was found to be best mainly by mucoadhesion study and in vitro drug release. Mucoadhesion was found to be increased with incresed concentration of polymer and visa versa in case of drug release. Batch B 3 had also similar results with that of Batch B 2. That′s why here Batch B 2 was said to be the best batch with less polymeric content as compare to Batch B 3...|$|E
40|$|Asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common non-communicable {{diseases}} in the world, affecting almost 4 % of the world's population. The cause behind asthma is not understood, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. This is a condition that is affecting more and more people, especially in developing countries, where medication is less available. There are many different treatments to manage this chronic inflammation of the airways; β 2 adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids or synthetic antibodies, but during an acute asthma attack the short-acting β 2 adrenergic receptor agonists (SABAs) are the most effective. The most commonly used SABA is marketed under the name Ventoline, with the active compound being a racemic mixture of salbutamol. It is commonly known that salbuta-mol has one active enantiomer and one inactive enantiomer, but it has been debated whether the medicine with the pure active enantiomer is worth its increase in cost. This thesis focuses on exploring the possibilities for a biocatalytic approach in the synthesis of the clinically active enantiomer, <b>levosalbutamol,</b> in an attempt to reduce the waste and cost of the industrial synthesis. This topic has been approached previously by Camilla Skjærpe in her master thesis, on which this thesis is based. Using her work as a foundation, the synthetic route from salicylaldehyde to <b>levosalbutamol</b> was evaluated, and the biocatalytic use of Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA) was in-corporated. The first reaction, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, gave a decent yield (34. 9 %) and high purity. The second step was a reduction, where both LiAlH 4 and S. cerevisiae was at-tempted. The chemical reduction had a lot of room for improvement and the yeast reduction was promising, but the complete workup was missing. Using LiAlH 4 required enzymatic reso-lution with CALA, which yielded very poor results. The next and last step would be amination with t-butyl amine, but this step was not done due to time constraints combined with difficulties in the workup of the preceding step...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare health {{expenditures}} among elderly Medicaid {{patients with}} asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) who used either nebulized levalbuterol (<b>levosalbutamol)</b> or racemic albuterol (salbutamol) for bronchodilation. Methods: A retrospective, quasi-experimental study was conducted. Trends {{over time in}} total medical expenditures and disease-specific expenditures were compared for levalbuterol versus racemic albuterol patients. Differences in these trends were estimated by conducting generalized estimating equation regression analyses of difference-in-difference regression models. Prior to comparing levalbuterol and racemic albuterol users, these models controlled for their differences in demographics, reason for Medicaid eligibility, location, health-plan type, co-morbidities, severity of asthma or COPD, the use of other medications, and the receipt of influenza or pneumonia inoculations. Several sensitivity analyses were also conducted to estimate the reliability of the results, as related to inclusion criteria (e. g. days of therapy), regression methods, or to conduct separate analyses for asthma and COPD patients. Results: When asthma and COPD patients were pooled, every analysis of total healthcare expenditures showed large, statistically significant savings associated with levalbuterol use. These savings ranged from $US 1167 to $US 1792 per patient over a 6 -month period, depending on inclusion criteria or statistical methods. When the analyses were separated by disease, a focus on total health expenditures still favored levalbuterol and the savings associated with levalbuterol use were about twice as high per patient for COPD patients ($US 2490) as they were for asthma patients ($US 1122). A focus on disease-related expenditures showed a statistically significant loss of approximately $US 853 per patient for levalbuterol users who had asthma (p = 0. 0031) but a statistically significant saving of approximately $US 967 for COPD patients who used levalbuterol (p = 0. 0031). Conclusions: A focus on total medical expenditures showed that the added costs of using levalbuterol were more than offset by reductions in other types of healthcare expenditures. Savings were higher for COPD patients than for asthma patients. A focus on disease-related expenditures showed savings for COPD patients who used levalbuterol, but results for asthma patients favored racemic albuterol.

40|$|Objectives: To {{analyze the}} {{pharmacological}} management of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized pediatric patients. The economic {{burden of the}} disease and the adverse drug reactions occurring during the course of treatment have also been studied. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective, longitudinal, and observational study, carried out over a period of one-and-a-half years. The patients, aged one month to twelve years, diagnosed with respiratory tract infections (RTI), as confirmed by a pediatrician, were enrolled. Modified Kunin's criteria along with the guidelines set by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) were followed for assessing the appropriateness of the antibacterials prescribed. The adverse drug reactions occurring {{during the course of the}} treatment were noted and the economic burden of the disease was calculated as direct and indirect costs. Results: A total of 201 patients were enrolled, of whom 46 % were in the age group of one month to one year. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia (76 %). The number of drugs and antibacterials prescribed per patient were 4. 88 ± 1. 57 and 1. 85 ± 0. 86, respectively. Antibacterials (37. 7 %), intravenous fluids (17. 2 %), respiratory medicines (16. 6 %), and analgesic/antipyretics (16. 5 %) were the common drug groups prescribed. Among the antibacterials, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (47 %) and cefotaxime (22 %) were frequently prescribed. Appropriate antibacterial therapy was given in 42 % of the cases. Salbutamol and a combination of <b>Levosalbutamol</b> and Ipratropium Bromide were the commonly prescribed respiratory medicines. Three adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed in indoor patients, all due to antibacterials. The economic burden of the disease was calculated to be Rs. 4925. 14 or US$ 109. 9 per patient. Conclusion: An overuse of antibacterials and respiratory medicines was seen in the study. Emphasis on proper diagnosis and treatment, education and availability of locally effective guidelines may help in a better and judicious use of drugs in children...|$|E
