5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove <b>Lane</b> park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the junction of Grove <b>Lane</b> and Pingate <b>Lane,</b> was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight <b>Lane</b> and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss <b>Lane</b> also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E

5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place.

5|$|For sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400m relay and {{the indoor}} 400metres), each athlete must run the race within their {{allocated}} <b>lane</b> {{from start to}} finish. If an athlete leaves their <b>lane</b> or steps on the line demarking each <b>lane</b> the athlete will be disqualified. <b>Lane</b> rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, {{the beginning of the}} 800m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.|$|E
5000|$|Managed <b>lanes</b> are an {{important}} part of step-by-step implementation of the regional transportation vision. Managed <b>lanes</b> are commonly referred to as [...] "express lanes", where operational strategies such as pricing, vehicle eligibility, and/or access control are implemented to regulate demand and utilize available capacity. Examples of managed <b>lanes</b> include toll <b>lanes,</b> reversible <b>lanes,</b> value priced <b>lanes,</b> and high-occupancy vehicle <b>lanes.</b> The TBARTA Managed <b>Lanes</b> network includes the existing toll facilities in our region as well as a mid-term and long-term network of managed <b>lanes</b> identified by the TBARTA Master Plan and by FDOT.|$|R

The {{work on the}} {{westbound}} <b>lanes</b> was completed in late-October 2014, with the eastbound <b>lanes</b> completed in mid-November 2014. Highway 417 was also expanded to 8 <b>lanes</b> between Moodie Drive and Eagleson Road/March Road to relieve congestion, especially when events occur at Canadian Tire Centre.|$|R
5|$|From 1976 to 1977, <b>Lane</b> {{appeared}} in The Cherry Orchard and Agamemnon at New York's Vivian Beaumont Theater. After {{participating in the}} first production of Runaways when it was off-Broadway, <b>Lane</b> took a decade-long hiatus from theatre. In 1989, <b>Lane</b> returned to the stage to play Olivia in Twelfth Night at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. <b>Lane</b> took another hiatus from theatre until 2012, when she starred opposite Finn Wittrock in Sweet Bird of Youth at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago (directed by David Cromer). <b>Lane</b> then returned to New York theatre and starred off-Broadway in Bathsheba Doran's The Mystery of Love and Sex in 2015 (alongside Tony Shalhoub) and in Broadway's revival of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard in 2016 (alongside Joel Grey and Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of Covent Garden, with Drury <b>Lane</b> to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's <b>Lane</b> to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's <b>Lane</b> and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's <b>Lane</b> to Drury <b>Lane.</b> Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E

To the surprise and shock of the other partners, <b>Lane</b> responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and <b>Lane</b> exchange blows until <b>Lane</b> wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort <b>Lane,</b> only <b>Lane</b> misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave.

A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four <b>lane</b> extension from Davis Drive to Green <b>Lane</b> and the reconstruction of Green <b>Lane</b> into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.|$|E

50|$|Between {{interchanges}} Holendrecht and Oudenrijn, {{the road}} has been widened from six (2x3) to ten (2x5) <b>lanes.</b> It has enough space {{to expand the}} road to fourteen (2x7) <b>lanes.</b> Near the city of Utrecht, a system of local-express <b>lanes</b> has been applied, with the inner three <b>lanes</b> serving express traffic, and the outer two <b>lanes</b> serving local traffic.

5000|$|Additionally, {{different}} terminology is used {{to identify}} traffic <b>lanes</b> in a multi-lane roadway. North American usage calls the <b>lanes</b> located closest to the roadway centerline the [...] "inner" [...] <b>lanes,</b> while British usage calls these <b>lanes</b> the [...] "outer" [...] <b>lanes.</b> Thus, it is less confusing to call these central <b>lanes</b> the [...] "passing", [...] "fast", or [...] "overtaking" [...] <b>lanes</b> in international contexts, instead of using the ambiguous inner/outer distinction. Regional differences between right-hand traffic and left-hand traffic can cause further confusion.|$|R
