40|$|The “charterer’s {{liability}} insurance” {{is a type}} {{of marine}} insurance. Most ships are chartered either on a time charter or voyage charter contract. In both cases the charterer assumes liabilities towards the shipowner because of damage caused to the ship in the course of cargo-handling or because of damage resulting from an unsafe port or berth. And also, the charterer becomes liable similarly to the shipowner, with P&I liability to cargo, pollution claims and etc. All charterers require cover for both damage to hull and other P&I liabilities. The so-called “charterer’s liability insurance” provides coverage for such risks. I choose charterer’s liability insurance as the topic mostly because of the fast development of chartering ships in the market and the large number of disputes arising thereof. During my research, I found that there might be disputes arising out of the charter party, most of which is in relation to the damage to ships and general average after the casualties. The disputes become a major problem facing the charterer if he does not have a charterer’s liability insurance policy or he did not rightly enter such a policy. Moreover, the disputes may hinder the development of shipping market. In international P&I associations like Sculd and Gard, quite a number of vessels are enterers on the basis of charterer’s entry. To better understand this particular type of insurance and to discover certain practical problems about it, I will discuss sup-topics in the following chapters: Legal Sources (chapter 2), Charterer’s Risks (chapter 3), Overview of Charterer’s Liability Insurance Policy (chapter 4), Liability Cover (chapter 5), General Average Cover (chapter 6), <b>Legal</b> <b>Expenses</b> <b>Cover</b> (chapter 7) and Exclusions and Limitations of Coverage (chapter 8). For this mission, this thesis will adopt the comparative method by comparing the legislation and P&I Association rules of China, Norway and England, and by referring to different charter parties, different charterer’s liability insurance policies and several cases. The differences in relation to charterer’s liability insurance such as the legal framework, the cover of risks insured and limitation of risk between countries can be found anywhere especially when you are trying to make them clear by comparing eastern laws like China with western systems like Norway and U. K. However the situation is changing with the globalization...|$|E

40|$|The subject. Nowadays {{a variety}} of civil law studies {{actively}} discusses the issues of insurance regulation. However, <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance is unknown to Russian legal doctrine and practice. The research focuses on <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance. The purpose of the article is to reveal a potential that legal and economic instruments have in comparison to other guarantees of unobstructed enjoyment of the rights and legitimate interests. The methodology. It is a comparative law approach that allows to describe the peculiarities of <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance in foreign countries, outline the criteria to match the existing models, determine their similarities and differences as well as benefits and drawbacks. Economic analysis of law is helpful to evaluate the convenience of a new tool for citizens and its influence {{on the level of}} their <b>legal</b> <b>expenses.</b> The results, scope of it’s application. As a result, the article argues that <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance improves the financial accessibility of qualified legal assistance and stimulates legal activity, since it does not impose any formal restrictions on the clients, the content of the contract or the sphere of its application. Meanwhile, the research formulates and characterizes some difficulties that may occur in the course of introduction of this institution to Russian law. Primarily, such obstacles include the low level of insurance culture, the need of significant amendments to legislation in force and the lack of professional expertise in this field. Despite different political and legal obstacles, it is necessary to create an effective model of <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance in Russia in order to improve Russian legal system and form the culture of getting legal services in time. Conclusions. The insurance mechanisms provide citizens with an opportunity to minimize their legal and financial risks connected to unforeseeable situations, which require covering costs of professional legal assistance. The authors conclude that <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance is able to become an additional guarantee to the right to qualified legal assistance in case of appropriate adaptation to current conditions of Russian legal life and legal mechanisms.  </p...|$|R

40|$|The risks {{involved}} in litigation are well documented; {{they include the}} risk of incurring <b>legal</b> <b>expenses.</b> While much literature focuses on contingent fees as a mechanism for litigants to shift this risk, there is little work on <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance—the dominant means of shifting this risk in Europe. In our model, a risk averse plaintiff may purchase <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> insurance. The defendant makes a single settlement offer but is uninformed about the plaintiff’s degree of risk aversion. We investigate the effects of insurance cover on settlement amounts, settlement probabilities, the volume of accidents and the ex ante volume of trials. We also investigate the insurance decision. We find that more insurance hardens the plaintiff’s negotiating stance and increases the defendant’s level of care, but that the overall effects on other variables of interest depend on the plaintiff’s risk aversion. Insurance can increase or decrease ex ante welfare...|$|R
