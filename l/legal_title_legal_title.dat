5000|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>title</b> is actual {{ownership}} of the property as when the property has been bought, the seller paid in full and a deed or title is properly recorded. Equitable <b>title</b> separates from <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> upon {{the death of the}} <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> holder (owner). For example: When a person having <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to property dies, heirs at law or beneficiaries per the last will, automatically receive equitable interest in the property. When an executor or administrator qualifies, that person acquires <b>legal</b> <b>title,</b> subject to divestment when the estate has been administered so as to allow for the lawful passing of the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to those having an equitable interest. The resulting merger of the legal and equitable gives rise to [...] "perfect title," [...] often referred to as marketable title.|$|R
5000|$|In law, {{conveyancing}} is {{the transfer}} of <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> of real property {{from one person to}} another, or the granting of an encumbrance such as a mortgage or a lien. A typical conveyancing transaction has two major phases: the exchange of contracts (when equitable interests are created) and completion (also called settlement, when <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> passes and equitable rights merge with the <b>legal</b> <b>title).</b>|$|R
50|$|Consignment shops {{differ from}} charity or thrift shops {{in which the}} {{original}} owners surrender both physical possession and <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the item as a charitable donation, and the seller retains all proceeds from the sale. They also differ from pawn shops in which the original owner can surrender physical possession (but not <b>legal</b> <b>title)</b> of the item {{in exchange for a}} loan and then reclaim the item upon repayment of the loan with interest (or else surrender <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the item), or alternatively can surrender both physical possession and <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> for an immediate payment; the pawn shop would retain all proceeds from any subsequent sale.|$|R
5000|$|Beneficial {{owner is}} a legal term where {{specific}} property rights ("use and title") in equity belong to a person even though <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> of the property belongs to another person.

40|$|Abstract—Legal {{transfer}} of electronic title document across heterogeneous contexts is a challenging research problem in e-commerce and implies a wider e-commerce transaction scope. This kind of title transfer requires semantic consistency, confidentiality, integrity and legality between transferor and transferee. During the title transfer, cross-context semantic consistency {{must first be}} maintained between electronic <b>title</b> documents for <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> transfer while other requirements are considered. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a Cross-Context E-Title (CCET) approach, which satisfies the requirements for title transfer. Based on CCET approach, a CCET prototype is further implemented, on which some experiments are made to test the correctness and performance of the proposed approach. I I...|$|R

50|$|Jus tertii (Latin, “third party rights”) is {{the legal}} {{classification}} for an argument made by a third party (as opposed to the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> holder) which attempts to justify entitlement to possessory rights based on the showing of <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> in another person. By showing legitimate title in another person, jus tertii arguments imply that the present possessor’s interest is illegitimate or that the present possessor is a thief.|$|R

50|$|Although Garcia {{believed}} he owned {{virtually all of}} Point Reyes, another Point Reyes land grant was awarded the same year, 1836. It was given to an Irishman James Berry who had become a Mexican citizen and colonel in the army. This land grant {{was also in the}} Olema Valley, and, to add to the boundary confusion, he soon left the area and hired Garcia to oversee it. A mere two years later Berry sold nearly 9,000 acres of it to a sea captain, Joseph Snook, an act clearly prohibited by Mexican law and grounds for forfeiture of the entire grant. Although Berry understandably wanted to keep the sale secret, Snook wanted <b>legal</b> <b>title.</b> He discovered that {{the only way he could}} obtain <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> of the land he had illegally purchased was to formally denounce Berry's ownership on the grounds that he had never occupied it. He was successful and gained <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the land he had illegally purchased, stocked it with 56 head of cattle, and, like Berry, hired Garcia to oversee it. Three months after he won <b>legal</b> <b>title,</b> he illegally sold it.|$|R

Even though today there is bigger and bigger demand for this transaction, legislation is not very well adapted to that. Medical practice can be perceived as undertaking pursuant to § 502 civil code. Because of that, {{it is possible to}} sell it (besides other ways) based on <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> business purchase contract pursuant to § 2175 civil code. <b>Legal</b> <b>title</b> business purchase contract is in practice used often, nevertheless whole process of purchase of medical practice based on <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> business purchase contract is not smooth. I would like to highlight the problems which can emerge. It is possible to divide this work into two parts. The first part deals with legal definitions and legal analysis of basic legal terms as undertaking, medical practice, provider of medical assistance services. We can find here also justification why it is possible to perceive medical practice as undertaking. The second part is focused on business purchase contract in general with specifics, which can arise in case of purchase of medical practice based on <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> business purchase contract. In second chapter (after the introduction), I define in general the concept of undertaking and I also [...] ...|$|R

Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|R
