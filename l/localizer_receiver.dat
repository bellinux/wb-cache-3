50|$|Antenna system AS-27/ARN-5 is {{used with}} the dual {{installation}} of the localizer and glide path receivers. Antenna AN-100 is used when only the <b>localizer</b> <b>receiver</b> is installed in the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The RC-103-A is an {{airborne}} <b>localizer</b> <b>receiver</b> used {{to indicate}} a landing course {{in conjunction with the}} AAF instrument approach system. signals received from a transmitter, located {{at one end of the}} runway to be used, are fed into the cross-pointer indicator to indicate [...] "on course", [...] "fly right" [...] or [...] "fly left". Audio indication is also provided.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{autoland}} system {{consists of}} an ILS (integrated glideslope receiver, <b>localizer</b> <b>receiver,</b> and perhaps GPS receiver as well) radio to receive the localizer and glideslope signals. The output of this radio will be a [...] "deviation" [...] from center which is provided to the flight control computer; this computer which controls the aircraft control surfaces to maintain the aircraft centered on the localizer and glideslope. The flight control computer also controls the aircraft throttles to maintain the appropriate approach speed. At the appropriate height above the ground (as indicated by the radio altimeter) the flight control computer will retard the throttles and initiate a pitch-up maneuver. The purpose of this [...] "flare" [...] {{is to reduce the}} energy of the aircraft such that it [...] "stops flying" [...] and settles onto the runway.|$|E
40|$|A joint NASA/FAA {{flight test}} {{has been made}} to record {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) <b>localizer</b> <b>receiver</b> signals for use in mathematically modeling the ILS localizer for future simulation studies and airplane flight tracking tasks. The flight test was conducted on a portion of the ILS localizer installed on runway 25 L at the Los Angeles International Airport. The tests covered the range from 10 to 32 n. mi. from the localizer antenna. Precision radar tracking information was compared with the recorded localizer deviation data. Data analysis showed that the ILS signal centerline was offset to the left of runway centerline by 0. 071 degrees and that no significant bends existed on the localizer beam. Suggested simulation models for the ILS localizer are formed from a statistical analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} expected position errors encountered from LORAN-C during a non precision approach was formulated. From this, position error ellipses were generated that corresponded to two time difference correction schemes. One involved relaying corrections to the pilot just before he initiated the approach, and the other involved publishing time difference corrections in the instrument approach plates. It {{was found that the}} errors associated with both update scenarios were well within FAA AC 90 - 45 A accuracy standards for non precision approaches. The former scenario showed a significant improvement over the latter. Flight tests were conducted in a general aviation airplane carrying an equipment test bed designed to take data from a LORAN-C receiver and an ILS <b>localizer</b> <b>receiver.</b> The results of the flight tests show that the LORAN-C had a maximum error (average plus one standard deviation) of 1. 276 degrees deviation from the localizer path, and an average error (average plus one standard deviation) of. 648 degrees. It is concluded that LORAN-C is a suitable navigation system for non precision approaches and that time difference corrections made every eight weeks in the instrument approach plates will produce acceptable errors.
