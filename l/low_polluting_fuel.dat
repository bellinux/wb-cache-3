40|$|BACKGROUND: Consequences of {{exposure}} to household air pollution (HAP) from biomass fuels used for cooking on neonatal deaths and stillbirths is poorly understood. In a large multi-country observational study, we examined whether exposure to HAP was associated with perinatal mortality (stillbirths from gestation week 20 and deaths through day 7 of life) as well as when the deaths occurred (macerated, non-macerated stillbirths, very early neonatal mortality (day 0 - 2) and later neonatal mortality (day 3 - 28). Questions addressing household fuel use were asked at pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal follow-up visits in a prospective cohort study of pregnant women in rural communities in five low and lower middle income countries participating in the Global Network for Women and Children's Health's Maternal and Newborn Health Registry. The study was conducted between May 2011 and October 2012. <b>Polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> included kerosene, charcoal, coal, wood, straw, crop waste and dung. Clean fuels included electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and biogas. RESULTS: We studied the outcomes of 65, 912 singleton pregnancies, 18 % from households using clean fuels (59 % LPG) and 82 % from households using <b>polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> (86 % wood). Compared to households cooking with clean fuels, there was {{an increased risk of}} perinatal mortality among households using <b>polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 30 - 1. 61). Exposure to HAP increased the risk of having a macerated stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1. 66, 95 %CI 1. 23 - 2. 25), non-macerated stillbirth (aOR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 15 - 1. 85) and very early neonatal mortality (aOR 1. 82, 95 % CI 1. 47 - 2. 22). CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal mortality was associated with exposure to HAP from week 20 of pregnancy through at least day 2 of life. Since pregnancy losses before labor and delivery are difficult to track, the effect {{of exposure}} to <b>polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> on global perinatal mortality may have previously been underestimated.

According to Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell, LPG imports in the country has increased 23% during the financial year 2016-2017 to about 11 million tonnes. The main reason behind {{the increase in the}} consumption of LPG in India is due to the two government schemes coupled with free gas connections. From May 2016, the government is providing free cooking gas connections to women from extremely poor households, to reduce the use of <b>polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> such as wood and dried cow dung.

HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to ARIs. Little data exists on the incidence and cofactors of ARIs in HIV-infected infants receiving early antiretroviral therapy (ART). Household air pollution from wood (high polluting), charcoal, or kerosene (both medium <b>polluting)</b> <b>fuel</b> may also exacerbate risk of ARIs in HIV-infected children compared to exposure to petroleum gas (<b>low</b> <b>polluting).</b> We examined the burden of fuel use and HIV infection on ARI risk in HIV-infected infants receiving ART. Methods: HIV-infected infants initiated ART at ≤ 12 months of age and were followed monthly for 2 years in Nairobi, Kenya. AT 4 - 6 years post-ART initiation, fuel exposure was collected on the survivors within this cohort. ARI rates and cofactors were determined using Andersen-Gill models. Results: Among 111 HIV-infected infants (49 % male) initiating ART, the median age at ART initiation was 4. 5 months. Pre-ART, the median CD 4 % was 19 % and HIV- 1 RNA was 6. 6 log 10 copies/ml. Most infants (29 %) were wasted (weight-for-height Z-score <- 2). At 2 -years post-ART, upper respiratory infection (URI) and pneumonia rates were 118. 9 and 32. 7 per 100 person-years, respectively. In univariate analyses, lower monthly rent (< 1000 Kenya Shillings), higher plasma HIV-RNA level (per 1 log 10 copies/ml increase) and wasting were associated with pneumonia (hazard ratio (HR) = 3. 62; p= 0. 0001; HR= 1. 91; p = 0. 01 and HR= 2. 82; p= 0. 001, respectively), and these associations remained in adjusted models (HIV RNA, p= 0. 1; wasting, p= 0. 07; rent, p= 0. 01). At 2 -years post-ART, URI and pneumonia rates in those infants for whom fuel exposure data were collected (N= 45) were 122. 2 and 15. 6 per 100 person-years respectively. Of these infants, 4. 1 % had wood, 64. 6 % had charcoal and/or kerosene, and 30. 4 % had liquid petroleum gas exposure, which was often used in combination with higher <b>polluting</b> <b>fuels.</b> In univariate analysis, lower monthly rent was associated with pneumonia (HR= 7; p= 0. 02). Wood exposure was associated with higher risk of URI (HR= 1. 74; p = 0. 004). Conclusions: In early treated HIV-infected infants, lower monthly rent, and wasting prior to ART were independent risk factors for pneumonia, and infants with wood exposure had higher URI. Future effective strategies need to be implemented to decrease this ARI risk in HIV-infected infants...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the long run demand for energy-related environmental quality, its influence on legislation and on transitions to <b>low</b> <b>polluting</b> energy sources.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a <b>low</b> <b>polluting</b> alternative transportation <b>fuel</b> that could help improve urban air quality. This paper examines {{the potential impact of}} introducing a hydrogen-based transportation system on urban ambient ozone concentrations. This paper considers two scenarios, where significant numbers of new hydrogen vehicles are added to a constant number of gasoline vehicles. In our scenarios hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are introduced in Sacramento, California at market penetrations of 9 % and 20 %. From a life cycle analysis (LCA) perspective, considering all the emissions involved in producing, transporting, and using hydrogen, this research compares three hypothetical natural gas to hydrogen pathways: (1) on-site hydrogen production; (2) central hydrogen production with pipeline delivery; and (3) central hydrogen production with liquid hydrogen truck delivery. Using a regression model, this research shows that the daily maximum temperature correlates well with atmospheric ozone formation. However, increases in initial VOC and NOx concentrations do not necessarily increase the peak ozone concentration, and may even cause it to decrease. It is found that ozone formation is generally limited by NOx in the summer and is mostly limited by VOC in the fall in Sacramento. Of the three hydrogen pathways, the truck delivery pathway contributes the most to ozone precursor emissions. Ozone precursor emissions from the truck pathway at 9 % market penetration can cause additional 3 -h average VOC (or NOx) concentrations up to approximately 0. 05 % (or 1 %) of current pollution levels, and at 20 % market penetration up to approximately 0. 1 % (or 2 %) of current pollution levels. However, all of the hydrogen pathways would result in very small (either negative or positive) changes in ozone air quality. In some cases they will result in worse ozone air quality (mostly in July, August, and September), and in some cases they will result in better ozone air quality (mostly in October). The truck pathway tends to cause a much wider fluctuation in degradation or improvement of ozone air quality: percentage changes in peak ozone concentrations are approximately − 0. 01 % to 0. 04 % for the assumed 9 % market penetration, and approximately − 0. 03 % to 0. 1 % for the 20 % market penetration. Moreover, the 20 % on-site pathway occasionally results in a decrease of about − 0. 1 % of baseline ozone pollution. Compared to the current ambient pollution level, all three hydrogen pathways are unlikely to cause a serious ozone problem for market penetration levels of HFCVs in the 9 – 20 % range...|$|R
