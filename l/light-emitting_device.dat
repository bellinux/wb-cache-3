5000|$|Polydioctylfluorene is a polymer <b>light-emitting</b> <b>device</b> {{known as}} PLED, which covalently bonds to the carbon {{hydrogen}} chains. PFO is a copolymer of basic polyfluorene, which enables it to release phosphorescent light. This basic fluorene backbone strengthens the molecule {{on account of}} the carbon rings.The cross-linking in polydioctylfluorene structure provides an efficient technique for hole-transport layers to emit light. Also, when a solvent-polymer compound is added the β-phase crystalline structure to be maintained. Efficiency in current can reach a maximum of about 17 cd/A and maximum luminance obtained can be approximately 14,000 cd/m(2). The hole-transport layers (HTLs) improve the polymer’s anode hole injection and greatly increase electron blocking. [...] By having the capability to control the microstructure of phase domains gives an opportunity to optimize the optoelectronic properties of PFO based products. When needs for optoelectronic emittance are reached in polydioctylfluorene, the electroluminescence given off in dependent on the active layer in the conjugate polymer. Another way to affect the optoelectronic properties is by altering how dense the phase chain segments are ordered. Low densities can be achieved from tremendously slow crystallization while on the other hand directional crystalline solution can be achieved by use of thermal gradients.|$|E

In contrast to the simultaneous bipolar carrier injection used in conventional p-n junction light-emitting diodes, this device employs sequential unipolar programming of both electrons and holes across a tunneling barrier from the same semiconductor channel. Light emission is strongly correlated with the injection of second carriers into nanocrystals that have been previously programmed with charges of the opposite sign. The properties of this device are well described by the model of a charge injection through Coulomb field modified tunneling processes.
