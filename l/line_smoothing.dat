40|$|Surface {{capturing}} is {{a technique}} for modelling the water surface in numerical computations of water flow: the computational grid is not deformed, a separate surface model gives {{the location of the}} water surface in the grid. Surface capturing is generally applicable and can handle complicated ship geometries. For steady flow problems, the major disadvantage is that most capturing methods do not allow the use of fast solution methods. This thesis shows that fast solution of a surface capturing model is possible. For this, a flow model is derived that consists of conservation laws only. As these equations allow coupled solution, they can be solved efficiently for steady flows. The flow equations are discretised with a finite-volume method. The convective part is discretised with linearised Riemann fluxes, which guarantee the stability of the discretisation and good performance of the relaxation methods. A RANS turbulence model is added to the system. A multigrid solver is combined with line Gauss-Seidel smoothing. The source term in the turbulence model can make the <b>line</b> <b>smoothing</b> unstable. Therefore, a local adaptive damping is added to the smoother. Also, the mixture surface model and the turbulence model cause large differences in the solutions on fine and coarse grids, so nonlinear multigrid is ineffective. Our multigrid method combines nonlinear smoothing on the finest grid with linear coarse grid corrections. The discretisation is made second-order accurate with a limited scheme. To keep the water surface sharp, a compressive limiter is used for the volume fraction, that indicates the surface. The second-order accurate equations are solved with defect correction. Results are presented for a 2 D channel flow with a bottom bump. The capturing model gives good agreement with experiments and existing numerical models. The multigrid solution is up to 20 times faster than single-grid <b>line</b> <b>smoothing.</b> The thesis also contains two smaller topics: an unstructured grid refinement method for ship flow grids and a study of shock behaviour for a compressible two-fluid flow model.

The lines are modelled by B-spline curves which maintain their smooth feature. Smoothing is performed by reducing the curvature using a snake model.

Parameters are automatically defined so that the method can be applied to large sets without user intervention.

We use the new results to demonstrate that the laser chirping in Compton sources at high laser intensities: (i)  enables the use of higher order harmonics, thereby reducing the required electron beam energies; and (ii)  increases the photon yield in a small frequency band beyond that possible with the fundamental without chirping. This combination of chirping and higher harmonics can lead to substantial savings in the design, construction and operational costs of the new Compton sources. This is of particular importance to the widely popular laser-plasma accelerator based Compton sources, as the improvement in their beam quality enters the regime where chirping is most effective...|$|E

Multicolor Fourier analysis is {{used to analyze the}} behavior of standard multigrid methods for problems in one and two dimensions. Relation between multicolor and standard Fourier analysis is established. Multiple coarse grid methods for solving model problems in 1 and 2 dimensions are considered; at each coarse grid level we use more than one coarse grid to improve convergence. For a given Dirichlet problem, a related extended problem is first constructed; a purification procedure can be used to obtain Moore-Penrose solutions of the singular systems encountered.

A RasterDEM derived from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) AeS- 1 data, operated by AeroSensing Radarsysteme GmbH, serves as input for the software system. Prior to vector processing of the contour lines, DEM smoothing and local peak detection are perfomed on the raster data. Contour lines are organized in point and polygon lists.

40|$|This master thesis was {{executed}} at the Department of Electrical Power Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The thesis was initiated {{to establish and}} evaluate an alternative model representation of the facility at Ormen Lange. Traditionally, a PQ-model {{has been used to}} represent Ormen Lange. This thesis, however, has implemented three two-terminal dc line models (converter models) to represent the facility. The first part of the thesis starts with an overall introduction to the basic principles of configuration, operation and control of HVDC systems. The objective of this part is to provide an overview of the HVDC technology which is treated in detail later in the thesis. The software tool 9 ̆ 3 Power System Simulator for Engineering 9 ̆ 4 (PSS/E) was used for both power flow and dynamic simulations performed in this thesis. The second part of the thesis describes the power flow establishment, and constitutes the basis for both power flow and dynamic simulations. The main focus in this part is the modeling of the two-terminal dc line model which is implemented at Nyhamna. Data for the two-terminal dc line model is presented on three consecutive data records. Since these data enables not only power flow analysis but also establishes the initial steady-state for the dynamic analysis, a detailed description is presented in this section. The latter data is based on technical information provided by ABB and default values in PSS/E. The third part of the thesis presents the power flow simulations. The objective of this part is to gain knowledge about the performance of the two-terminal dc line model implemented at Ormen Lange. This knowledge facilitates the understanding of the following dynamic simulations. Two cases were studied to simulate the action of the converter control system when exposed to a depression in rectifier bus voltage. In the first case the rectifier transformer tap settings were adjustable. In the second case the rectifier tap settings were locked to its initial value. The purpose of locking the tap setting was to represent a transient situation where the tap changer action is too slow and hence not considered. The result showed that with adjustable rectifier tap settings, the depression in rectifier bus voltage is handled by reducing the rectifier transformer tap position and firing delay angle. This increased the voltage on the valve side of the rectifier transformer and enabled the rectifier to maintain dc current control. Consequently, the scheduled dc values were unaffected by the depression in rectifier bus voltage. However, with the rectifier tap setting locked, the transformer did not boost the voltage on the valve side of the rectifier transformer. This caused the control logic to reduce the rectifier firing delay angle to its minimum, and the inverter assumed control of the dc current. With the inverter in control of the current, the scheduled dc current was reduced by a fraction equal to the current margin along with the remainder dc values. Hence, the presence of an adequate rectifier transformer setting is essential for the two-terminal dc line model to maintain scheduled dc values during voltage depression. All simulations showed that a voltage depression at the rectifier bus leads to a reduction in rectifier reactive power consumption. This is due to the action from the control logic which reduced the rectifier firing delay angle to counteract the voltage depression. The greatest reduction in rectifier reactive consumption was experienced when the rectifier firing delay angle was reduced to its minimum value. Hence, in situations with depressed bus voltage, the latter operation of the converter control logic causes the two-terminal dc line model to exhibit less stress to the ac system than the PQ-model. The fourth part of this thesis contains {{a detailed description of the}} dynamic modeling of the two-terminal dc line model (CDC 4 T). Many of the chosen parameters are based on an example in [15], and do not necessary represent realistic values. The final part of this thesis presents the dynamic simulations. The objective of this part is to analyze the control actions of the CDC 4 T model under normal regulation and during temporary overriding the normal regulation. This was performed by introducing ac system faults which depressed the rectifier bus voltage to a varying degree. Further, this part analyzed the consequence of using the dynamic model CDC 4 T to represent Ormen Lange instead of a PQ-model. The purpose was to determine whether the response from the ac system differs when using the CDC 4 T model instead of a PQ-model. It is important to emphasize that this part does not evaluate stability issues associated with the implementation of CDC 4 T. The results from the dynamic simulations showed that CDC 4 T exhibited an instantaneous response to changes in rectifier ac voltage. This is because CDC 4 T is a pseudo steady-state dynamic model which omits the L/R dynamic of the dc system and high frequency firing angle controller dynamics. Further, the results revealed an important characteristic of the CDC 4 T model. After fault clearance, the rectifier bus exhibited small voltage fluctuations. The rectifiers compensated these fluctuations by adjusting their firing delay angles correspondingly. Consequently, the latter resulted in fluctuations in reactive power consumption. This means that the ac system perceives the CDC 4 T model as a varying reactive load following fault clearance. Comparing the ac system response when using the CDC 4 T model and when using the PQ-model, the results showed that the main difference was CDC 4 T 9 ̆ 2 s generation of reactive power fluctuations. These fluctuations were experienced in the transmission line going into Nyhamna and Viklandet, and were substantial compared to the initial loading of the transmission lines. Two arguments were used to substantiate why the response from the CDC 4 T model only differs from the PQ-model in terms of reactive power fluctuations: I. The calculated value of the short circuit ratio at Nyhamna indicated a strong interconnected ac/dc system. II. The dynamic behavior of the pseudo-steady state model, CDC 4 T, is limited. Both the L/R dynamic of the dc <b>line,</b> <b>smoothing</b> reactors and high frequency controller dynamics are omitted. In further studies where converter modeling at Ormen Lange is considered, a more complex dynamic dc model should be utilized to represent the converters. This model should include L/R dynamic of the dc system and high-speed controller dynamics, and will thus influence the ac system to a greater extent than CDC 4 T. Further, the model establishment should focus on achieving a sufficiently realistic load representation of Ormen Lange. In this manner, the converters 9 ̆ 2 influence on system stability can be evaluated...|$|E
