They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, <b>lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1561, King Charles IX of France {{received}} a <b>lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> as a lucky charm.

At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of <b>lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> a symbol of springtime, on May 1. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of <b>lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> or dog rose flowers.|$|E

25|$|From an {{economic}} point of view, the order Asparagales {{is second in}} importance within the monocots to the order Poales (which includes grasses and cereals). Species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla), as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, gladiolus, iris, orchids), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, <b>lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> Agapanthus).|$|E
25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, {{since they do}} not like in general the wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of the}} country. These forests also have English oaks and small-leaved lindens and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, bog bilberries, wild rosemary and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to <b>Lily</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and yellow loosestrife.|$|E
