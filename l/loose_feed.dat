Generational studies conducted by researchers at University of California, Davis have shown some foods that pass AAFCO's feeding trials are still not suitable for long-term use and estimated that of 100 foods that pass the nutritional analysis, 10 to 20 would not pass the feeding trials. Although maximum levels of intake of some nutrients have been established because of concerns with overnutrition, many still lack a maximum allowed level and some contains large disparity between maximum and minimum values. The NRC accepts that despite ongoing research, large gaps still exist in the knowledge of quantitative nutritional information for specific nutrients.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{population}} of adult male sperm whales in Bleik Canyon {{off the coast of}} northern Norway. Previous studies have shown this population to be an open population with a few individuals present for many years and a large group of exchanging males, mainly younger individuals. My study aims to update the current abundance estimate with data from 1987 to 2010, investigate individuals that are long-time present in the area and highlight some of the concern of using both photo-ID and commercial whalesafaris as platforms for scientific studies. The study supports the results from previous studies and confirms the presence of both transient and resident male sperm whales in Bleik Canyon as a <b>loose</b> <b>feeding</b> aggregation. The number of sighted whales fluctuated between years, and no trend was found. The number of sampling trips only explained about half of the varying number of sightings, and presence of killer whales, pilot whales and a variable food distribution was proposed as other influencing factors. The estimated abundance also fluctuated between years without any trend. An open model with multiple seasonal sightings is suggested to be the most realistic model for the abundance estimates. The presence of male sperm whales in Bleik Canyon is not unique for the Norwegian Sea, as several matches have been found between Bleik Canyon and Malangsdjupet. However, it is unique to have such a high abundance of sperm whales so close to land, which is of great importance for the tourism of this area. Further investigations is needed to reveal the whereabouts of these male sperm whales during winter and whether or not the individuals sighted in Bleik Canyon also has been sighted at other important sperm whale locations, such as the mating grounds of the Azores...|$|R

50|$|The {{crescent}} honeyeater is arboreal, foraging mainly {{among the}} foliage and {{flowers in the}} understory and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects. It has been recorded eating the honeydew of psyllids, soft scale and felt scale insects. It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects. While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in <b>loose</b> <b>feeding</b> flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources. A study in forest near Hobart in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, but nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed include moths and flies, and the tree trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) during the breeding season in spring. The flowering of royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters. It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath (Astroloma conostephioides) it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute. Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species, waratah (Telopea), tubular flowered genera including Astroloma, Epacris and Correa, mistletoes of the genus Amyema, and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. In Bondi State Forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung (Persoonia confertiflora), native holly (Lomatia ilicifolia), tall shaggy-pea (Oxylobium arborescens), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa). Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at Adenanthos flowers {{than those in the}} nearby Fleurieu Peninsula, while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall.|$|R

60|$|After riding at {{full speed}} for eight or nine miles, they broke into a walk, {{stopping}} every few minutes to listen. They knew {{that they would be}} able to hear the sound of pursuit at least a mile away, and as their ponies would start fresh again, they were able to take things quietly. So sometimes cantering sometimes walking, they reached the river at about one o'clock in the morning. On the opposite bank stood the little village of Tugela Ferry. Here there was a drift, and there was no occasion to use the ferry-boat except when the river was swollen by rain. It now reached only just up to the ponies' bellies; they therefore crossed without the least difficulty, and after passing through the village, left the road, and struck off across the country to the south- west. When four or five miles away they halted at a donga, and leading the ponies down, turned them <b>loose</b> to <b>feed,</b> ate their supper, and were soon asleep.|$|R

Overall estimated richness for the system ranged from 10. 1 - 13. 5 species. The high degree of parasite faunal overlap between M. rhinoceros and the two Panesthia species is surprising given the disparate ecological niches that they occupy; P. cribrata and P. tryoni tryoni burrow in, and feed upon, moist decaying wood and require a climate that is moist all year round, whereas M. rhinoceros burrows in <b>loose</b> soil, <b>feeds</b> on fallen leaf litter and is tolerant of much drier environments...|$|R
50|$|In India {{the same}} {{situation}} appears in Buddhist scriptures as the Sihacamma Jataka. Here the ass's master puts the lion's skin over his beast and turns it <b>loose</b> to <b>feed</b> in the grain fields during his travels. The village watchman is usually too terrified {{to do anything but}} finally one of them raises the villagers; when they chase the ass, it begins to bray and betrays its true identity. The ass is then beaten to death. A neighbouring tale, the Sihakottukha Jataka, plays on the motif of being given away by one's voice. In this a lion has sired a son on a she-jackal that looks like his father but has a jackal's howl. He is therefore advised to stay silent in future. A common European variant on this sentiment appears in the Sephardic proverb in Ladino, Asno callado, por sabio contado, a silent ass is considered wise. Another English equivalent is 'A fool is not known until he opens his mouth'.|$|R

5000|$|Archosaurs can be {{distinguished}} from other tetrapods {{on the basis of}} several synapomorphies, or shared characteristics, first found in a common ancestor. The simplest and most widely agreed synapomorphies of archosaurs include teeth set in sockets, antorbital and [...] (openings in front of the eyes and in the jaw, respectively), and a fourth trochanter (a prominent ridge on the femur). Being set in sockets, the teeth {{were less likely to be}} torn <b>loose</b> during <b>feeding.</b> This feature is responsible for the name [...] "thecodont" [...] (meaning [...] "socket teeth"), which paleontologists used to apply to many Triassic archosaurs. Some archosaurs, such as birds, are secondarily toothless. Antorbital fenestrae reduced the weight of the skull, which was relatively large in early archosaurs, rather like that of modern crocodilians. Mandibular fenestrae may also have reduced the weight of the jaw in some forms. The fourth trochanter provides a large site for the attachment of muscles on the femur. Stronger muscles allowed for erect gaits in early archosaurs, and may also be connected with the ability of the archosaurs or their immediate ancestors to survive the catastrophic Permian-Triassic extinction event.|$|R

6000|$|Fortunately, after I {{left the}} town, a west wind {{continued}} blowing all day, bringing with it many light, flying clouds {{to mitigate the}} sun, so that I was able to cover {{a good number of}} leagues before the evening.

When I rode up to the house, several huge dogs rushed out to attack me: one seized my horse by the tail, dragging the poor beast about this way and that, so that he staggered and could scarcely keep his legs; another caught the bridle-reins in his mouth; while a third fixed his fangs in the heel of my boot. After eyeing me for some moments, the grizzled old herdsman, who wore a knife a yard long at his waist, advanced to the rescue. He shouted at the dogs, and finding that they would not obey, sprang forward and with a few dexterous blows, dealt with his heavy whip-handle, sent them away howling with rage and pain.

And here a fresh trouble awaited us, for when at last with infinite difficulty we had disentangled the great helpless brutes, it was only to find that one of the best of them was very sick. There was no mistake about the way he stood with his legs slightly apart and his head hanging down. He had got the redwater, I was sure of it. Of all the difficulties connected with life and travelling in South Africa those connected with oxen are perhaps the worst. The ox is the most exasperating animal in the world, a negro excepted. He has absolutely no constitution, and never neglects an opportunity of falling sick of some mysterious disease. He will get thin upon the slightest provocation, and from mere maliciousness die of 'poverty'; whereas it is his chief delight to turn round and refuse to pull whenever he finds himself well in the centre of a river, or the waggon-wheel nicely fast in a mud hole. Drive him a few miles over rough roads and you will find that he is footsore; turn him <b>loose</b> to <b>feed</b> and you will discover that he has run away, or if he has not run away he has of malice aforethought eaten 'tulip' and poisoned himself. There is always something with him. The ox is a brute. It was of a piece with his accustomed behaviour for the one in question to break out--on purpose probably--with redwater just when a lion had walked off with his herd. It was exactly what I should have expected, and I was therefore neither disappointed nor surprised.|$|R

Many a man can travel to the very bourne of Heaven, and yet want confidence to put down his half-seeing. Sancho will invent a Journey heavenward as well as anybody. We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us, and, if we do not agree, seems to put its hand into its breeches pocket.

[...] Modern poets differ from the Elizabethans in this: each of the moderns like an Elector of Hanover governs his petty state and knows how many straws are swept daily from the Causeways in all his dominions, and has a continual itching that all the Housewives should have their coppers well scoured: The ancients were Emperors of vast Provinces, they had only heard of the remote ones and scarcely cared to visit them. I will cut all this--I will have no more of Wordsworth or Hunt in particular--Why should we be of the tribe of Manasseh, when we can wander with Esau? Why should we kick against the Pricks, when we can walk on Roses? Why should we be owls, when we can be eagles? Why be teased with [...] "nice-eyed wagtails," [...] when we have in sight [...] "the Cherub Contemplation"? Why with Wordsworth's [...] "Matthew with a bough of wilding in his hand," [...] when we can have Jacques [...] "under an oak," [...] etc.? The secret of the Bough of Wilding will run through your head faster than I can write it. Old Matthew spoke to him some years ago on some nothing, and because he happens in an Evening Walk to imagine the figure of the old Man, he must stamp it down in black and white, and it is henceforth sacred. I don't mean to deny Wordsworth's grandeur and Hunt's merit, but I mean to say we need not be teased with grandeur and merit when we can have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive. Let us have the old Poets and Robin Hood. Your letter and its sonnets gave me more pleasure than will the Fourth Book of Childe Harold and the whole of anybody's life and opinions. In return for your Dish of Filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope they'll look pretty.|$|R
50|$|Both sides {{started the}} second {{have in a}} rather pensive mood before NSW seemed to gain the {{ascendancy}} in field position and general flow of the match. That changed at the 60 minute mark after repeated errors by the Blues lead to QLD receiving their first penalty in over 40 minutes. The Maroons capitalised on this opportunity with Justin Hodges scoring off a deft short ball from Cooper Cronk. Johnathan Thurston missed the sideline conversion keeping the scores at 12-4. With just over 10 minutes to go Trent Merrin steadied some disorganised play by straightening and barging through a terrible attempted tackle by Corey Parker, to score right under the sticks. James Maloney made no mistake with the conversion taking the score to 12-10. The Blues looked {{to go on the}} attack from the ensuing restart, gaining 60m in 4 plays before a badly misdirected pass from Mitchell Pearce ricocheted off Josh Dugan's shoulder and cost the Blues 15m. James Maloney ended up hoisting the ball into the heavens which Billy Slater climbed high to mark with Ryan Hoffman and Andrew Fifita giving away a penalty for tackling him in the air. The Maroons proceeded cautiously with only 5 minutes left on the clock. Realising the shortage of time, Robbie Farah attempted to kick for a 40/20 to give the Blues one last crack at QLD's line but came up short. Darius Boyd returned the kick in fantastic fashion making a 40m run leaving several NSW chasers in his wake. Cameron Smith then ducked down a short side making a break before passing to Corey Parker who in-turn offloaded the ball back to his captain who made a determined charge for the NSW line only to be brought down inches short. With the Blues shot defensively, QLD looked to shift the ball before a streaker who by then had run 80m {{to get in the way}} of play tripped over and fell right amongst the players. QLD ended up getting across the line through Matt Scott but was disallowed the try because of the interference to play. The resulting decision, a neutral infringement, afforded QLD a scrum with the <b>loose</b> head and <b>feed</b> given their superior field position. It ended with James Maloney taking a superb reflex catch of a Johnathan Thurston kick. The ball came out to the Blues captain Farah who then went for the all or nothing kick across field which James McManus was unable to take, knocking the ball into touch. QLD retained their shield and extended their dynasty to 8 straight Origin series victories. Cameron Smith was awarded the Wally Lewis medal for player of the series.|$|R
