40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{requires}} European Member States {{to assess}} the "ecological status" of surface waters. As part of this, many European countries have developed an ecological quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations {{as a measure of}} phytoplankton abundance. The assessment of ecological quality must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or 'reference condition'. It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all European lake types. This involves examining how chlorophyll concentrations vary by lake type, {{in the absence of any}} nutrient pressures from agriculture or wastewater. For this purpose, a dataset of 540 European lakes considered to be in a relatively undisturbed reference condition has been assembled, including data on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic content, surface area and geographical region. Chlorophyll was found to vary with lake type and geographical region, and to be naturally highest in low-altitude, very shallow, high alkalinity and humic lake types and naturally lowest in clear, deep, <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes.</b> The results suggest that light and mineral availability are important drivers of chlorophyll concentrations in undisturbed lakes. Descriptive statistics (median and percentiles) of chlorophyll concentrations were calculated from populations of lakes in this reference lake dataset and used to derive lake-type specific reference chlorophyll concentrations. These reference conditions can be applied, through a comparison with observed chlorophyll concentrations at a site, in the assessments of ecological status and provide a consistent baseline to adopt for European countries...|$|E

The dose yielded 0. 6 g aluminium m– 3 in the epilimnion. Before dosing, pH exceeded 8 in epilimnetic waters but was optimal for flocculation (6 – 8) below 4 m depth. After dosing, {{there was no significant}} change in water clarity, hypolimnetic pH decreased to 5. 5, and soluble aluminium exceeded recommended guidelines for protection of freshwater organisms.

The dominant phytoplankton species changed from Anabaena spp. before dosing, to Ceratium hirudinella, then Staurastrum sp. after dosing. Detection of effectiveness of dosing may have been limited by sampling duration and design, as well as the low alum dose.

40|$|AbstractThousands of Swedish acidified {{lakes and}} streams have been {{regularly}} limed for about 30 years. Standard sampling of fish assemblages in lakes and streams {{was an important}} part of monitoring the trends after liming, i. e. sampling with multi-mesh gillnets in lakes (EN 14757) and electrofishing in streams (EN 14011). Monitoring data are nationally managed, in the National Register of Survey test-fishing and the Swedish Electrofishing Register. We evaluated long-term data from 1029 electrofishing sites in limed streams and gillnet sampling in 750 limed lakes, along with reference data from 195 stream sites and 101 lakes with no upstream liming in their catchments. The median year of first liming was 1986 for both streams and lakes. The proportion of limed stream sites with no fish clearly decreased with time, mean species richness and proportion of sites with brown trout (Salmo trutta) recruits increased. There were no consistent trends in fish occurrence or species richness at non-limed sites, but occurrence of brown trout recruits also increased in acid as well as neutral reference streams. Abundance of brown trout, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) increased significantly more at limed sites than at non-limed reference sites sampled before and after 1986. The mean species richness did not change consistently in limed lakes, but decreased in <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> reference <b>lakes,</b> and fish abundance decreased significantly in limed as well as in non-limed lakes...|$|R

Intercalibration followed standard procedures developed for the European Commission which ensures that outcomes of this exercise are compatible with those for other types of biota in both freshwater and marine water bodies throughout Europe. Lakes were divided into low, medium and high alkalinity types for this exercise. However, {{it was not possible to}} perform a full intercalibration on the <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> due to the short gradient length and confounding influences of pH and humic substances. Values of the Trophie Index of Rott et al. (1999) were computed for all samples in order that national datasets could all be expressed on a common scale.

40|$|A large {{data base}} was {{assembled}} from surveys conducted by several {{federal and state}} agencies on approximately 1500 inland lakes in the Upper Great Lakes Region (UGLR) [...] northern Minnesota and Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. Data were scrutinized carefully {{by a variety of}} quality control procedures, and outliers were eliminated. The quality-assured data base was used to characterize lakes in the three state region according to parameters related to the potential sensitivity of lakes to acidification (e. g alkalinity, pH, conductivity, hydrologic type). A trend of increasing numbers of acidic and very <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> across the region (from west to east) correlates with a similar trend in increasing acidity of precipitation. Drainage lakes are the dominant hydrologic lake type in northern Minnesota, but seepage lakes are most common in northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. Most of the lakes in the data base (78 %) have organic color levels below 50 chloroplatinate units and are classified as "clearwater" systems. Correction of ion balances for contributions of organic anions was unnecessary for these lakes but was useful in improving ion balances of more highly colored lakes. A factor, CF, defined as the ratio of the average chloride concentration in a lake to the average chloride concentration in precipitation, was used as a surrogate measure for hydrologic data on evaporative concentration. Half the lakes had CF values between 2. 3 and 4. 4 (mean: 3. 8). A sulfate enrichment factor (SEF, defined as the sulfate/chloride ratio in a lake divided by the analogous ratio in precipitation) was used {{to determine whether or not}} sulfate behaves conservatively in lakes. SEF > 1 indicates the occurrence of terrestrial sources of sulfate in a lake's watershed; SEF < I indicates net loss of sulfate in a watershed or lake (presumably by sulfate reduction), if chloride is assumed to behave conservatively. Only 43 t of the lakes exhibited nearly conservative behavior (0. 75 < SEF < 1. 25), and 40 % of the lakes showed evidence of significant sulfate sinks. Two measures of acidification were defined for each lake: change in sulfate (ASO 4) and change in alkalinity (AAlk), both parameters being the difference between measured (present) lake values and background (pristine levels), which were estimated for each lake by a variety of methods. Several lines of evidence suggest that background sulfate levels in regional precipitation (bSO 4 p) were between 10 and 20 u. eq/L; multiplying these values times CF for a lake gives the lake's bSO 4. Good correlations were found between the two measures of lake acidification (ASO. and AAlk) among the UGLR lakes and especially among precipitation-dominated seepage lakes. A separate data base on chemical quality of atmospheric precipitation across the region was obtained from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and used with subsets of the lake data base to explore acid-loading lake response relationships. Significant relationships were found between ASO 4. and precipitation acidity (H+p) but not between AAlk and H+n for all lakes in the region. A weighted regression procedure showed that- H+p had significant relationships with boch ASO 4 and AAlk for seepage lakes,however, and these relationships were used to develop estimates of acid loading criteria designed to prevent the acidificacion of the most acid-sensitive lakes in each state. The critical H+p loading value estimated this way for Minnesota lakes is about 11 kg/ha-yr. A model to predict in-lake alkalinity generation (IAG) was developed based on CSTR (continuous-flow stirred reactor) kinetics. The model describes budgets for each ion involved in alkalinity regulation by a differential equation that includes terms for inputs and outputs and a first-order source/sink term. The equations are linked to an alkalinity balance equation that includes inputs, outputs, IAG by sulfate and nitrate reduction, and internal alkalinity consumption by ammonium assimilation. Calibration of the model was accomplished using ion budget data obtained from studies on 14 softwater lakes in diverse geographic areas. Rate coefficients generally are similar among softwater lakes: kSO 4,, = 0. 5 m/yr; kNO 3. = 1. 3 yr- 1; kNH 4 + = 1. 5 yr. -t. Sensitivity analysis showed that predicted alkalinity is sensitive to water residence times but not very sensitive to moderate changes in rate coefficient values. According to the model, IAG is important in regulating the alkalinity of lakes with water residence times greater than about 2 years. The model reflects the homeostatic nature of IAG: the process increases with increasing inputs of HNO 3. or H 2 SO 4 and decreases as loadings of these acids decrease.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if aquatic insect production was significantly different between high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> mountain streams and if any differences were associated with food availability factors. The major objectives included determining: (1) if annual production differences occur between high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (2) if processing rates of terrestrial detritus differs between high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (3) if detrital processing rates are related to stream insect productivities; (4) if primary productivity varies between high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (5) if toxic effects or micronutrient limitations exist in high or <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams that could limit insect survivals. A high alkalinity stream was defined as one having over 150 milligrams per liter average total alkalinity. Six study sites on four high alkalinity streams were located in the Wasatch National Forest near Logan in northern Utah. Six study sites on four <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams were located in the Shoshone National Forest near Yellowstone National Park in northern Wyoming. Sites from each region were shown to not differ significantly for all physical parameters tested. The mean annual production of 22 of the 29 invertebrate taxa analyzed were significantly higher in the high alkalinity streams, while 2 taxa were significantly more productive in the <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams. The mean annual production of all taxa summed was significantly higher in the high alkalinity streams. All high alkalinity sites had significantly higher production than any <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> site. Alder leaf packs left open to allow invertebrate activity had a significantly higher rate of weight loss in the high alkalinity stream. Alder leaf packs placed inside fine mesh bags to exclude invertebrate activity showed no significant differences in weight loss when the experiments were terminated. The patterns of weight loss for these mesh packs did differ between the two stream types. In the high alkalinity stream, the leaves had a early rapid weight loss phase followed by a period of reduced weight loss. In the <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> stream, the leaves experienced little weight loss during the early phase of the study but lost weight rapidly during the latter phase. The survivorships of all taxa tested did not differ significantly between high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> water. Estimates of detrital inputs based on drift measurements and standing crops of detritus collected with invertebrate samples showed no significant differences between regions. The following conclusions resulted from the study. The high alkalinity streams had a significantly much higher production of aquatic invertebrates than did the <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams. The high alkalinity streams also had significantly higher standing crops of attached algae and faster processing of alder leaves. Algae and processed allochthonous detritus are two major food sources for many aquatic invertebrates. It is concluded that a major reason for the great difference in invertebrate production between the physically similar high and <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams in this study was the availability difference of these two food sources.

The final optimum pH for efficient P removal was found to be within the range of 5. 7 - 5. 9.

In this paper we use regression analysis to examine the relationship of growing season mean chlorophyll a concentration with total phosphorus and total nitrogen using summary data from over 1, 000 European lakes. For analysis, lakes were grouped into types with three categories of mean depth, alkalinity and humic content. The lakes were also divided into broad geographic regions covering Atlantic, Northern, Central/Baltic and for some types the Mediterranean areas of Europe. Chlorophyll a was found to be significantly related to both total phosphorus and total nitrogen, although total phosphorus was almost always found to be the best predictor of chlorophyll. Different nutrient chlorophyll relationships were found for lakes according to mean depth and alkalinity, although no significant effect of geographic region or humic content was found for the majority of lake types.

40|$|Recent European water legislation, the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{requires}} European Member States {{to assess}} the ¿ecological status¿ of surface waters. As part of this, many European countries are choosing to develop a quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations {{as a measure of}} phytoplankton abundance. The assessment of ecological quality and its component parts, such as chlorophyll, must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or ¿reference condition¿. It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all European lake types, or alternatively, models for predicting reference chlorophyll concentrations on a site-specific basis. For this purpose, a large dataset of European lakes considered to be in reference condition has been assembled; 466 lakes in total. Data were included from 12 European countries, but lakes from Norway and Finland dominated and made up 82 % of all reference lakes. Data have been collated on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic type, surface area, and geographical region. Regression models were developed for estimating site-specific reference chlorophyll concentrations from significant predictor ¿typology¿ variables. Reference chlorophyll concentrations were found to vary along a number of environmental gradients. Concentrations increased with colour and alkalinity, and decreased with lake depth and altitude. Forward selection was used to identify independent explanatory variables in regression models for predicting site-specific reference chlorophyll concentrations. Due to data limitations, colour was only included in the model for very humic lakes. Depth was selected as an explanatory variable in all models. Alkalinity was included in models for low colour and humic lakes and altitude was included in models for low colour and very humic lakes. Uncertainty in the models was quite high and arises from errors in the data used to develop the models (including natural temporal and spatial variability in data) and also from additional explanatory variables not considered in the models, particularly nutrient concentrations, flushing rate and grazing. Despite these uncertainties, site-specific reference conditions are still recommended in preference to type-specific reference conditions, as they should result in reduced error in ecological status classifications, particularly for lakes close to typology boundaries. Because of the bias in the dataset towards Northern European <b>low</b> and medium <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes,</b> the models are not currently recommended for application to lakes in Central and Mediterranean regions of Europe where drivers of background productivity could be different.

Immediately after moulting, animals lost 45 % of the total body calcium via the shed exoskeleton (exuvia), and only 11 % was retained in the uncalcified body. At 24 h postmoult, exoskeleton calcium increased to ~ 46 % of the intermoult stage. Ammonia excretion was not affected by seawater alkalinity. After moulting, bicarbonate excretion was immediately reversed from excretion to uptake (~ 4 - 6 fold higher rates than intermoult) over the whole 24 h postmoult period, peaking at 3 - 6 h. These data suggest that exoskeleton calcification is not completed by 24 h postmoult. <b>Low</b> seawater <b>alkalinity</b> reduced postmoult bicarbonate uptake by 29 % on average.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{operating}} water recirculating systems (RAS) {{with high}} make-up water flushing rates in locations that have <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> {{in the raw}} water, such as Norway, knowledge about the required RAS alkalinity concentration is important. Flushing RAS with make-up water containing <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> washes out valuable base added to the RAS (as bicarbonate, hydroxide, or carbonate), which increases farm operating costs when high alkalinity concentrations are maintained; however, alkalinity must not be so low that it interferes with nitrification or pH stability. For these reasons, a {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effects of alkalinity on biofilter performance, and CO 2 stripping during cascade aeration, within two replicate semi-commercial scale Atlantic salmon smolt RAS operated with moving bed biological filters. Alkalinity treatments of nominal 10, 70, and 200 mg/L as CaCO 3 were maintained using a pH controller and chemical dosing pumps supplying sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3). Each of the three treatments was replicated three times in each RAS. Both RAS were operated at each treatment level for 2 weeks; water quality sampling was conducted {{at the end of the}} second week. A constant feeding of 23 kg/day/RAS was provided every 1 – 2 h, and continuous lighting, which minimized diurnal fluctuations in water quality. RAS hydraulic retention time and water temperature were 4. 3 days and 12. 5 ± 0. 5 °C, respectively, typical of smolt production RAS in Norway. It was found that a <b>low</b> nominal <b>alkalinity</b> (10 mg/L as CaCO 3) led to a significantly higher steady-state TAN concentration, compared to when 70 or 200 mg/L alkalinity was used. The mean areal nitrification rate was higher at the lowest alkalinity; however, the mean TAN removal efficiency across the MBBR was not significantly affected by alkalinity treatment. The CO 2 stripping efficiency showed only a tendency towards higher efficiency at the <b>lowest</b> <b>alkalinity.</b> In contrast, the relative fraction of total inorganic carbon that was removed from the RAS during CO 2 stripping was much higher at a <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> (10 mg/L) compared to the higher alkalinities (70 and 200 mg/L as CaCO 3). Despite this, when calculating the total loss of inorganic carbon from RAS, it was found that the daily loss was about equal at 10, and 70 mg/L, whereas it was highest at 200 mg/L alkalinity. pH recordings demonstrated that the 10 mg/L alkalinity treatment resulted in the lowest system pH, the largest increase in [H+] across the fish culture tanks, as well as giving little response time in case of alkalinity dosing malfunction. Rapid pH changes under the relatively acidic conditions at 10 mg/L alkalinity may ultimately create fish health issues due to e. g. CO 2 or if aluminium or other metals are present. In conclusion, Atlantic salmon smolt producers using soft water make-up sources should aim for 70 mg/L alkalinity considering the relatively low loss of inorganic carbon compared to 200 mg/L alkalinity, and the increased pH stability as well as reduced TAN concentration, compared to lower alkalinity concentrations...|$|R

The <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> high mountain <b>Lake</b> Nero di Cornisello (2233 m a. s. l., Adamello-Brenta Natural Park, Trentino, NE Italy) has been selected as case-study, in the frame of this Ph. D. thesis, to evaluate the potential of dinoflagellates in paleolimnology as biological proxies. Studies on the taxonomy, eco-physiology of living dinoflagellates and quali-quantitative analyses of their organic-walled cysts in sediments were performed. A multidisciplinary approach has been applied, with seasonal monitoring of the physical-chemical characteristics of the lake, in situ study of the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton, in vitro study of the eco-physiology, morphology and taxonomy of the dominant dinoflagellate species and a quali-quantitative sediment core study of the preserved organic-walled dinocysts. Two dinoflagellate species, Peridinium umbonatum var. umbonatum (P. u.) and Peridinium cinctum (P. c.) are the main primary producers of Lake Nero di Cornisello during spring and summer. The dominance of P. u. over P. c. during the period of proliferation could be caused by the precocity in encystment and excystment. The cyst of P. u. in possession of an original hypocystal archeopyle. P. u. has maximum germination percentage at pH 6 and at 4 °C, but it also excysts at pH from 4 to around 9. This species doesn’t need prolonged exposure to light to germinate and grow. P. u. is a species obligated to oligotrophic conditions needing low amounts of nutrients for germination and growth. Three peridinioid organic-walled cyst morphotypes have been found in Holocene sediments of Lake Nero di Cornisello. A detailed observation of the dinocysts and comparison with P. u. cysts suggests that the peridinioid dinocyst morphotype 1 {{belongs to the}} dominant species living at present in the lake. Detailed observations on morphotype 2 show that also this dinocyst belongs to the species P. umbonatum, but it differs from morphotype 1 in size and general morphology. Morphotype 2 is usually bigger. The third morphotype, more rounded, probably belongs to the genus Peridinium as well. The analyses of the trends of the three dinocyst morphotypes in the sediment core and their comparison with other proxies permitt to postulate an historical description of environmental and climate changes occurred in Lake Nero di Cornisello. On the basis of my experience it is possible to postulate that the study and use of dinoflatellates as biological proxies in paleolimnology is possible, potentially providing important information on climate and environmental changes...|$|R

40|$|Eutrophication is {{the most}} {{widespread}} pressure impacting on lakes worldwide and, in general, its control is underpinned by the premise that algal biomass is regulated by phosphorus availability. This paper aims to demonstrate that not all lakes will conform to the underlying principle of the Chl:TP relationships using variables collected widely in lake monitoring programmes across the world (i. e. total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl) concentrations). The ratio of annual mean Chl and TP concentrations in 94 lakes (2007 and 2008) {{was used as a}} measure of the efficiency with which TP is transferred into algal biomass (i. e. as an indicator of P limitation) to investigate the validity of the phosphorus reduction approach. Chl:TP ratios ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 84 in 2007 and from 0. 03 to 0. 96 in 2008. Chl and TP values were positively correlated (p < 0. 05) with alkalinity, and negatively correlated with depth and surface area, in both years. In general, mean annual Chl and TP concentrations increased as alkalinity increased and depth decreased. However, Chl:TP ratio was highest in high <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> in 2007, and moderate <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> in 2008. Our results indicate that the use of TP water quality targets alone is insufficient to accurately manage eutrophication pressures at the lake specific scale, and that a wider range of ecological and ecosystem service evaluation targets would provide a more comprehensive assessment of management needs. The wide range of Chl:TP ratio values reported in this study suggests that, although reducing TP concentrations in lakes is undoubtedly a sensible approach to eutrophication management in many cases, TP reductions alone may not result in the expected reductions in phytoplankton biomass in all lakes...|$|R

40|$|The river Bivaröd {{is one of}} {{the river}} Helgeån tributaries which has the highest and the fastest {{increase}} in water colour. The reason behind this increase is unclear but several factors have been suggested to affect this pattern. In this work, I studied the role of land use, iron and precipitation for water colour increase in river Bivaröd for the period 1976 - 2011. Data from a field study along with data from SRK for river Helgeån were used for the analyses. The results showed that both water colour and iron concentration increase {{and that there is a}} strong correlation between these two variables. Land use and especially intensive forestry and short distances of the water flow are suggested as possible factors that may affect the water colour. Approximately 68 % of the river Bivarödån basin is covered by forest. Forests are a major source of humic matter production that gives the water its brown colour. The increase in iron concentration may be alarming considering that river Bivarödån has <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity.</b> Iron in conjunction with <b>low</b> <b>alkalinity</b> may affect the water ecosystem negatively. The climate seems to play an important role in the dynamics of humic substances in river Bivaröd. Water colour was significantly lower in January than in July. Ground frost which forms in January because of the low temperatures  is suggested as a major reason why humic substances leaching is inhibited at this time of year. Extended periods without frost in the ground because of warmer climate can contribute to watercolor increase...|$|R
