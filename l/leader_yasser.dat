5|$|Bush {{emphasized}} {{a careful}} {{approach to the}} conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
25|$|Habash was {{a leading}} member of the Palestine Liberation Organization until 1967 when he was sidelined by Fatah <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. In response, Habash founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.|$|E
5000|$|Yusef Urabi (also spelled Yusuf Orabi) was a Palestinian {{officer in}} the Syrian Army {{as well as an}} early member of Fatah's armed wing, al-Assifa. In 1966 he was killed in the Yarmouk Camp in Damascus during an attempt to ease {{tensions}} between Palestinian <b>leaders</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and Ahmed Jibril.|$|R
50|$|The PDFLP soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as the most intellectual of the Palestinian fedayeen groups, and drew heavily on Marxist-Leninist theory to explain {{the situation in the}} Middle East. Its other <b>leaders</b> included <b>Yasser</b> Abed Rabbo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{installation}} [...] "Old People's Home," [...] (2008) comprised 13 hyperrealist {{sculptures of}} elderly world <b>leaders,</b> including <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and Leonid Brezhnev, in electric wheelchairs set to automatically {{wander through the}} room and bump into one another.|$|R
25|$|Palestinians {{view the}} Second Intifada {{as part of}} their ongoing {{struggle}} for national liberation and an end to Israeli occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a wave of Palestinian terrorism instigated and pre-planned by then Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Day {{provoked}} controversy by not offering {{condolences to}} Palestinians {{after the death}} of PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. The controversy was heightened when it was leaked to the media that Day had attempted to justify his actions to his party colleagues by circulating an article by David Frum which suggested that Arafat had died of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|After {{the suicide}} bombing, Palestinian {{university}} {{students at the}} An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus created an exhibition celebrating {{the first anniversary of}} the Second Intifada. The exhibit’s main attraction was a room-sized re-enactment of the bombing at Sbarro. The installation featured broken furniture splattered with fake blood and human body parts. The entrance to the exhibition was illustrated with a mural depicting the bombing. The exhibit was later shut down by Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat.|$|E

50|$|This party's main idols are Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Doğan Avcıoğlu and Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev. Unlike other socialist {{parties in}} Turkey, they often criticise Marxism for being Eurocentrist. They {{describe}} Kemalism as socialism with Turkish characteristics. They also idolize socialist, third worldist and left-wing nationalist <b>leaders</b> like <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Hugo Chávez, Josip Broz Tito and Patrice Lumumba.|$|R
50|$|The book {{is based}} on {{interviews}} with purported terrorists. Topics include Klein's meetings with a recruited Palestinian suicide bomber; interviews with Muhammed Abdel-El, the head of a Popular Resistance Committee, and Hamas <b>leader</b> Sheikh <b>Yasser</b> Hamad, and confrontations with the Muslim desecrators of Jewish and Christian holy sites. There is also a section in which jihadist leaders are petitioned to describe what life in the U.S. would be like under the rule of Islam, a chapter on Christian persecution in the Middle East, and a chapter claiming the U.S. funds terrorism.|$|R
25|$|By late 1972, {{the first}} batch of Montoneros started {{receiving}} terrorist training in Lebanon. Upon completion of training, they served as political contacts in Europe before setting up administrative headquarters to handle logistics, falsify documents, and traffic arms. The PLO-Montoneros alliance was made public in 1977 when Montoneros commanders Mario Firmenich and Fernando Vaca Narvaja flew to Beirut to meet and be photographed with PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. At that time, Arafat and the PLO were receiving much financial and political support from left-wing governments and political parties worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, he met Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, {{and asked}} him to inform other Communist leaders, as well as Arab leaders about his ideas for a {{peaceful}} settlement. In early 1970, he was invited to talks by Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser, but was stopped by the Israeli government. Attempts to contact the Palestine Liberation Organization <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, in 1974, were even seen as high treason. Goldmann thought this behavior to be foolish. In 1982, he called on the Israeli Prime Minister to not reanimate anti-Zionism and antisemitism with the campaign in the Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwait {{conducted}} {{a campaign of}} expulsion against the Palestinians living in the country, who before the war had numbered 400,000. Some 200,000 who had fled during the Iraqi occupation were banned from returning, while the remaining 200,000 were pressured into leaving by the authorities, who {{conducted a}} campaign of terror, violence, and economic pressure {{to get them to}} leave. The Palestinians expelled from Kuwait moved to Jordan, where they had citizenship. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat with Saddam Hussein.|$|E
50|$|Petros {{assumed the}} title of Patriarchate of Alexandria on March 9, 1997, {{following}} his election by the Holy Synod in February 1997. He had a close rapport with his predecessor, Patriarch Parthenius III of Alexandria and assumed the latter's post {{after his death in}} 1996. Throughout his reign, Petros built relationships with other church organizations and engaged with religious churches outside the Greek Orthodox community. Petros also initiated peaceful relationships between the Muslim and Christian people in the Middle East and interacted with Arab <b>leaders,</b> including <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. Petros reigned as Patriarch of Alexandria for seven years until his death.|$|R
50|$|On the surface, Khatib's {{rebellion}} {{seemed a}} spontaneous act that reflected Muslim discontent within the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) against their predominantly Christian leadership. The reality, however, was more complex. In fact, the mutiny had been secretly orchestrated by Fatah, the main Palestinian faction and had well-defined objectives. Fatah <b>leaders</b> - notably <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, Abu Iyad, Abu Jihad and Ali Hassan Salameh - had always regarded the Lebanese Army {{as a potential}} military threat to the PLO, a threat neutralized by {{the formation of the}} LAA.|$|R
50|$|While {{the first}} wave of assassinations from October 1972 to early 1973 caused greater consternation among Palestinian officials, it was the raid on Lebanon - Operation Spring of Youth in April 1973 - that truly shocked the Arab world. The audacity of the mission, plus the fact that senior <b>leaders</b> such as <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, Abu Iyad and Ali Hassan Salameh were only yards away from the fighting, contributed to the {{creation}} of the belief that Israel was capable of striking anywhere, anytime. It also brought about popular mourning. At the funerals for the victims of the raid, half a million people came into the streets of Beirut. Nearly six years later, 100,000 people, including Arafat, turned out in the same city to bury Salameh.|$|R
25|$|During to the Gulf War in 1990–91, Arafat {{supported}} Saddam Hussein's {{invasion of}} Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly {{led to this}} exodus {{was a response to}} the alignment of PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat with Saddam Hussein. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO which brought the PLO to the brink of crisis.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 Lebanon {{war began}} on 6 June 1982, when Israel invaded {{again for the}} purpose of attacking the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Israeli army laid siege to Beirut. During the conflict, {{according}} to Lebanese sources, between 15,000–20,000 people were killed, mostly civilians. According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, between 5,000–8,000 civilians were killed. Fighting also occurred between Israel and Syria. The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, got all sides to agree to a cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The Multinational Force in Lebanon arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. The PLO leadership retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and moved to Tunisia.|$|E
500|$|In February, King Hussein sent twenty carloads {{of troops}} and {{police to order}} a Fatah unit to leave the town of Karameh. When it arrived, the column found itself {{surrounded}} by men wielding machine guns; their commander said [...] "You have three minutes to decide whether you leave or die". They withdrew. By March, several hundred civilians lived in the camp, along with about 900 guerrillas, mostly from Fatah, and PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, who had his headquarters there.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Taqi Abedi, the Toronto based scholar, {{produced}} a critical appraisal {{for a more}} holistic view of the life, thought, and work of Faiz Ahmed Faiz in [...] "Faiz Fahmi", This book [...] comprising 162 articles on various aspects of Faiz by both Dr. Taqi Abedi and other scholars including Gopi Chand Narang, Shams ur Rahman Faruqi, Shan-ul-Haq Haqqee, Shamim Hanafi, Sajjad Zaheer, etc.. The anthology includes articles of stalwarts of Urdu literature from across the world including India, Pakistan, Russia, England, Canada, the United States and other countries. Articles of several English and Russian writers such as George Fisher, Alexander Surikov, Lyudmala Vasilyeva and of world <b>leaders</b> like <b>Yasser</b> Arafat also embellish the book. On the sensitive issue of Faiz's religion, Abedi shows that despite his Marxist inclinations he remained a Muslim and often drew on Islamic themes in his poetry, all his life events, including his marriage to (Alys Faiz), were conducted according to Islamic rites [...] He has also {{compiled a list of}} all the books that Faiz had read in his later years. In his comparison of Faiz and Josh Malihabadi he lists their strengths and weaknesses without falling in the groupist trap of [...] "Faiz Bada Ya Josh Bada" [...] (Is Faiz bigger or Josh ?).|$|R
500|$|Abnormally high {{concentrations}} of 210Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, a heavy smoker, who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes. The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the [...] "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn {{as to whether the}} Palestinian leader was poisoned or not", and that [...] "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210." [...] On 27 November 2012 Arafat's body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia. On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the group's finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafat's blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush. The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from [...] "natural environmental origin". Following later Russian tests, Vladimir Uiba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated in December 2013 that Arafat died of natural causes, and they had no plans to conduct further tests.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a [...] "20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests" [...] brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Waldorf was on red alert, and German Shepherd sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. 15 suites of the hotel were reserved for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Arab delegation. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted Vice President, and a 90-minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria, and in 1985, the NBA held its first-ever draft lottery between non-playoff teams at the Starlight Room. The lottery was for the 1985 NBA Draft in which Patrick Ewing was the consensus number one pick.|$|E
2500|$|Prime {{minister}} Ariel Sharon {{stated that}} after Ze'evi's assassination [...] "everything had changed", {{and he held}} the Palestinian <b>leader,</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, personally responsible for the assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Fischer {{has been}} criticized for {{attending}} a 1969 conference of the Palestine Liberation Organization, where Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat called for an all-out war on Israel [...] "until the end".|$|E
2500|$|Specter also {{questioned}} her about a 2003 letter that {{she wrote to}} Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat to protest {{the use of a}} donkey as a suicide bomber.

2500|$|Avnery, Peled's partner, {{arrived in}} Beirut in quite {{different}} circumstances—crossing the lines {{to conduct a}} first-ever meeting with PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, at his besieged and bombarded headquarters. Cohen strongly condemned the meeting, which he characterised as [...] "fawning". Thereupon Peled, always known as a forthright speaker, accused Cohen of being [...] "a war criminal who bombards a civilian population".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, while {{speaking}} at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), he criticized Arab culture, {{saying it was}} rife with antisemitism. He referred to the Palestinian keffiyeh, a traditional Arab head covering that became associated with PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, {{as a symbol of}} terrorism. In response, UCSB professor Walid Afifi said that Horowitz was [...] "preaching hate" [...] and smearing Arab culture.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{fighting}} several incidents of looting took place: a crowd took furniture, wall tiles and personal belongings from the villa of the by now deceased Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat; {{the home of}} former Fatah commander Mohammed Dahlan was also looted: [...] "An AFP correspondent witnessed dozens of Palestinians taking everything they could carry from Dahlan's villa – furniture, pot plants and even the kitchen sink, complete with plumbing fixtures such as taps,"; and at the Muntada, Abbas's seafront presidential compound, witnesses reported seeing Hamas fighters remove computers, documents and guns.|$|E
2500|$|In a radio {{interview}} in July 2001, Ze'evi stated that 180,000 Palestinians worked and lived illegally in Israel. He described {{them as a}} [...] "cancer," [...] and said Israel should rid itself {{of those who were}} not Israeli citizens [...] "the same way you get rid of lice." [...] He called for denying the vote to Arab citizens who did not serve in the army. He believed that Jordan historically belonged to the Tribes of Israel – Gad, Reuven, and Menashe. Zeevi urged Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to [...] "lay waste to the Palestinian Authority" [...] and assassinate PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is married}} to Amina Abbas and they have had three sons. The eldest, Mazen Abbas, ran a {{building}} company in Doha and died in Qatar {{of a heart attack}} in 2001 at the age of 42. The kunya of Abu Mazen means [...] "father of Mazen." [...] Their second son is Yasser Abbas, a Canadian businessman who was named after former PA <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. The youngest son is Tareq, a business executive. Abbas has eight grandchildren, six of whom are part of the Seeds of Peace initiative bringing them in touch with young Israelis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, the Palestinian {{delegation}} to the Madrid International Peace Conference included many notables from Ramallah. As the Intifada wound down and the peace process moved forward, normal life in Ramallah resumed. On September 13, 1993 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian <b>Leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat shook hands at {{a meeting at the}} White House. Schoolchildren in Ramallah handed out olive branches to Israeli soldiers patrolling the streets. In December 1995, in keeping with the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated [...] "Area A" [...] under the accords.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Rabin was re-elected {{as prime}} {{minister}} on a platform embracing the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership {{as part of the}} Oslo Accords. [...] In 1994, Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize together with long-time political rival Shimon Peres and Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named Yigal Amir, who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Rabin was the first native-born prime minister of Israel, the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after Levi Eshkol. Rabin has become a symbol of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
2500|$|The Andrew and Mitrokhin {{publications}} briefly {{describe the}} history of the PLO <b>leader,</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, who established close collaboration with the Romanian Securitate service and the Soviet KGB in the early 1970s. The KGB provided secret training for PLO guerrillas. However, the main KGB activities and arms shipments were channeled through Wadie Haddad of the PFLP organization, who usually stayed in a KGB dacha BARVIKHA-1 during his visits to the Soviet Union. Led by Carlos the Jackal, a group of PFLP fighters carried out a spectacular raid on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries office in Vienna in 1975. Advance notice of this operation [...] "was almost certainly" [...] given to the KGB.|$|E
2500|$|After Israel {{took over}} the West Bank and Gaza {{following}} the 1967 Six-Day War, some American blacks supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and calling {{for the destruction of}} the Jewish state. Immediately after the war, the editor of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's (SNCC) newsletter wrote an article criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, [...] "Zionists conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres". This article led to conflict between Jews and the SNCC, but black SNCC leaders treated the war as a [...] "test of their willingness to demonstrate SNCC's break from its civil rights past".|$|E
