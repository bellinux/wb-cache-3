500|$|Pauline's {{marriage}} to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even {{after his death in}} 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear {{from the beginning of the}} programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that [...] " [...] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression." ...|$|E

"Miles is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{with lots}} of {{problems}} to work though,” Callaghan told itv.com. “He’s bordering on being an alcoholic {{and when you have}} a drink problem it’s always there {{in the back of your}} mind, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> demon.” ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{appeal was}} evidently {{addressed}} to the Lord Chancellor, who instantly replied, in a shrill monotone, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> repeating the alphabet, [...] "As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency, this portentous movement--" ...|$|E
60|$|With {{her father}} she was sweetest of all. And as {{he seemed to}} be pleased when she did {{anything}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> the habit of being like one insensibly grew on her.|$|E
60|$|He hopped {{over the}} barrier with {{unexpected}} activity, and sat beside Colonel Pound, kicking his short legs <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> on a gate. He {{began to tell}} the story as easily as if he were telling it to an old friend by a Christmas fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I {{mean to do}} others?" [...] Paul asked, {{looking up}} from his sofa at his erect inquisitor and feeling partly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> happy <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> when the school-master is gay, and partly like some pilgrim of old who might have {{consulted}} a world-famous oracle. St. George's own performance had been infirm, but as an adviser he would be infallible.|$|R
6000|$|Chester did {{not exactly}} <b>like</b> being called <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> But {{her voice and}} smile were irresistible and won his heart straightway. He took the candy with a shy, [...] "Thank you, ma'am," [...] and sat holding it in his hand.|$|R

He walked into Stalky for one hour--Stalky at {{attention}} {{in the middle of the}} floor, and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His Excellency's topknot in dumb show in the background. Stalky didn't dare to look up, or he'd have laughed." ...|$|R
60|$|He drank it. Then {{abruptly}} he {{sat down}} before the table, put his head on his arms, and began to sob and weep <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> in a perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie, {{as soon as}} she was at home, {{got down}} her Bible and puzzled herself for an hour over that riddle of Mr Stumfold's; but with all her trouble she could not find why St Peter in prison was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> with his shoes off.|$|E
60|$|A year before, {{involved}} in difficulties which it seemed no combination could control, and having nearly occasioned {{the occupation of}} Syria by a united French and English force, Fakredeen burst out a-cry-ing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> and came whimpering to Eva, as if somebody had broken his toy or given him a beating. Then it was that Eva had obtained for him a final assistance from her father, the condition being, that this application should be the last.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{hurried off}} like fools, quite {{inflated}} with our victory, to try {{if we could}} not chase the Austrians out of Dresden. They made a mockery of us from the tops of their mountains. So I have withdrawn, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> to conceal myself, out of spite, {{in one of the}} wretchedest villages in Saxony. And here the first thing will be to drive the Circle gentlemen (Reich's army) out of Freyberg into Chemnitz, and get ourselves soon to quarters, and something to live upon.|$|R
60|$|Besides all this, too, I {{noticed that}} while we were at sea, he wore nothing but old shabby clothes, very {{different}} from the glossy suit I had seen him in at our first interview, and after that {{on the steps of the}} City Hotel, where he always boarded when in New York. Now, he wore nothing but old-fashioned snuff-colored coats, with high collars and short waists; and faded, short-legged pantaloons, very tight about the knees; and vests, that did not conceal his waistbands, owing to their being so short, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy's.</b> And his hats were all caved in, and battered, as if they had been knocked about in a cellar; and his boots were sadly patched. Indeed, I began to think that he was but a shabby fellow after all; particularly as his whiskers lost their gloss, and he went days together without shaving; and his hair, by a sort of miracle, began to grow of a pepper and salt color, which might have been owing, though, to his discontinuing the use of some kind of dye while at sea. I put him down as a sort of impostor; and while ashore, a gentleman on false pretenses; for no gentleman would have treated another gentleman as he did me.|$|R
50|$|He is {{the school}} doctor. He has a bunch of toys who act like {{servants}} to him. Although he looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cute <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> every time he sees a girl who he likes, he transforms into an adult. Whenever anyone looks into his eyes when he's in his adult form, they turn into stone. (This can be solved by pouring boiling water on the statue). He is actually the descendant of the legendary Medusa. Semu, Hitomi, and Kurou's mother Miyako all have extensive collections of stuffed toys.|$|R
60|$|I replied shortly that I could, for Saduko's tone irritated me. Of course, {{the truth}} was that he felt aggrieved at being sent off to bed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> while his foster-father, the old dwarf, made confidences to me. One of Saduko's faults was that he had always a very good opinion of himself. Also he was by nature terribly jealous, even in little things, as the readers of his history, if any, will learn.|$|E
6000|$|How to quarrel {{well and}} often {{has ever been}} {{something}} of an art, and it becomes more of an art with the general decline of spirit. For {{it takes two to}} make a quarrel. Time was when you turned to the handiest human being, and with small care or labour had the comfortable warmth you needed in a minute or so. There was theology, even in the fifties it was ample cause with two out of three you met. Now people will express a lamentable indifference. Then politics again, but a little while ago fat for the fire of any male gathering, is now a topic of mere tepidity. So you are forced to be more subtle, more patient in your quarrelling. You play <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> playing cricket with his sisters, with those who do not understand. A fellow-votary is a rare treat. As a rule you have to lure and humour your antagonist like a child. The wooing is as intricate and delicate as any wooing can well be. To quarrel now, indeed, requires an infinity of patience. The good old days of thumb-biting--"Do you bite your thumbs at us, sir?" [...] and so to clash and stab--are gone for ever.|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{the more}} one {{explored}} Mr. Smith's holiday luggage, the less one could make anything of it. One peculiarity {{of it was}} that almost everything seemed to be there for the wrong reason; what is secondary with every one else was primary with him. He would wrap up a pot or pan in brown paper; and the unthinking assistant would discover that the pot was valueless or even unnecessary, and that it was the brown paper that was truly precious. He produced two or three boxes of cigars, and explained with plain and perplexing sincerity that he was no smoker, but that cigar-box wood was by far the best for fretwork. He also exhibited about six small bottles of wine, white and red, and Inglewood, happening to note a Volnay which he knew to be excellent, supposed at first that the stranger was an epicure in vintages. He was therefore surprised to find that the next bottle was a vile sham claret from the colonies, which even colonials (to do them justice) do not drink. It was only then that he observed that all six bottles had those bright metallic seals of various tints, and seemed to have been chosen solely because they have the three primary and three secondary colours: red, blue, and yellow; green, violet and orange. There grew upon Inglewood an almost creepy sense of the real childishness of this creature. For Smith was really, so far as human psychology can be, innocent. He had the sensualities of innocence: he loved the stickiness of gum, and he cut white wood greedily as if he were cutting a cake. To this man wine was not a doubtful thing to be defended or denounced; it was a quaintly coloured syrup, such as a child sees in a shop window. He talked dominantly and rushed the social situation; but he was not asserting himself, like a superman in a modern play. He was simply forgetting himself, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> at a party. He had somehow made the giant stride from babyhood to manhood, and missed that crisis in youth when most of us grow old.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg {{a million}} pardons," [...] cried Tom, {{and started to}} pick the books up, one after another. As he did this one hand went again into that pocket before {{mentioned}} and, on the sly, he inserted a printed sheet of paper into each book. [...] "Now you are all fixed, Tubbly," [...] he added. [...] "And you can run along to school <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> But wait <b>a</b> moment till I fix your collar," [...] he went on, as he turned the other youth around.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is sad," [...] {{continued}} the {{little old lady}} {{in a tone of}} contempt, [...] "that <b>a</b> youth <b>like</b> you should so much belie your looks. It was so mean of you to run away without a word of apology, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> for fear of being scolded--not that I cared much for being run down with that horrid bicycle, for I was not hurt--though I might have been killed--but it was the cowardly way in which you left me lying helpless among bakers, and sweeps, and policemen, and dirty boys. Oh! it was disgraceful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My uncle {{has talked}} him over. He {{always said that}} you were not {{sufficiently}} provided for. In the--the family disputes, when your mamma paid his debts so liberally, it was stipulated, I suppose, that you--that is, that I--that is, upon my word, I don't know why he goes out of Parliament," [...] Pen said, with rather a forced laugh. [...] "You see, Blanche, that you and I are two good little children, and that this marriage has been arranged for us by our mammas and uncles, and that we must be obedient, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> and girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{backward}} speculation, had it {{begun to}} play, however, {{would have been}} easily arrested; for it was at present to come over Amerigo as never before that his remarkable father-in-law was {{the man in the}} world least equipped with different appearances for different hours. He was simple, he was a revelation of simplicity, {{and that was the end}} of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at all--a question that might verily, for a weakness in it, have been argued. It amused our young man, who was taking his pleasure to-night, it will be seen, in sundry occult ways, it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of, resources, possessions, facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend, depended, for conveying the effect of quantity, on no personal [...] "equation," [...] no mere measurable medium. Quantity was in the air for these good people, and Mr. Verver's estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion. He was meagre and modest and clearbrowed, and his eyes, if they wandered without fear, yet stayed without defiance; his shoulders were not broad, his chest was not high, his complexion was not fresh, and the crown of his head was not covered; in spite of all of which he looked, at the top of his table, so nearly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank, that he COULD only be one of the powers, the representative of a force--quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty. In this generalised view of his father-in-law, intensified to-night but always operative, Amerigo had now for some time taken refuge. The refuge, after the reunion of the two households in England, had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities, from man to man, that, by his original calculation, might have become possible, but that had not really ripened and flowered. He met the decent family eyes across the table, met them afterwards in the music-room, but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months, the time of over-anxious initiation, a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute. This directed regard rested at its ease, but it neither lingered nor penetrated, and was, to the Prince's fancy, much of the same order as any glance directed, for due attention, from the same quarter, to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker. It made sure of the amount--and just so, from time to time, the amount of the Prince was made sure. He was being thus, in renewed instalments, perpetually paid in; he already reposed in the bank as a value, but subject, in this comfortable way, to repeated, to infinite endorsement. The net result of all of which, moreover, was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish. He himself, after all, had not fixed it--the [...] "figure" [...] was a conception all of Mr. Verver's own. Certainly, however, everything must be kept up to it; never so much as to-night had the Prince felt this. He would have been uncomfortable, as these quiet expressions passed, had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with Charlotte. It was impossible that he should not now and again meet Charlotte's eyes, as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husband's. For her as well, in all his pulses, he felt the conveyed impression. It put them, it kept them together, through the vain show of their separation, made the two other faces, made the whole lapse of the evening, the people, the lights, the flowers, the pretended talk, the exquisite music, a mystic golden bridge between them, strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous, for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of [...] "care," [...] would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound.|$|E

5000|$|During Udall's {{tenure as}} Secretary of the Interior, in September 1962, he was summoned {{unexpectedly}} into {{a meeting with}} Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev while {{on a tour of}} the Soviet Union. It was during this meeting that Khrushchev famously hinted at his secret deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba by telling Udall: [...] "It's been a long time since you could spank us <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> Now we can swat your ass." [...] This was a prelude to the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
500|$|Len Jones as Joe McClaine, {{a nine-year-old}} adoptee who {{balances}} schoolwork with missions {{as a spy}} for the World Intelligence Network (WIN), using the aid of knowledge and experience captured by a brilliant invention, the Brain Impulse [...] Record And Transfer (BIG RAT). For realism, Joe is voiced by child actor Jones rather than an actress as had usually been {{the case for the}} representation of younger characters on earlier Supermarionation series. On the subject of female casting, Gerry Anderson recalled, [...] "...it always sounded rather odd to me. It never sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real <b>little</b> <b>boy...</b> With Joe 90, I suggested finding a British kid and making him repeat the lines parrot fashion. That's what we did with Len Jones. His performance was only adequate, but at least it sounded authentic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> to have asked it." [...] Ludlow did not profit by the chance which the {{conclusion}} of their agreement offered him, to go. He stayed and talked on, {{and from time to}} time he recurred to what he had asked, and said he was afraid she would think he was using her, and tried to explain that he really was not, but was approaching her most humbly for her opinion. He could not make it out, but they got better and better acquainted in the fun they had with his failures. It went on till Cornelia said, [...] "Now, really, if you keep it up, I shall have to stand you in the corner, with your face to the wall." ...|$|R
60|$|However, Mr. Casaubon {{consented to}} listen and teach for <b>an</b> hour together, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{schoolmaster}} of <b>little</b> <b>boys,</b> or rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lover, to whom a mistress's elementary ignorance and difficulties have a touching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching the alphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got to some timid questions {{about the value of}} the Greek accents gave her a painful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable of explanation to a woman's reason.|$|R
5000|$|Pinocchio {{is always}} shown {{as a very}} short person with short dark hair, but other {{specifics}} of his appearance {{vary depending on the}} artist. In [...] "A Wolf in the Fold" [...] and [...] "Around the Town," [...] he is drawn as a typical prepubescent child with a slender frame and a receding chin, but most other chapters show him with thick shoulders, a square jaw and a heavy brow. Nevertheless, in [...] "A Two-Part Caper," [...] Bigby describes Pinocchio as looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Terry {{was born}} in {{and grew up in}} Hertfordshire, north of London, and persuaded his parents to let him attend acting classes when he was five years old. He made his stage debut the {{following}} year in a regional production of Turgenev's A Month in the Country. In 1994 his father heard about the auditions for a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children's novel James and the Giant Peach, and thought his son would be perfect: [...] "Like James", he said, [...] "Paul can act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> lost." ...|$|E
5000|$|The role of Bosko was {{to serve}} as a cartoony version of Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer (1927). According to Ising, he was {{initially}} supposed to be an [...] "inkspot sort of thing". He was not conceived as either a human or an animal, though behaving <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> According to Leonard Maltin, Bosko was a cartoonized version of a young black boy who spoke a Southern dialect of African American Vernacular English. He cites as an example a phrase from Bosko's Holiday, said with an intermittent drawl: [...] "I sho'done likes picnics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I cannot. I cannot. I would. But I cannot. The Borghesia--the citizens--the bourgeoisie, {{they are}} the ones who can. Oh, yes. The bourgeoisie, the shopkeepers, these serve their wives so, and their wives love them. They are the marital maquereaux--the husband-maquereau, you know. Their wives are so stout and happy, and they dote on their husbands and always betray them. So it is with the bourgeoise. She loves her husband so much, and is always seeking to betray him. Or she is a Madame Bovary, seeking for a scandal. But the bourgeois husband, he goes on being the same. He is the horse, and she the driver. And when she says gee-up, you know--then he comes ready, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hired maquereau. Only he feels so good, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> at her breast.

And till the end of time young folk (who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and men) will struggle as I did, and make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and the course of events will push them upon the one side and go on <b>like</b> <b>a</b> marching army. James was hanged; and here was I, dwelling in the house of Prestongrange, and grateful to him for his fatherly attention. He was hanged; and behold! when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my beaver to him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> before his dominie. He had been hanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and there was not a pennyweight of difference; and the villains of that horrid plot were decent, kind, respectable fathers of families, who went to kirk and took the sacrament! ...|$|R
2500|$|Their public falling-out {{followed}} {{years of}} tight control by Frank.

On his father's death in May 1974, the family estate, valued at A$100 million passed directly to Kerry. In 1976, Clyde sold his quarter-share of the family business for A$4 million to Kerry, {{who went on to}} become Australia's richest man.|$|R
