5|$|The 19th century saw {{improvements}} to Somerset's roads {{with the introduction}} of turnpikes, and the building of canals and railways. Nineteenth-century canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803.|$|E
5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is ionized {{in the stomach}} after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

5|$|In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset {{coalfield}} was {{an important}} industry, and {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|For the live-action {{portion of}} the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the {{rotoscope}} models acted out their parts in costume. During {{the middle of a}} large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined.|$|E

25|$|In the 1850s W. and H.M. Goulding built a large {{factory in}} The Glen {{that was used}} to make {{phosphate}} fertilizers and the area became known as Goulding's Glen. The factory closed and was demolished in the mid-20th century and very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> remains today. The land was donated to the people of Cork by Sir Basil Goulding in the late 1960s and was subsequently developed as an amenity park.|$|E
25|$|Hoxha's death left Albania with {{a legacy}} of {{isolation}} and fear of the outside world. Despite some economic progress made by Hoxha, the country was in economic stagnation; Albania had been the poorest European country {{throughout much of the}} Cold War period. Following the transition to capitalism in 1992, Hoxha's legacy diminished, so that by the early 21st century very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was still in place in Albania.|$|E

25|$|Although Gherardello was renowned {{during his}} time for his sacred music, <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has survived. A Gloria and an Agnus Dei, both by Gherardello, are among {{just a handful of}} mass {{movements}} by Italian composers from before 1400. The style of Gherardello's mass movements {{is similar to that of}} the madrigal, although more restrained emotionally: they are for two voices, which sing together most of the time, with occasional passages where they sing in alternation.|$|E
25|$|The densest forest lands lie in {{the eastern}} part of the state. In {{particular}} the Big Thicket region, just north of Houston and Beaumont, has historically been home to the most dense woodlands. The Big Thicket was mostly uninhabited until heavy settlement from the U.S. began in the mid-19th century, and was even used as a refuge by runaway slaves and other fugitives. The Rio Grande valley in South Texas was home to a large palm tree forest when Spaniards first arrived, though today very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> remains.|$|E
25|$|C-banding: Giemsa binds to {{constitutive}} heterochromatin, so it stains centromeres.The name {{is derived}} from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds {{a lot of the}} dye, {{while the rest of the}} chromosomes absorb only <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|Hickley was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman {{who had a}} {{long career}} in amateur cricket, though very <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was at first-class level.

He played in minor matches for both Western Province and Cape Colony against Walter Read's cricket team the following season, and against a similar touring side in India, led by Lord Hawke in 1893-94.|$|E
25|$|Ozone in the {{stratosphere}} is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240nm in the Herzberg bands, {{but most of the}} oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong Schumann–Runge bands between 200 and 160nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.|$|E
25|$|Wert wrote a {{considerable}} amount of sacred music, but <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was published during his lifetime. He published only three books of motets, one in 1566 and the other two in 1581; a few of his works, such as the Missa Dominicalis appeared in anthologies with the music of other composers. His other six masses remained in manuscript, as did the majority of the music he wrote for Santa Barbara in Mantua. Most likely this was because he was commissioned to write that music, such as his cycle of 127 hymns, specifically for that institution, and his publisher was in Venice.|$|E

25|$|The main {{building}} material is Kentish rag-stone, though some local mudstone was also used. Although <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> survives, Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide {{details in the}} Tower's facing, much of it replaced by Portland stone in the 17thand 18thcenturies {{under the direction of}} architect Inigo Jones. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18thcentury, only two original– albeit restored– examples remain, in the south wall at gallery level. The White Tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.|$|E
25|$|House mice {{primarily}} feed on plant matter, {{but they}} will also accept meat and dairy products. Meats are full of protein and are great for pregnant or nursing mice. They will drink water but require <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> relying mainly on the moisture present in their food. If a water source is provided, then a gravity bottle feeder is necessary for maintaining the cleanliness of the water supply. They will eat their feces to acquire nutrients produced by bacteria in their intestines in a behavior they share with rabbits and guinea pigs called coprophagy. House mice, like other rodents, do not vomit.|$|E
