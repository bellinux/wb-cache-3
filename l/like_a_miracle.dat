500|$|Hoffman {{was baptized}} a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} mass as a child, {{but did not}} have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, leaving the children to be raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, [...] "I was changed– permanently changed– by that experience. It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of Quilters and Alms for the Middle Class, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member.|$|E

His study is also posted on the Slate website. Kleiman criticized the promoters of the program, saying [...] "Anything that selects out from a group of ex-inmates those who hold jobs is going to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> cure" [...] and [...] "The InnerChange cheerleaders simply ignored the other 102 participants who dropped out, were kicked out or got early parole and didn't finish. If you select out the winners, you leave mostly losers." [...] Chuck Colson responded to Kleiman's article. Colson accused the article of being an attack against Bush and his promotion of faith-based programs. Scott Nowell of the Houston Press said that [...] "Colson didn't really address Kleiman's argument of selection bias." ...|$|E
2500|$|As his agent's {{plans are}} realized, Tender's fame grows. These plans include the {{publication}} of Tender's [...] "autobiography" [...] and the [...] "Book of Very Common Prayer", {{as well as the}} conversion of the former Creedish land into the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill (a [...] repository for America's outdated porn). Tender is constantly waiting for the opportune moment to kill himself, and continually puts it off as circumstances fail to meet his criteria. Then, as his popularity starts to wane, the agent tells him that he needs to perform a miracle in order to stay famous. It is then that Fertility finds Tender and gives him a prediction to make on TV that will seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> when it comes true. Naturally, it does, and Tender's fame swells to even greater proportions. It is unclear at this point why Fertility has shown up and decided to help.|$|E

5000|$|Film critic Dan Callahan {{praised the}} film's cinematography, story, {{direction}} and acting. He wrote, [...] "Every magic hour, light-drenched image in Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive {{is filled with}} mysterious dread....There's something voluptuous about the cinematography, and this suits the sense of emerging sexuality in the girls, especially in the scene where Isabel speculatively paints her lips with blood from her own finger...and Torrent, with her severe, beautiful little face, provides an eerily unflappable presence to center the film. The one time she smiles, it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small <b>miracle,</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of grace amid the uneasiness of black cats, hurtling black trains, devouring fire and poisonous mushrooms. These signs of dismay haunt the movie." ...|$|R

60|$|About {{the prime}} {{of the day the}} hounds started, of a sudden, a very {{wonderful}} stag. For it was white and its horns were gilded very bright, shining like pure gold, so that the creature itself appeared <b>like</b> <b>a</b> living <b>miracle</b> in the forest. When this stag broke cover, the hounds immediately set chase to it with a great outcry of yelling, as though they were suddenly gone frantic, and when the King beheld the creature, he also was immediately seized as with a great fury for chasing it. For, beholding it, he shouted aloud and drove spurs into his horse, and rushed away at such a pass that his court was, in a little while, left altogether behind him, and he and the chase were entirely alone in the forest.|$|R
40|$|A {{major theme}} {{in my career}} has been photophosphorylation; {{especially}} contributions to the early work on chemios-mosis, and later involvement in CF 1 activation and function. A second theme has been interest in chloroplast biogenesis, with work ranging from translation in chloroplasts to discovery of the enzyme which may contribute to strand exchange, homologous recombination and DNA repair in chloroplasts. Throughout, I try {{to point out the}} major contributions of graduate students and postdocs, and help from friends and colleagues. Without them I would have had no career at all. The perspective for these recollections comes from the underlying theme in at least one book by Stanislaw Lem (1978). The probability of any one event oc-curring is amazingly small; in retrospect, each step seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> minor <b>miracle.</b> Any person’s career has to be shaped by interactions with other people; mine was certainly very much shaped by faculty colleagues, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students.

"He was {{preparing}} to hang Dr. Monygham (whom he had on board) {{at the end of}} the after-derrick, when the first of Barrios's transports, one of our own ships at that, steamed right in, and ranging close alongside opened a small-arm fire without as much preliminaries as a hail. It was the completest surprise in the world, sir. They were too astounded at first to bolt below. Men were falling right and left <b>like</b> ninepins. It's <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that Monygham, standing on the after-hatch with the rope already round his neck, escaped being riddled through and through <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sieve. He told me since that he had given himself up for lost, and kept on yelling with all the strength of his lungs: 'Hoist a white flag! Hoist a white flag!' Suddenly an old major of the Esmeralda regiment, standing by, unsheathed his sword with a shriek: 'Die, perjured traitor!' and ran Sotillo clean through the body, just before he fell himself shot through the head." ...|$|R

5000|$|Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com wrote, [...] "At Middleton is {{the just}} the sort of trite if inoffensive {{diversion}} that barely tiptoes into theaters before landing in the cable and video on demand listings. And Garcia and Farmiga, as good as they can be in the right roles, aren't doing themselves or their careers any favors with this sort of C-level effort. At least the ending is brazen enough not to conclude in a tidy fashion. But watching George and Edith cavort in slo-mo while being drenched in a campus fountain is antithesis of enjoying Annie Hall and Alvy Singer as those classic polar opposites engage in battle against a runaway lobster. One scene has comic snap. The other is merely soggy." [...] Vulture critic Bilge Ebiri gave a positive review, stating, [...] "At Middleton is a modest movie with modest aims, but at times it feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small <b>miracle.</b> <b>A</b> daylong romance starring Andy García and Vera Farmiga as two parents who meet cute while their kids tour the same small college, it takes a relatively undistinguished premise and sets itself apart with details that ring true.

It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> living <b>miracle,</b> this animal, to me, because if there's an animal on earth that can defeat the snake—a venomous viper—with a bite, I think that there's got to be some way for us to defeat, or to bite the neck of hatred in this world, no? [...] "It's called the Tour of the Mongoose, and the mongoose is basically one of the few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite and that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle."
