Article 19 expressly excluded from the scope of the convention certain activities of state armed forces and of self-determination movements as follows: 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.2. The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of any wire obstacle is greatly increased by planting anti-tank and blast antipersonnel mines {{in and around}} it. Additionally, connecting bounding anti-personnel mines (e.g. the PROM-1) to the obstacle with tripwires {{has the effect of}} booby-trapping the obstacle itself, hindering attempts to clear it. Dummy tripwires can be added to cause further confusion. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is very easy to connect hand-grenades to the wire using trip-wires. If the use of <b>lethal</b> explosive <b>devices</b> is deemed to be unsuitable, it is easy to emplace tripflares in and around the wire obstacle in order to make night-time infiltration harder.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{anti-trapping}} {{initiatives that}} occurred during 1992 – 2000, the overall national trend has been less restrictive trapping regulations as they apply to cable-restraint devices. We believe this policy shift among state wildlife agencies has been influenced by two different events. The first relates to advances in trap technology and trapping methods. Nowhere has this change been {{more evident than in}} the liberalization of snaring regulations for the capture of beaver. Even land-based snaring has been expanded as development of break-away devices and setting strategies have increased snare performance to capture target-species, and do so without lethal effects. The second event was the development of reliable trap-testing research, such as that performed by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, which documented the remarkable advances made by trap manufacturers and in trapping techniques. In light of these developments, it is indeed a conundrum why more states, particularly on the eastern seaboard, have not updated their regulations to permit broader use of cable-restraints. One suspects, however, that the lack of modernization of the regulations stems from the erroneous and outdated reputation that snares are by definition <b>lethal</b> <b>devices</b> and therefore dangerous. Improved education and dissemination of facts should help dispel this incomplete view of snares and cable-restraints. We hope readers will find this information useful as they work for the responsible management of wildlife resources...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the critical}} connections between drones as <b>lethal</b> technological <b>devices,</b> visibility, {{and the very}} possibility of politics. Drawing on Hannah Arendt’s core postulates on politics, modern security and society, it problematises {{the political implications of}} using drones as a prominent security instrument in contemporary life. This reading is unpacked through the concept of visibility as a critical reference to analyse how security policies are dealt with politically. It suggests that drones have operated as an instrument of double invisibility, both to those living in the contexts where they are employed, and to those under whose name they are being used. The consequences of this invisibility for political life and the practice of security are also discussed {{in the light of the}} policy under the Obama administration...|$|R

The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a <b>lethal</b> weapon. These <b>devices</b> were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that {{it probably would have}} brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|R

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a HC2c. with Company M, in connection with operations against enemy aggressor forces. During the afternoon hours, Company M was moving to join the remainder of the 3d Battalion in Quang Tri Province. After treating and evacuating 2 heat casualties, HC2c. Ballard was returning to his platoon from the evacuation landing zone when the company was ambushed by a North Vietnamese Army unit employing automatic weapons and mortars, and sustained numerous casualties. Observing a wounded marine, HC2c. Ballard unhesitatingly moved across the fire swept terrain to the injured man and swiftly rendered medical assistance to his comrade. HC2c. Ballard then directed 4 marines to carry the casualty to a position of relative safety. As the 4 men prepared to move the wounded marine, an enemy soldier suddenly left his concealed position and, after hurling a hand grenade which landed near the casualty, commenced firing upon the small group of men. Instantly shouting a warning to the marines, HC2c. Ballard fearlessly threw himself upon the <b>lethal</b> explosive <b>device</b> to protect his comrades from the deadly blast. When the grenade failed to detonate, he calmly arose from his dangerous position and resolutely continued his determined efforts in treating other marine casualties. HC2c. Ballard's heroic actions and selfless concern for the welfare of his companions served to inspire all who observed him and prevented possible injury or death to his fellow marines. His courage, daring initiative, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of extreme personal danger, sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundCardiac device-related {{endocarditis}} (CDE) {{is a major}} {{complication of}} the implantation of a pacemaker and defibrillator. The experience in a single high-volume tertiary center is reported. MethodsThirty one years (1980 – 2011) of cases of CDE were analyzed retrospectively and compared to overall insertion data; the clinical course and management strategies of these patients have been reviewed. ResultsA total of 23 cases (16 male, median age 72 years) were identified, 20 of these cases were determined at our institution where 5287 procedures were performed (endocarditis rate 0. 38 %). Thirteen patients were determined to have a cardiac device pocket infection. Infection in 7 cases (30 %) was caused by lead(s). However, in 16 cases (70 %) both leads and the pocket of devices were the reason of infection. Median time was 13. 5 months for presentation. Patients who had undergone the last procedure within 6 months were admitted earlier than those with longer post procedure time (p< 0. 05). Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated lead vegetations in 13 of the 16 cases (81 %). Organisms were identified in 18 cases (78 %) — 78 % Staphylococci (56 % Staphylococcus aureus). Leads of the device were removed in 17 cases (74 %); seven cases by percutaneous simple traction and 10 cases by sternotomy. Six major complications attributable to device-related endocarditis were observed: four deaths (mortality 17. 4 %); one splenic abscess requiring splenectomy; and one septic pulmonary embolism; median follow-up 49 months. ConclusionA CDE endocarditis rate of 0. 38 % was demonstrated. It remains a rare but potentially <b>lethal</b> complication of <b>device</b> implantation...|$|R

The model was used to assess how RTP varied with coverage when eave tubes were used as a stand-alone intervention, or in combination with either bed nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS). Results: The model indicated the impact of eave tubes on transmission increases non-linearly as coverage increases, suggesting a community level benefit. For example, based on realistic assumptions, just 30 % coverage resulted in around 70 % reduction in overall RTP (i. e. there was a benefit for those houses without eave tubes). Increasing coverage to around 70 % reduced overall RTP by > 90 %. Eave tubes exhibited some redundancy with existing interventions, such that combining interventions within properties did not give reductions in RTP equal to the sum of those provided by deploying each intervention singly. However, combining eave tubes and either LLINs or IRS could be extremely effective if the technologies were deployed in a non-overlapping way. Conclusion: Using predictive models to assess the benefit of new technologies has great value, and is especially pertinent prior to conducting expensive, large scale, randomized controlled trials. The current modelling study indicates eave tubes have considerable potential to impact malaria transmission if deployed at scale and can be used effectively with existing tools, especially if they are combined strategically with, for example, IRS and eave tubes targeting different houses...|$|R
