All the formal districts of Austria-Hungary used to rely on each other's exports for growth and welfare; by contrast, 5 years after the treaty, traffic of goods between the countries dropped to less than 5% of its former value.

Technically price liberalisation is easy to implement: the government simply announces that all agents can set their own prices from a certain date. The problem is political: necessary price liberalisation leads to income redistribution, and political and social frictions. In order to prevent a sharp rise in inflation, any resetting of prices has to be complemented by certain steps. Namely, a competitive environment should exist before actual price liberalisation. This assumes extensive privatisation and restructuralisation programs in the former centrally planned economies. ...|$|R

The addition of territory to the existing Prussian state made elimination <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> a powerful factor in Prussian politics.

Manufactured goods were heavily taxed, especially textiles, and the most important taxes were for food, necessities and luxury goods.|$|R

2500|$|It was in 1864 {{that the}} destiny of Cerbère was to change. [...] In this year, an {{agreement}} was signed between Spain and France to build a rail link between the two countries, leading {{to the construction of}} two frontier stations at Portbou and at Cerbère. The international tunnel was inaugurated in 1876, the tracks laid and the international station opened in 1878. [...] Traffic was immediately important, and led to a rapid growth of population. The rail infrastructure grew to a considerable size, since the differing track gauges in Spain and France necessitated moving all merchandise between trains - simpler than changing the axles. The growth in population led naturally {{to the creation of the}} commune of Cerbère (1889), which had 1428 inhabitants in the census of 1891. The population did not stop growing until 1962, when it reached 2438. Growth was reversed from this date for several reasons : mechanisation on the railway (notably the changing of axles), growth of road transport, and abolition <b>of</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>barriers.</b> However, the economic role of Cerbère is far from being negligible: in 1998, the station handled a total of 2,500,000 tonnes of merchandise. In the freight yard, 350 to 700 wagons are handled daily, whether by changing axles (13 trains a day) or with dual axles (10 trains a day). For passengers, the number of trains serving the station varies from 18 to 47 a day depending on season. [...] Annually, 15,000 trains pass through Cerbère station.|$|R

Having succeeded in concluding a military pact with Belgium, France had no further need of Luxembourg. Since the beginning of the war, the Belgian authorities had shown annexationist tendencies towards the Grand Duchy. In 1917, France renounced any ambitions with regards to Luxembourg, but kept this secret from the Luxembourgish government, in order to conceal the intentions of the French negotiators. After the war, France intended {{to take advantage of the}} Luxembourg question, by obtaining from Belgium the conclusion of a military pact. After the French announcement, the Luxembourgish government re-started negotiations with Belgium. These were slow-going, but resulted on 25 July 1921 in the signing of a treaty on a customs and monetary union between the two countries. The Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union came into force in March 1922. The treaty stipulated the abolition <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> between the two countries, a common external tariff, a common trade policy led by Belgium and a currency association. The Belgian franc became the common currency, while Luxembourg however retained its right to print Luxembourgish notes. The economic union was never a perfect one, as the treaty did not require the harmonisation of tax systems.|$|R

With the loss of the German market, Luxembourgish viticulture had to adapt itself. The existing grape varieties had to be gotten rid of, to be replaced by varieties that would yield quality wines. Elbling made way for Riesling-Sylbaner, Riesling, Pinot, and Auxerrois. At the same time the vine-growing surface area was substantially reduced, getting rid of the low-quality sites. The surface area went from 1,645 ha in 1914 to 1,000 ha in 1939.|$|R

60|$|There is {{also another}} system in China, chiefly {{inherited}} {{from the time of}} the Taiping rebellion, namely the erection <b>of</b> internal <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> at various important points. This plan is still adopted with the internal trade. But merchants dealing with the interior and sending goods to or from a Treaty Port can escape internal customs by the payment of half the duty charged under the external tariff. As this is generally less than the internal tariff charges, this provision favours foreign produce at the expense of that of China. Of course the system <b>of</b> internal <b>customs</b> is bad, but it is traditional, and is defended on the ground that revenue is indispensable. China offered to abolish internal customs in return for certain uniform increases in the import and export tariff, and Great Britain, Japan, and the United States consented. But there were ten other Powers whose consent was necessary, and not all could be induced to agree. So the old system remains in force, not chiefly through the fault of the Chinese central government. It should be added that internal customs are collected by the provincial authorities, who usually intercept them and use them for private armies and civil war. At the present time, the Central Government is not strong enough to stop these abuses.|$|R

O Brasil abriga, atualmente, os principais grupos mundiais do segmento automobilístico, o que incrementa as exportações no setor. Recente estudo do Banco Mundial demonstra que enquanto os produtos brasileiros levam em média 39 dias para serem liberados, no restante do mundo, este trâmite é de apenas 27 dias. Para solucionar este problema, surgiu em 1997 o regime aduaneiro RECOF. O objetivo do presente artigo é analisar as vantagens logísticas e tributárias obtidas com a implantação deste regime no setor automobilístico. Trata-se de uma pesquisa aplicada e exploratória, cujo procedimento metodológico foi o estudo de caso.

40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{tendency}} for the Romanian retailing {{to adapt to the}} requirements of the international market. If in the years following Romania’s adherence to capitalism the indigenous retailing was marked by a strong segmentation in small retail units with low turnover, retail chains were considerably developed. The domestic market began to be penetrated by the first European retail chains in the mid-nineties of the last century. That was the spark of the change, to which many of the players in the retail sector were not able to adapt. During this period one can notice, on the one hand, a decrease in the majority shareholding of state-owned capital in favor of private capital and, on the other hand, a decrease {{in the value of the}} public sector and an increase in the value of the private sector. Romania’s accession to the European Union and the removal <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> to the merchandise brought from other member states represented for retailers the long-expected signal of progressive expansion. After going through the stage of consolidation and intra and inter-organizational learning in Bucharest and a few important cities, new subsidiaries were subsequently opened in most of the county towns. Whereas most retailers promised to open a considerable number of subsidiaries in the period of economic expansion, in the last years their activity has been on the decline, being focused mainly on solidifying their own position on the market through mergers or acquisitions as well as exhibiting a central tendency to focus heavily on price and customer attraction. Based on secondary sources of information, the present paper attempts to make a diagnosis-type analysis of the evolution of the retail market in Romania by highlighting the ways in which the western retail networks were adapted to the Romanian market as well as the strategies resorted to by the local networks in their attempt to overcome the economic crisis and deal successfully with the ever-decreasing income of the customers. ...|$|R

40|$|Convegno internazionale organizzato da: Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore di Milano – London School of Economics and Political Science. The {{tendency}} towards internationalisation {{has played}} a key role in the lastfew decades in the economic and industrial environment. The reduction and, in many cases the elimination <b>of</b> <b>customs</b> <b>barriers,</b> along with the opportunity to transfer capital abroad have created new strategic opportunities, a growing expansion of the market economy on a worldwide scale and major processes of change affecting both capitalist economies and enterprises. In this context national borders tend to play an increasingly limited role as demarcation boundaries of economic areas, and no longer offer adequate protection to enterprises that fail to pay sufficient attention to efficiency and effectiveness. Competition has become global. This phenomenon is the result of the combination of four main factors: the spread of technology, removal of barriers between countries, convergence of demand, and development of transport and communications. In this scenario enterprises find themselves operating in increasingly large, open markets, where it is fundamental for them to increase their ability to competitive, minimise fluctuations, defend their markets and seek better sources for procuring raw materials, labour and services. At the same time, they have to take into account the influence of the framework and competition of the industry in which they work. The transition to a global mentality is not an easy one, as it requires the introduction of far-reaching processes of innovation that are often difficult to manage, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Globalisation of the economy has even introduced the problem of the survival of smaller enterprises, particularly because economies of scale, technology, research and development are not generally widespread in SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). On this basis some researchers have claimed that small enterprises focusing on local markets or which have an approach to internationalisation founded on the ‘personalisation’ of products rather than on their ‘globalisation and standardisation’ will inevitably face many serious problems in competing internationally. For others, phenomena such as downsizing, process outsourcing, expansion of reticular models, increase in the number of spin-offs (but also spin-in partnerships), growth of franchising, and more generally, mechanisms of ‘enterprise creation by means of enterprises’ all ‘combine to create the impression of a form of production organisation that definitely favours smaller sized companies. Aside from these different positions, it is clear and generally accepted that there is a need for SMEs to adopt completely new approaches to management and organisation, particularly in Italy, if they are to break into foreign markets, and also to survive on local markets...|$|R

The last step of this integrating process was represented by the adoption of a common currency that really transformed the Union area in a unique market. The adoption of a common currency represented the main care versus the integration process. The reason of this care is that it really represents the first step towards the giving up of some intrinsic privileges in the sovereignty of a State. These steps are (and will be) requisite for a full achievement of the European Union aims. Nevertheless, some recent national events showed how much that unconfessed fear was undoubtly well-grounded. A first unexpected effect of the introduction of Euro is the possibility to outline all the persistent differences between States in a more effective way. These differences enable also to identify the heterogeneous conditions of economic, political, social and cultural behavior of each Country.

In a current international context like the one that we are facing nowadays, banks play a crucial role in enabling international trade by guaranteeing international payments and reducing the risks in trade transactions. This paper consists of a brief analysis of the use of Letters of Credit in order to avoid the default risk, since the Letter of Credit is a very common means of payment used both in export and import operations. This study focuses on the Documentary Credit as a means of payment and it is also a study of the implications for the banks in this process. It deals with the role of banks in the processing of Letters of Credit. Specifically, this short study tries to analyze an export operation from Spain to Lebanon that has been processed with Banco Santander and that resulted in the non-payment of the amount established by the L/C due to an incorrect processing performed by the bank. The paper aims at underlining the importance of documents in international trade as well as the fact that it is of crucial importance to respect all the information established by the Documentary Credit.
