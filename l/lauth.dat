25|$|The best-known jazz {{groups in}} West Germany were the quintets of Albert Mangelsdorff (with Heinz Sauer and Günter Kronberg), Michael Naura (with Wolfgang Schlüter), and the quartet of Klaus Doldinger (with Ingfried Hoffmann.) Innovators {{were also the}} <b>Lauth</b> Wolfgang quartet (with Fritz Hartschuh) and the trio of Wolfgang Dauner (with Eberhard Weber and Fred Braceful). Musically there was a {{deliberate}} but careful delineation of the American model. With their growing popularity, Doldinger and Mangelsdorff could also perform abroad and publish records. Naura had to retire from active life as a musician because of illness, and later became {{an editor of the}} Jazz part of the NDR (Northern German Broadcast). For the GDR, the Manfred Ludwig sextet has to be mentioned, originally for a long time the only band, which turned to the style of modern jazz.|$|E

50|$|Thionine, {{also known}} as <b>Lauth's</b> violet, is the salt of a heterocyclic compound. A variety of salts are known {{including}} the chloride and acetate, called respectively thionine chloride and thionine acetate. The dye is structurally related to methylene blue, which also features a phenothiazine core. The dye's name is frequently misspelled, with omission of the e. The -ine ending indicates that the compound is an amine.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "gentian violet" [...] (or Gentianaviolett in German) {{is thought}} to have been {{introduced}} by the German pharmacist Georg Grübler, who in 1880 started a company in Leipzig that specialized in the sale of staining reagents for histology. The gentian violet stain marketed by Grübler probably contained a mixture of methylated pararosaniline dyes. The stain proved popular and in 1884 was used by Hans Christian Gram to stain bacteria. He credited Paul Ehrlich for the aniline-gentian violet mixture. Grübler's gentian violet was probably very similar, if not identical, to <b>Lauth's</b> methyl violet, which had been used as a stain by Victor André Cornil in 1875.|$|R
2500|$|On West German television, {{the great}} American musicians were {{introduced}} to audiences during prime time. Around 1960, Western music producers' interest in recording musicians such as Wolfgang <b>Lauth</b> waned, as jazz music no longer {{seemed to be a}} good sale. In 1964, Horst Lippmann had noted: [...] "The German record industry neglected all modern German jazz musicians and only occasionally presented records with amateur Dixieland bands in the area. No German record company seems to be prepared for the artistic obligation to publish modern German jazz appropriate as it is the case in the field of symphonic and chamber music." [...] Shortly thereafter, as if this appeal had been heard and had caused a new generation of jazz producers (such as Siegfried Loch, and Hans-Georg Brunner Schwer) to emerge, records by Klaus Doldinger, Albert Mangelsdorff, but also by Attila Zoller or Wolfgang Dauner came onto the market.|$|E

40|$|These {{studies were}} carried out in an attempt to {{elucidate}} the mode of action of the drug phenothiazine. The first record of phenothiazine (thiodiphenylamine) appears with its synthesis in 1885 by Bernthsen, in his studies on compounds of the methylene blue group. It gives rise to many dyes, the most important being methylene blue, <b>Lauth’s</b> violet, and thionol. Phenothiazine is a soft, smooth powder of talc-like consistency, slightly off yellowish-white in colour. It has a faint but characteristic odour and taste. It is highly insoluble in water, but readily soluble in the fat solvents, alcohol, xylol, toluol, ether, chloroform. From these it crystallizes out in flat plates. The melting point of pure phenothiazine is 184 °C.; the commercial product used as the drug melts at 180 - 181 °C. The molecular weight is 199. 4 [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} modification of hydrophobic polymer matrices {{is an alternative}} way to elchange their surface properties. The introduction of sulfonic groups in the polymer changes the surface properties such as adhesion, wettability, catalytic ability, and adsorption capacity. This work describes the production and application of chemically modified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as adsorbent for dyes removal. Chemical modification of PVC was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis, which indicated the presence of sulfonic groups on PVC. The chemically modified PVC (PVCDS) showed an ion exchange capacity of 1. 03 mmol− 1, and efficiently removed the thionine dye (<b>Lauth’s</b> violet) from aqueous solutions, reaching equilibrium in 30 min. The adsorption kinetics was better adjusted for a pseudo second order model. This result indicates that the adsorption of thionine onto PVCDS occurs by chemisorption. Among the models {{for the state of}} equilibrium, SIPS and Langmuir exhibited the best fit to the experimental results and PVCDS showed high adsorption capacities (370 mg− 1). Thus, it is assumed that the system presents homogeneous characteristics to the distribution of active sites. The modification promoted the formation of surface characteristics favorable to the dye adsorption by the polymer...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the equilibrium swelling and sorption properties of chemically crosslinked copolymeric hydrogels as biopotential sorbent consisting of acrylamide (AAm) and 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic acid (AMPS). Semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi IPNs) hydrogel, composed of AAm with AMPS as co-monomer, with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a multifunctional crosslinker such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) was prepared. AAm/AMPS hydrogels and AAm/AMPS/PEG semi IPNs were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization by using ammonium persulphate (APS) /N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) as redox initiating pair. Swelling experiments were performed in water, 0. 01 M and 0. 03 M aqueous urea solutions at 25 oC, gravimetrically. The hydrogels showed enormous swelling in aqueous urea/water medium and displayed swelling characteristics that were highly depended on the chemical composition of the hydrogels. FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of different repeating units in the semi IPNs. Some swelling and diffusion characteristics were calculated for different semi IPNs and hydrogels prepared under various formulations. For sorption of cationic dye, <b>Lauths</b> violet into the hydrogels was studied by batch sorption technique at 25 oC. Dye removal capacity, adsorption percentage and partition coefficient of the hydrogels was investigated. Swelling and dye sorption properties of AAm/AMPS hydrogels and AAm/AMPS/PEG semi IPNs were investigated as a function of chemical composition of the hydrogels...|$|R

40|$|Circular dichroism (CD) and {{magnetic}} circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of nitrogenase components (MoFe protein and Fe protein) from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) {{have been obtained}} in the near infrared—visible—near ultraviolet spectral region. Previously, visible CD {{was reported to be}} absent or barely detectable in nitrogenase proteins; MCD spectra have not been reported. The chiroptical spectra can be measured in solution at room temperature, an advantage relative to spectroscopic methods requiring cryogenic sample temperatures. Absorption spectra were also obtained. The CD and MCD are markedly more structured, and thus interpretively more useful, than the corresponding absorption spectra. The dithionite-reduced MoFe proteins (Av 1, Kp 1) have nearly identical CD and MCD, demonstrating identical numbers and types of metal centers in similar protein environments. The CD and MCD cannot be explained solely in terms of contributions from known 4 -Fe or 2 -Fe clusters; the near-infrared MCD is inconsistent with the presence of known 4 -Fe clusters. CD and MCD spectra of <b>Lauth's</b> violet-oxidized Kp 1 are also reported. The reduced Fe proteins (Av 2, Kp 2) have similar CD and MCD, again indicating significant conservation of chromophore environment. The spectra clearly demonstrate the presence of a reduced bacterial ferredoxin-like (C 3 -) 4 -Fe cluster. No obvious evidence of additional chromophores is observed. CD, MCD, and absorption spectra of Av 1 -oxidized Av 2 are reported. The absorption spectrum shows the expected shoulder near 390 nm. The CD and MCD are characteristic of a C 2 - 4 -Fe cluster; in particular, the diagnostic near-infrared MCD peak is observed at ≈ 8300 cm- 1. The CD of Av 2 oxidized in the presence and absence of MgATP are radically different, providing the first direct evidence for MgATP interaction with Fe protein in this oxidation state...|$|R
40|$|The Mo–Fe {{protein and}} the Fe protein which {{together}} constitute the nitrogenase of Klebsiella pneumoniae were prepared from bacteria grown in 57 Fe-enriched medium. The Mössbauer {{spectrum of the}} Mo–Fe protein, as isolated {{in the presence of}} Na 2 S 2 O 4, showed that the protein contained three iron species, called M 4, M 5 and M 6. The area of the spectrum associated with species M 4, with δ= 0. 65 mm/s and ΔE= 3. 05 mm/s at 4. 2 °K, corresponded to two iron atoms/molecule of protein and it is interpreted as being due to a high-spin ferrous, spin-coupled pair of iron atoms. The iron atoms of species M 4 may be involved in the quaternary structure of the protein. Species M 5, with δ= 0. 61 mm/s and ΔE= 0. 83 mm/s at 77 °K, corresponded to eight iron atoms/molecule of protein and is interpreted as being due to Fe 4 S 4 or Fe 2 S 2 low-spin ferrous iron clusters. Species M 6, with δ= 0. 37 mm/s and ΔE= 0. 71 mm/s at 77 °K, also corresponded to eight iron atoms/molecule of protein and, at 4. 2 °K, became a broad shallow absorption, characteristic of magnetic hyperfine interaction. Oxidation of the Mo–Fe protein with the redox dye <b>Lauth's</b> Violet did not affect the activity of the protein but changed species M 4, M 5 and M 6 into the species M 1 (δ= 0. 37 mm/s, ΔE= 0. 75 mm/s at 77 °K, broad magnetic component at 4. 2 °K) and M 2 (δ= 0. 35 mm/s, ΔE= 0. 9 mm/s at 4. 2 °K). In the presence of the Fe protein, Na 2 S 2 O 4, ATP and Mg 2 +, the M 6 component of the Mo–Fe protein was replaced by species M 7 with δ= 0. 46 mm/s, ΔE= 1. 04 mm/s at 4. 2 °K. The change in Mössbauer parameters associated with the M 6 → M 7 transformation was very similar to the change observed on reduction of the high-potential Fe protein from Chromatium vinosum. In contrast, Na 2 S 2 O 4 -reduced Fe protein contained only one type of iron cluster (F 4). Species F 4 had δ= 0. 50 mm/s, ΔE= 0. 9 mm/s at 195 °K, and at 4. 2 °K broadened in a manner characteristic of a magnetic hyperfine interaction, associated with half-integral spin, equally distributed over all four atoms of the Fe protein. The Mössbauer spectra of the Mo–Fe and the Fe protein under argon were unaffected by the reducible substrates N 2 and C 2 H 2 and the inhibitor CO in the presence of ATP, Mg 2 + and Na 2 S 2 O 4. A number of Mössbauer spectral species associated with inactivated Mo–Fe and Fe proteins are described and discussed...|$|R
