40|$|Ce texte resitue la Conciliation Travail-Famille (CTF) dans le cadre plus large de la « Qualité de l’emploi », ce qui concentre l’attention sur les aspects professionnels de la question. Il traite ensuite de façon transversale du rôle des trois {{instances}} supranationales que sont <b>le</b> <b>BIT</b> (Bureau international du travail), la Fondation de Dublin et la Commission Européenne dans le gouvernement de la CTF. Qu’entend-on, tout d’abord, par « qualité de l’emploi » (ou, selon la perspective du BIT « travail décent »)  ? Au sens le plus large, il s’agit d’un concept multidimensionnel touchant à la qualité du travail exercé et de son contenu, mais aussi aux caractéristiques de l’emploi et de la personne qui l’occupe, ainsi qu’à l’environnement des travailleurs et au fonctionnement du marché du travail dans son ensemble. Nous verrons bien la diversité des contenus, et montrerons que la CTF peut d’ailleurs relever aussi bien du niveau macro que du niveau méso. This paper situates {{the issue}} of Work-Family Reconciliation in the wider context of « quality of employment », which concentrates the attention on the professional aspects of the question. It then addresses in a transversal way {{the role of the}} three supranational organizations that are the ILO (International Labour Organisation), the Dublin Foundation and the European Commission in the governance of the issue. First of all the paper addresses {{the issue of}} what is meant by « quality of employment » or « decent work », as it is labelled by the ILO ? In the wider sense, it is a multidimensional concept which concerns quality of employment and its content, but also the characteristics of employment and the person who occupies the job, and finally the environment of workers and the functioning of the labour market in general. The paper highlights the diversity of contents and shows that Work-family reconciliation can relate to the macro as well as the meso level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} two implementations of BLAKE hash family algorithm {{that has}} been selected {{as one of the}} SHA- 3 competition finalist. The first implementation is a modification from the implementation of Beuchat et al. which significantly reduces the required ROM size up to 36 % from the original requirement with small trade-off in additional logic circuit. The second implementation is an extension from Half-G structure that was designed to be flexible for different kinds of application. The highly compact BLAKE- 256 design uses 356 <b>LE</b> and 9776 <b>bits</b> of memory when implemented in Cyclone III FPGA. Regular datapath design requires 369 slices and 1 memory block in Virtex 5 FPGA. Both designs are fully autonomous, which means that these designs do not require any additional memory or logic outside its system.

40|$|AbstractDuring aiming, an archer {{holds the}} {{stretched}} bow while {{a small piece}} of metal - the clicker - presses the arrow lateral against the bow. At the end of the aiming phase, the archer pulls the arrow back until the clicker slips over the arrowhead and causes a click, and then the archer shoots. To investigate the precision of the timing of this motor program, an acoustic measurement system has been developed. The system is composed of a modular microphone (AKG C 480 B comb-ULS/ 61), and an external FireWire Audio Interface (Focusrite Saffire <b>LE</b> 24 <b>Bit</b> / 96 kHz). From the audio signal, the time of the clicker's fall, the release of the shot and the hit of the target can be detected. Seven elite archers (two males, five female) performed 30 shots (ten ends of three arrows without any time limit) at 18 m indoors. Means and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from average speed and clicker time, i. e. the time between the click and the release of the shot. Forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was done to determine mean scores. CV of the clicker time accounted for 66 % of the variability in scoring. A “leave-one-out” cross validation procedure revealed consistent estimate of the model (all corrected R 2 were in a range of 0. 66 and 0. 75 with p< 0. 03). It has been shown that a highly precise timing in arrow release in terms of small CVs of clicker time is important for high mean scoring...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new method for watermarking of IP cores for FPGA architectures where the signature (watermark) is detected at the power supply pins of the FPGA. This is the first watermarking method where the signature is extracted in this way. We are able to sign IP cores at the netlist {{as well as the}} <b>bit.</b> <b>le</b> level, so a wide spectrum of cores can be protected. In principle, the proposed power watermarking method works for all kinds of FPGAs. For Xilinx FPGAs, we demonstrate in detail that we can integrate the watermarking algorithms and the signature into the functionality of the watermarked core. So {{it is very hard to}} remove the watermark without destroying the core. Furthermore, we {{introduce a}} detection algorithm which can decode the signature from a voltage trace with high reliability. Additionally, two enhanced robustness algorithms are introduced which improve the detection probability in case of considerable noise sources. Using these techniques, it is possible to decode the signature even if other cores operate on the same device at the same time...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{were conducted in}} a mock-up commercial cooking area to study extinguishing mechanisms and effectiveness of water mist against cooking oil fires. The impact of water mist characteristics, such as spray angle, droplet size, flow rate, discharge pressure and type of nozzle, {{on the effectiveness of}} water mist against cooking oil fires was investigated. A series of oil splash experiments were also conducted to determine if the oil was splashed by water mist. In addition, the change in oil composition during heating and fire suppression was determined using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) technique. The study showed that cooking oil fires were very difficult to extinguish, because they burned at high temperature and re-ignited easily due to changes in oil composition during heating and fire suppression. The water mist systems developed in the present work effectively extinguished cooking oil fires and prevented them from re-ignition. The spray angle, discharge pressure, and water flow rate were important factors to determine the effectiveness of water mist in extinguishing cooking oil fires.

40|$|Multi-antenna schemes {{have been}} shown to provide {{remarkable}} gains in terms of spectral efficiency and extensive research has been dedicated to studying those in detail, discovering new setups in which multi-input multi-output (MIMO) schemes can be used and making them practical. This thesis is concerned with certain aspects of two particular setups in which MIMO techniques may be implemented, which we summarize below. - Limited feedback in the MIMO broadcast channel: We consider the downlink of a single cell where the base station (BS) has multiple antennas. A particular issue when dealing with such a system is that of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) : this has been shown to play a cardinal role, particularly in the case when users are equipped with single antennas. Given the importance of acquiring that CSIT, and the fact that this acquisition comes at the cost of using resources on the uplink direction and introducing delays, a large body of literature has been concerned with limited feedback schemes for this setup. In this thesis, we contribute two ideas {{to try to make the}} most of the available feedback resource. - Coordination and Cooperation in multicell systems: The above model of a single cell corresponds roughly to current cellular designs where frequency planning is used to separate cells that use the same frequency resources so that inter-cell interference is limited. This is however not very efficient and MIMO techniques may be used to allow for increased performance at full reuse. Thus incorporating more antennas at a given BS gives it the possibility to mitigate the interference it causes at users in other cells. This is one of the topics we deal with in this thesis and propose a scheme which, while requiring local CSI only, is shown to perform quite well. MIMO techniques in a multicell environment can moreover extend to multicell processing (MCP), whereby several BSs pool their antennas to essentially act as a giant MIMO transmitter. % and jointly serve their users. This, however, has significant costs in terms of backhaul for data and CSI sharing, which threatens the scalability of MCP. We start investigating how to deal with limitations related to both these aspects. Cette thèse traite certains aspects liés à deux scenarios dans lesquels des techniques MIMO peuvent être implémentées : - Nous nous intéressons d'abord à la voie descendante d'une cellule isolée où une station de base (SB) dotée de plusieurs antennes sert des utilisateurs mono-antenne. Dans un tel système, la connaissance du canal au niveau de l'émetteur joue un rôle particulièrement important. Vus cette importance et le fait que l'acquisition de cette connaissance nécessite l'usage de ressources en voie ascendante, nous contribuons deux idées pour bénéficier au mieux de la ressource dédiée au feedback : la première consiste en une procédure de transmission en deux étapes, la deuxième est une stratégie décentralisée dans laquelle chaque utilisateur varie <b>le</b> nombre de <b>bits</b> utilisés pour quantifier le canal en maintenant un débit moyen. - Ensuite, des scenarios multicellulaires sont considérés où des techniques MIMO peuvent améliorer la performance quand la totalité du spectre est réutilisée dans chaque cellule. Ainsi l'incorporation de plusieurs antennes au niveau d'une SB permet d'atténuer l'interférence causée au niveau des cellules voisines. Une stratégie de précodage est proposée qui nécessite une connaissance locale du canal seulement qui dans de nombreux cas a une performance analogue à celles de stratégies centralisées ou itératives. Les techniques MIMO peuvent également être étendues au traitement conjoint des signaux (multicell processing). Nous commençons à examiner le traitement des limitations liées aux coûts en termes de backhaul pour le partage des données à envoyer et de l'information sur le canal...|$|R
