5|$|After Sesame Streets initial success, the CTW {{began to}} think about its {{survival}} beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO during 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its work which included non-television activities, and Gary Knell became CEO. H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell during 2011. During 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.|$|E
25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a {{surveyor}} measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|E
500|$|After Sesame Streets initial success, its {{producers}} {{began to}} think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered [...] "seed" [...] money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements</b> with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{creating}} Sesame Street, its producers developed {{what came}} to be called the [...] "CTW model" [...] (after the production company's previous name), a system of television show planning, production, and evaluation based on collaborations between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> international sales, and other media. By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or [...] "co-productions", of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries. In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street, and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time, a public {{broadcasting}} series {{had the potential}} to earn a great deal of money. [...] Immediately after its premiere, Sesame Street gained attention from marketers, so the Workshop explored sources such as <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a [...] "multiple media institution". Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment, which {{had the potential to}} fund the organization and future productions and projects. Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of Sesame Street. As Davis reported, [...] "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" [...] in their marketing and licensing efforts. During the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|Clément is {{reported}} to have begun manufacture of Clément Tyres in 1878 to fit to the early cycles, but the French identity was lost with the overwhelming success of his Dunlop pneumatics. After World War I, Clément Pneumatics was established in Italy and was a leading supplier of Clément Pneumatici bicycle tyres throughout much of the 20th century. A leading international manufacturer during the 1950s,1960s and 1970s, it was associated with racing cyclists such as Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, and Ole Ritter. It was purchased by Pirelli in the 1980s and manufacturing was moved to Thailand until 1995 when Pirelli vacated the bicycle tyre market. [...] Various <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements</b> were of little consequence until, in 2010 the name was licensed to Donnelly Sports and the American, Don Kellogg, who recommenced manufacture in Thailand.|$|E
2500|$|In the Anglo-American {{model of}} care, the {{physician}} remains {{the leader of}} the care team, but paramedics function much more independently than in the Franco-German model. [...] This has not always been the case. [...] In the earliest days of paramedicine paramedics were required to contact a physician for formal orders for every single intervention that they performed. [...] Indeed, it was argued in some systems that this was the only safe approach to providing care in this fashion. There were early examples of 'paramedics' who operated blindly, providing medications from numbered or colour-coded syringes as they were directed by the physician, with no real understanding of the interventions that they were performing. [...] Control was absolute and immediate; there were examples of paramedics being trained, but not legally permitted to perform their skills, or in other cases, the performance of skills could only occur with a physician or nurse present, much like the existing Franco-German model. [...] This was absolutely necessary in the earliest stages of paramedicine as, in the absence of formal <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements</b> for paramedics, they often functioned {{as an extension of the}} physician's medical license. [...] This type of arrangement persists to this day in some locations, such as the Canadian province of Ontario. [...] As the training, knowledge and skill level of paramedics grew, as they developed licensing and certification processes, and as physicians became more comfortable in working with this new profession, greater degrees of independent practice were permitted. [...] This would ultimately evolve into a system in which most paramedics function almost purely on complex written protocols or s committed to memory, often numerous pages in length, and contacting a physician only when standing orders have been exhausted.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, college-level {{sports is}} big business, valued at $16 billion, {{according}} to two estimates. The UNC basketball program earned a profit of $17 million in 2012. Collegiate sports, as a business, exists within a non-business framework of tax-exempt non-profit universities which are focused on research and education; in a sense, big-money athletics [...] "coexists uneasily" [...] with universities, according to one view. The success of college teams on playfields has a powerful impact on collegiate prestige, such that a college's winning team can stoke alumni donations as well as encourage higher levels of applicants. Further, collegiate sports, particularly at state flagship universities such as UNC, is a deep part {{of the lives of}} millions of alumni, fans, and students, practically [...] "sacrosanct", triggering deep-seated emotions, particularly when their school's teams compete on the national level. Basketball and football competitions between large public universities attract huge audiences and bring millions of dollars in revenue through advertising, ticket sales, brand merchandising, <b>licensing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and video game contracts. For example, in 2012, UNC sports revenues were $82.4 million, less expenses of $81.9 million, but that the university ranked 25th behind many colleges with more sports revenue. While sports coaches at these colleges can earn million-dollar salaries, players are not paid salaries as such, but rather are given scholarships and tuition breaks and other perks instead. There is an implicit bargain in effect: in exchange for a player's sacrifice on the gridiron or basketball court, a player will receive an academically-competent college education, often subsidized with scholarships, that will help the athlete succeed after college. Yet playing at top levels is demanding physically, leading to questions whether it is sensible to expect hard-working athletes to try to keep up with academics.|$|E
