50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of lip balm is to provide an {{occlusive}} layer on the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> to seal moisture in lips and protect them from external exposure. Dry air, cold temperatures, and wind all have a drying effect on skin by drawing moisture away from the body. Lips are particularly vulnerable because the skin is so thin, and thus they are often the first to present signs of dryness. Occlusive materials like waxes and petroleum jelly prevent moisture loss and maintain lip comfort while flavorants, colorants, sunscreens, and various medicaments can provide additional, specific benefits.|$|E
5000|$|Lip piercings can {{be placed}} {{anywhere}} around the mouth, but {{the surface of the}} lip is not typically pierced itself, except for horizontal lip piercings and canine bites. Piercings in specific positions have certain names. Monroe piercings, for example, are labret studs worn on the upper lip where Marilyn Monroe had her famous beauty mark. Medusa piercings go {{through the center of the}} upper lip (the philtrum), perpendicular to the tissue. Labret piercings are pierced with a labret stud and can pierced in the center or off-center. A variation of this is the lowbret, a lower labret. Vertical labret piercings go through the center of the bottom lip, parallel to the tissue. The variation is called the vertical lowbret, which starts inside the mouth between the lower lip and the teeth and travels straight down, exiting on the lower edge of the jawline. Horizontal lip piercings are very rare, and include a horizontal bar on the lower lip that goes through the <b>lip</b> <b>surface.</b> Another variation of the labret is known as the dahlia piercing. The piercings, placed at or very near the corners of the mouth, are named in reference to the murder of Black Dahlia, in which the victim's mouth was cut along the same horizontal line along which these piercings are placed.

To realize the role of dietary fatty acids in human health and diseases, it would be eager to develop convenient and suitable method to monitor fatty acid metabolism in human. Results We have developed the measurement system in situ for human <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> lipids using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) – attenuated total reflection (ATR) detection system with special adaptor to monitor metabolic changes of lipids in human body. As human <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> lipids may not be much affected by skin sebum constituents and may be affected directly by the lipid constituents of diet, we could detect changes of FTIR-ATR spectra, especially at 3005 ~ 3015 cm - 1, of <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> polyunsaturated fatty acids in a duration time-dependent manner after intake of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) -containing triglyceride diet. The ingested DHA appeared on the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> and was detected by FTIR-ATR directly and non-invasively. It {{was found that the}} metabolic rates of DHA for male volunteer subjects with age 60 s were much lower than those with age 20 s. Lipid hydroperoxides were found in lip lipids which were extracted from the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> using a mixture of ethanol/ethylpropionate/ iso -octane solvents, and were the highest in the content just before noon. The changes of lipid hydroperoxides were detected also in situ with FTIR-ATR at 968 cm - 1.

We attempted to predict non-invasively blood hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) levels by FTIR to enable evaluation and screening for diabetes. Twenty eight patients from age 20 s to 80 s, 14 males and 14 females, with and without diabetes, were examined in hospital as a pilot study, and their biochemical data were analyzed with infrared (IR) spectral data of the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> by FTIR spectroscopy. Some IR peaks of <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> had significant correlations with blood glucose and HbA 1 c levels. Among several peaks in the spectra of lip, peaks at around 1300 – 1400 cm− 1 discriminated groups with higher or lower HbA 1 c levels, suggesting the observation of <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> advanced glycation end-products with carboxymethyl group. The application of partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis to the correlation between HbA 1 c levels and lip FTIR spectra resulted in highly significant prediction of HbA 1 c values for the subjects.

40|$|Aftershock hypocenters and focal {{mechanism}} {{solutions for}} the Coyote Lake, California, earthquake reveal a geometrically complex fault structure, consisting of multiples <b>lip</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The faulting surface principally consists of two right stepping en echelon, northwest trending, partially overlapping, nearly vertical sheets and is similar in geometry to a slip surface inferred for the 1966 Parkfield, California, earthquake. The overlap occurs near a prominent bend in the surface trace of the Calaveras fault at San Felipe Lake. Slip during the main rupture, as inferred from the distribution of early aftershocks, {{appears to have been}} confined to a 14 -km portion of the northeastern sheet between 4 - and 10 -km depth. Focal mechanisms and the hypocentral distribution of aftershocks sugges that the main rupture surface itself is geometrically complex, with left stepping imbricate structure. Seismic shear displacement on the southwestern slip surface commenced some 5 hours after the mainshock. Aftershocks in this zone define a single vertical plane 8 km long between 3 - and 7 -km depth. Within the overlap zone between the two main slip surfaces, the average strike of aftershock nodal planes is significantly rotated clockwise relative to the strike of the fault zone, in close agreement with the stress perturbations predicted by crack interaction models. Aftershock activity in the overlap zone is not associated with a simple dislocation surface. Space and time clustering within the entire aftershock set suggest an alternation of seismic displacement between the component parts of the fault zone. This alternation is consistent with local stress perturbations predicted by crack interaction models. We conclude that the fault structure is geometrically complex and that the displacements that occur on its component surfaces during the aftershock process dynamically interact by generating perturbations in the local stress field which, in turn, control the displacements...|$|R

Introduction: To date, there are few in vivo investigations in humans on the exact positioning of injectable hyaluronic acid fillers, and severe complications such as hematoma and thromboembolism are rarely addressed. Materials and methods: There were nine female patients investigated in this pilot study. All of them were periorally injected with hyaluronic acid. The exact product, amount, and locations, {{as well as the}} injection techniques, were recorded and compared. Before, immediately after, and 18 days after injection, photo documentation as well as high-resolution ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography of the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> were performed. Results: Minor bruising occurred, which resolved within 7 to 9 days. On day 18, no more hemorrhage could be detected. Injected material distributed well in the tissue, and no embolism or thrombosis occurred. However, the injected material came close (up to 1 mm) to important structures such as blood vessels. Lip wrinkles improved, and the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> was smoother and more even. Conclusion: Hyaluronic acid injections can improve aesthetics and reduce fine wrinkles of the lips. In the patients investigated in this study, compression of structures such as vessels and nerve fibers did not occur, nor did any severe complications result from injection. However, one must be aware of serious complications (eg, hematoma, thromboembolism) and the important anatomic structures (eg, orbicularis oris muscle, vessels, and nerves), and injecting physicians should always have hyaluronidase as a rescue medication at hand. Summary: Hyaluronic acid is a suitable tool for lip augmentation and reduction of fine lines; however, one must be aware of anatomic structures when injecting filler material into the lips and perioral area, and be familiar with the injection techniques.

40|$|An elastohydrodynamic {{analysis}} of a rotary lip seal is performed numerically, incorporating both the fluid mechanics of the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip, by solving the Reynolds equation with flow factors. Asperities on the <b>lip</b> <b>surface</b> dominate {{the behavior of the}} flow field in the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip. Since previous analyses treated those asperities deterministically, they required very large computation times. The present approach is much less computationally intensive because the asperities are treated statistically. Since cavitation and asperity orientation play important roles, these are taken into account in the computation of the flow factors. An asperity distortion analysis is introduced to obtain a more realistic model of the complex variations in the asperity distribution {{on the surface of the}} seal. Results of the analysis show how the operating parameters of the seal and the characteristics of the asperities affect such seal characteristics as the thickness of the lubricating film, reverse pumping rate, power dissipation and load carrying capacity.
