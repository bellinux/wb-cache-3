40|$|Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) {{is common}} fuel used for domestics, {{industrial}} and commercial appliances in Malaysia. Homes in Malaysia get LPG cylinders in various sizes offered by supplier,but {{most of them}} using 14 kg cylinder. Generally, LPG composed of volatile low boiling point gases – ethane, propane,propene,iso-butane,n-butane,but- 1 -ene,iso-butene, trans- 2 -butene,cis- 2 -butene,and also iso-pentane and n-pentane due to the availability of higher boiling point components. When LPG is used,the low boiling point components will evaporate and the high boiling point components will stay in the cylinder. The research aimes to design an exploratory instrumentation for liquid LPG sampling under pressure,to explore the composition of liquid LPG in the <b>LPG</b> <b>cylinder</b> used in Malaysia and conclude whether some of the product might stay in the cylinder as liquid component after the volatiles are used.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Mobile Telecommunication and Innovation at (MSc. MTI) at Strathmore UniversityTracing and verification of the authenticity of filled Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders has been marked with numerous challenges especially in the Sub-Saharan region. With an increase in LPG consumption, numerous sales points have sprouted in residential estates which even sell unbranded cylinders. Some traders involved in the illegal refilling and branding of cylinders use cylinders that {{do not meet the}} quality standards of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, thus compromising consumers’ safety. Consequently, unlicensed gas operators are gaining an unfair advantage as they do not incur the cost of purchasing cylinders. Consumers end up paying the same for genuine and illegal products in spite of the non-compliance on safety checks, cylinder re-validation, gas specifications, quantity and value added tax remittance. This research used document survey and an online questionnaire that was distributed to 96 LPG consumers to provide a detailed study of the characteristics of the authenticity of a filled <b>LPG</b> <b>cylinder,</b> methods and technology currently used to trace and verify the authenticity of filled <b>LPG</b> <b>cylinder</b> and how a mobile application for tracing and verification of the authenticity of filled <b>LPG</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be designed, developed, tested and validated. The data collected from the 96 respondents was analysed using Google analytics tools and the results used to obtain the system requirements and design of an Android mobile application for tracing and verifying the authenticity of filled Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinders. Agile software development methodology was used which allows faster iteration and more frequent user feedback. The Android application was integrated with an analytical back-end for LPG manufacturers, distributors and retailers that present a summary of LPG supplies made. Testing and validation was done on the final prototype by the potential users and developer of the application. Users stand to benefit by using the mobile application to ensure their safety by verifying the authenticity of gas cylinders anytime and from anywhere...|$|E

Background The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (<b>LPG)</b> <b>cylinder</b> market consist of a group of consumers with similar yet differentiated needs, namely commercial customers (small industries, restaurants, wholesalers and nature reserves), low-income customers (such as the rural and township households with a monthly income ofR 748 - R 2288) and high-income customers (such as the urban households with a monthly income above R 9743). LPG is mainly used for cooking, lighting, heating, leisure and as a preferred form of energy in the commercial segment.

40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gases (LPG) are substances such as propane and butane, {{which are}} transported {{and stored in}} the liquid phase in tanks under sufficiently high pressure. It is generated as a by-product either {{of oil and gas}} production or refining. The composition components of LPG are much simpler than that of gasoline. LPG is thought to be a cleaner fuel because it is has less impact on air quality. The objective of this thesis is to obtain detailed understanding of <b>LPG</b> <b>cylinder</b> system behavior during the continuous exhaustion or natural evaporation process via modification of the existing cylinder design. Experiments have been conducted to predict the parameters affecting the evaporation process such as surrounding temperature, pressure, composition and flowrate of LPG in cylinder based on the rig set up. The investigation of these parameters during discharging process is the initial step in a usage management of LPG, which is an essential part to evaluate the left over problem. In a parallel effort, a computer model has been developed based on the unsteady state of heat and mass transfer concepts using MATCAB 2000...|$|E
