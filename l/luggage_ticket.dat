50|$|Airports in EU {{countries}} such as Finland, Ireland or the United Kingdom, also have a blue channel. As the EU is a customs union, travellers between EU countries {{do not have to}} pay customs duties. Value-added tax and excise duties may be applicable if the goods are subsequently sold, but these are collected when the goods are sold, not at the border. Passengers arriving from other EU countries go through the blue channel, where they may still be subject to checks for prohibited or restricted goods. <b>Luggage</b> <b>tickets</b> for checked <b>luggage</b> travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified. In most EU member states, travellers coming from other EU countries can simply use the green lane.|$|R

There were no <b>luggage</b> <b>tickets,</b> but when the luggage weighed more than 28 pounds up to 56 pounds, a fee was assessed for 4 chakras. Passengers with luggage that weighed more than 56 pounds were assessed a fee of 6 chakras up to 112 pounds and above.

50|$|To {{replace the}} {{destroyed}} interlocking {{panel in the}} station building, the second signal box for guarding points was converted to house an interlocking panel. The station building {{was replaced by a}} wooden shed. Planning for a new station began in 1952. The planned building was similar to the station building in Bad Reichenhall. The following facilities were planned: an operations room, a <b>luggage</b> hall, a <b>ticket</b> office, a lobby, lavatories, a station restaurant and upstairs apartments for railway employees. The side of the building next to the station forecourt was glazed and connected by stairs to the forecourt. The cost of the building was 740,000 Deutsche Mark, with DM 160,000 provided by Deutsche Bundesbahn and DM 580,000 provided by the state of Bavaria. The electrification of the Traunstei-Ruhpolding line was completed on 3 November 1955. The Ruhpolding locomotive depot was moved to Traunstein. A new track plan interlocking of class SpDrS60 was put into operation on 14 July 1964. The signal box was built {{to the west of the}} station building. On 26 September 1976, Traunstein, became a node for freight operations, but this was discontinued on 1 June 1983. The roundhouse was demolished in the 1980s. Since 1986, signalling at Übersee station has been remotely controlled by the dispatcher in Traunstein. Local freight operations in Traunstein were abandoned on 29 October 1997. The station building was renovated for 800,000 DM in 1997. A travel centre, a Sparda-Bank, a book shop and a cafe were established in the station.|$|R
