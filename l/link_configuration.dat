40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of applications in wireless networks is partly {{dependent upon the}} <b>link</b> <b>configuration.</b> Link characteristics varies with frame retransmission persistency, link frame retransmission delay, adaptive modulation strategies, coding, and more. The <b>link</b> <b>configuration</b> and channel conditions can lead to packet loss, delay and delay variations, which impact different applications in different ways. A bulk transfer application may tolerate delays to a large extent, while packet loss is undesirable. On the other hand, real-time interactive applications are sensitive to delay and delay variations, but may tolerate packet loss to a certain extent. This paper contributes {{a study of the}} effect of link frame retransmission persistency and delay on packet loss and latency for real-time interactive applications. The results indicate that a reliable retransmission mechanism with fast link retransmissions in the range of 2 - 8 ms is sufficient to provide an upper delay bound of 50 ms over the wireless link, which is well within the delay budget of voice over IP applications.

40|$|Abstract – This {{paper has}} two main contributions. First the {{extremely}} high latency of the GSM link is revealed which through measurements {{is determined to}} have a magnitude usually only known from satellite links. This greatly impacts the <b>link</b> <b>configuration</b> time of packet framing protocols for serial links like the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). The key idea of the proposed solution- Quickstart-PPP- is to break the strict sequential order of the different signalling phases while ensuring that protocol semantics are not violated and interoperability with existing PPP implementations is preserved. As a result the <b>link</b> <b>configuration</b> delay can be completely eliminated. The second contribution uncovers a fundamental problem {{which is that the}} GSM circuitswitched data service is not capable of satisfying different reliability requirements simultaneously. More precisely {{it is not possible to}} use applications requiring the GSM link to operate in reliable mode together with loss-tolerant but delay-sensitive applications at the same time. The developed solution- Link Sniffer- suggests a mechanism that can be added to the implementation of GSM’s reliable link layer protocol which allows to “sniff ” on packet headers to determine the reliability mode to be used. The key advantage of this solution is that the link layer protocol itself does not have to be changed. I...|$|E
