5000|$|Dude! Where's My Luggage? (おーい, オレの荷物どこだよ!?) - Players {{run on a}} {{conveyor}} belt carrying luggage, and throw luggage with a blue tag into a <b>luggage</b> <b>bin</b> next to the belt. As an advantage for the team that has {{the least amount of}} players, one member of the other team would wear a carrot suit and boxing gloves to level the playing field. The team with the most points in three minutes is the winner.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{implementation of}} the low floor design exists in Australia, where Custom Coaches makes a [...] "Hybrid" [...] variant of its CB60 bodywork. These buses combine a smaller low floor area with a small underfloor bin for some luggage. Whilst these buses do not provide a full amount of luggage space, {{they can be used}} to house more luggage than what can be held inside the bus itself. Another drawback is the arrangement means the section of the bus that is at curb height is very short-consisting of enough space to house the wheelchair area and then rising up, to accommodate the <b>luggage</b> <b>bin.</b> These buses also lack the ability to have a center door.|$|E
50|$|Historically {{and through}} the present, almost all buses in the Golden Gate Transit fleet are suburban-style coaches fitted with high-back seats, {{overhead}} <b>luggage</b> <b>bins,</b> and reading lights.|$|R
50|$|Seven trains {{comprise}} the fleet of Union Pearson Express (UP Express), grouped into 4 three-car and 3 two-car train sets (for {{a total of}} 18 cars). Union Pearson Express units feature enclosed overhead <b>luggage</b> <b>bins</b> as required by Transport Canada, and an enhanced enclosed luggage tower.|$|R

5000|$|The UP Express DMUs {{are based}} on the design created for the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit system in California. Powered by a diesel {{hydraulic}} drive with a six-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking, the DMUs are {{believed to be the first}} trains in the world that comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 emission standards, which will reduce emissions up to 90%. Braking energy is converted into electricity by the auxiliary power generator, and helps to provide onboard lighting and heating. [...] They also comply with FRA Tier 1 crash energy management features. Modifications for UP Express use include enclosed overhead <b>luggage</b> <b>bins</b> that comply with Transport Canada rules and an enhanced enclosed luggage tower.|$|R

50|$|This is the {{preferred}} method of constructing an all-aluminum fuselage. First, a series of frames {{in the shape of}} the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture. These frames are then joined with lightweight longitudinal elements called stringers. These are in turn covered with a skin of sheet aluminum, attached by riveting or by bonding with special adhesives. The fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell, which is then fitted out with wiring, controls, and interior equipment such as seats and <b>luggage</b> <b>bins.</b> Most modern large aircraft are built using this technique, but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage. As the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture, this form is suitable for series production, where a large number of identical aircraft are to be produced. Early examples of this type include the Douglas Aircraft DC-2 and DC-3 civil aircraft and the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Most metal light aircraft are constructed using this process.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{ridership}} on the San Joaquin led Caltrans {{to purchase}} 14 Comet IB rail cars from New Jersey Transit in 2008 for $75,000 per car. The former commuter cars refurbished and reconfigured by Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops {{to serve as}} intercity coaches {{at a cost of}} approximately $20 million. The refurbished cars have reclining inter-city seats with tray tables (4 per row), AmtrakConnect WiFi, two power outlets at each seat pair, <b>luggage</b> racks, trash/recycling <b>bins,</b> a restroom, and 6 workstation tables {{in the center of the}} car.|$|R
