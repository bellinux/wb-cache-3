40|$|It {{would not}} be wrong to say {{that for the most}} part {{literature}} confronts critically and reuses what has gone before. This is particularly true of the Middle Ages when to be original was to rework and give new meaning to the auctoritates of the past: “gloser la letre et de lur sen <b>le</b> <b>surplus</b> metre”, as Marie de France puts it in the Prologue to her Lais. Boccaccio, who in many ways is a profoundly medieval author, is no exception, and his codification of the novella is essentially the result of a rewriting of previous works, many of which were French, a culture he had learned to appreciate during his stay in Angevin Naples in 1327 - 1340 / 41. By comparing a few of the tales in the Decameron to possible Old French analogues, this chapter will set out to show that Boccaccio’s rewriting of the French tradition frequently relies heavily on comic strategies involving language and parody. The result is both a new genre, the novella, and a new style, that of a comedìa, in the sense that Dante, perhaps Boccaccio’s main source of inspiration, had understood it...|$|E
40|$|<b>Le</b> <b>surplus</b> de butadiène {{au niveau}} mondial {{contraint}} les pétrochimistes à recycler la coupe C 4 au vapocraqueur. De plus en plus, le butadiène est hydrogéné avant de recraquer toute la coupe. Une fois hydrogénée, cette coupe peut être beaucoup mieux valorisée, soit en MTBE avec isomérisation des n-butènes (procédé ISO- 4), soit en propylène et MTBE en utilisant le procédé META- 4. L'étude technico-économique montre que cette dernière voie offre la meilleure rentabilité (TRI = 21, 5 %). Si le vapocraqueur est intégré à une raffinerie, les butènes peuvent également être transformés en alkylats ou en MTBE, pour répondre à une demande en octane ou en oxygénés pour les carburants. Ces diverses voies de valorisation sont plus intéressantes que la production de MTBE à partir des butanes via la déshydrogénation de l'isobutane ou que la production du propylène par déshydrogénation du propane. Une étude de sensibilité aux différents prix des produits envisagés permet d'établir des courbes d'isorentabilités, délimitant des zones de prix favorables à l'un ou l'autre des produits, pris deux à deux. The {{evolution of the}} outlets for C 4 cuts from steam cracking shows quite contradictory results. On one hand, European and Asian petrochemists are more constrained to recycle this type of effluent, which contains butadiene and isobutene, to the steam cracker. Likewise, the demand for isobutene for MTBE production is such {{that it has to}} be produced by the dehydrogenation of isobutane. This situation is effectively caused by the surplus of butadiene, a by-product of ethylene, and for which the demand is not increasing as fast as the demand for ethylene. To improve cracking performances during the recycling of the C 4 Cut, butadiene is more and more selectively hydrogenated. Under these conditions, rather than cracking it, the new processes could make it possible to better upgrade it. Indeed, after selective hydrogenation, most of the cut can be transformed into MTBE by implementing the new n-butene isomerization process. Another upgrading scheme consits in transforming isobutene into MTBE and n-butenes into propylene by metathesis with ethylene. These new route may find competition in the transformation of butenes into alkylates, for automotive gasoline, with or without MTBE production. After a brief review of the different markets for the products involved, a technico-economic study serves to classify the different upgrading routes of the C 4 cut from steam cracking, by comparing both the minimum profitable selling prices for a discounting rate of 12 % and the discounted cash-flow rate of return for fixed selling prices. Calculations are performed within a context in which the C 4 cut is devalorized in relation to naphtha with a price of $ 152 /t. When butadiene no longer finds any outlets, and when its price is at a very low level such as $ 270 /t, its extraction is hardly profitable, and propylene production by methatesis proves to be more advantageous. However, if the steam cracker is integrated in a refinery, butenes may also be advantageously transformed into alkylates or MTBE, more especially to meet a demand for octane or oxygenated products for fuels. These different routes for upgrading MTBE are more advantageous than MTBE production from butanes, requiring heavy investments for the separation of butanes, the isomerization of n-butane and the dehydrogenation of isobutane. Likewise, the transformation of butenes into propylene is more profitable than obtaining propylene by the dehydrogenation of proprane. A sensitivity study, for the price of butadiene and also for the price of other products, enables isoprofitability curves to be plotted, which delimite price zones favorable to one or the other of the products considered, taken two by two...|$|E
40|$|Two parties {{bargaining}} over a pie, {{the size}} of which is determined by their previous investment decisions. Investment costs are heterogeneous. The bargaining rule is sensitive to investment behavior. Two games are studied which di¤er for the considered sociopolitical structure: communal property in one case and private property in the other. We hereby show that in both games when a unique stochastically stable outcome exists a norm of investment and a norm of surplus division must coevolve. While the investment norm always supports the e ¢ cient investment pro 8 ̆ 5 <b>le,</b> the <b>surplus</b> division norm may di¤er among these games depending on {{the size of}} investment cost gap. Under private property only the egalitarian surplus division evolves. Under communal property instead two di¤erent surplus division norms may evolve: the egalitarian one and an inegali-tarian norm. We show that no cap to payo¤s inequality emerges under private property while an inequality payo ¤ cap endogenously evolves un-der communal property. The games have been proposed to explain the social norms used in modern hunter-gatherer societies.

40|$|The soil {{purification}} capacity for treating pig slurry was evaluated {{over five years}} using a hydrologically isolated field treatment plant, the so-called "Solepur" process. This involves three operations : (1) overdosing the managed field with surplus slurry, (2) collecting and treating the nitrate rich leachate, (3) irrigating the final treated water over other fields. The facility consists of (1) a managed field (3280 m 2) which allows the total recovery of all the leachate water wich percolates through growing ryegrass, Lolium perenne, to which the pig slurry is apllied, (2) a storage-pump-reactor system for denitrification and (3) a non managed field for completing treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate over a five year monitoring period, the feasibility and performances of such a process, and to determine the optimum operationg conditions. From 1991 to 1995, 4931 m 3 /ha of raw pig slurry was applied to the managed field wich represents a nominal load of 983 m 3 ha - 1 yr - 1. This process decreased the COD of pig slurry by 99. 9 % and removed 99. 9 % of phosphorus and appoximately 90 % of nitrogen. / La capacité de purification par le sol du lisier de porc a été évaluée à l'aide d'une parcelle isolée hydrologiquement.

40|$|A {{resurgence}} of perceived opportunities by international investors {{has resulted in}} a new policy debate regarding the regulation of capital flows into certain South American countries. The integrationist camp defends totally open markets {{on the grounds that they}} result in a more efficient financial sector, greater asset diversification, and other benefits, while those in the isolationist camp support regulating capital inflows on the grounds that they generate macroeconomic instability and reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy. Noting that there are both costs and benefits associated with external capital flows, Guillermo Le Fort V., international director of the Central Bank of Chile, and Carlos Budnevich L., manager of financial analysis for the Central Bank of Chile, argue against both extremes, opting instead for a policy falling somewhere between the two. An intermediate policy of gradual and limited financial integration has been adopted in Chile and Colombia, two countries experiencing capital account <b>surpluses.</b> <b>Le</b> Fort and Budnevich examine the macroeconomic and financial results during the 1990 s of the countries' policies regarding external capital accounts. In the early 1980 s the Chilean financial system was wracked by insolvency that was deepened by recession. By 1983 volatile international capital inflows, resulting from the removal of restrictions to such flows, had precipated a widespread crisis. Having weathered this experience, Chile's financial institutions are cautious and concerned about maintaining moderate current account deficits. Policies to accomplish this goal include a targeted range for the medium-term current account deficit, foreign exchange market and capital account regulations, and a limit to the degree of integration of external and domestic markets. The authors note, however, that the reserve requirement cannot stem currency appreciation, which has averaged about 4 percent per year. They also conclude that capital account regulations have not impaired the financial system. "In fact, despite the regulations, the financial system and the capital markets have achieved very significant development in Chile over the past few years. "...|$|R
