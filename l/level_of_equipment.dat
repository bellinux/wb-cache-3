The cars came with [...] and automatic transmission, power steering, power disk brakes, [...] "twin-grip" [...] rear axle, and other items that were optional on the U.S. models. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black and featured unique seats, door panels, and a fiberglass RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. The Australian AMXs came with a large high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and were promoted as [...] "super" [...] personal luxury cars.|$|E
2500|$|The G20 was a badge-engineered {{version of}} the Nissan Primera, but because Infiniti was pitched as a premium brand, it {{featured}} a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> compared to its European and Japanese relatives. The only engine available was the 2.0litre SR20DE Inline 4-cylinder; in Europe this was the top-of-the-line engine for the Primera lineup. 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions were both available, with the 5-speed being praised as [...] "one {{of the best in}} the business." [...] Power windows, power locks, power mirrors, air conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, alloy wheels, a Bose stereo, a theft-deterrent system, cruise control, floor mats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob were all standard. Heated mirrors, leather seats and a power moonroof were common options, and were later offered in a package that included power seats and keyless entry. Later models also featured dual front airbags. The standard trim was called Luxury. Two major trim package upgrades were offered: Touring, badged G20t, available from model years 1994 to 1996 and 1999 to 2001, and Sport (with no badge modification) which was offered during model year 2002. These packages featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission, sportier, more highly bolstered front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, all-black leather interior, fog lamps, and a spoiler on the rear decklid. The details of these trims varied from year to year.|$|E

2500|$|Since its {{redesign}} in 1970, the hardtop {{body style}} started {{to drop in}} sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM {{did not want to}} drop it leaving it without a mid-sized two-door. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus for 1972, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car. This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name [...] "Rambler" [...] removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment (also shared with the Rebel Machine), individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright trim for pedals, heater, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> the public saw it as the previous model. The only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations. The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Matador Machine sold in the U.S. and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador/Rebel model produced in Mexico.|$|E
