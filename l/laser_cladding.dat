5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, <b>laser</b> <b>cladding,</b> and x-ray welding.|$|E

40|$|The wear {{behaviour}} of 4 different High Speed Steel (HSS) thick coatings (one {{cast material}} and 3 <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> deposits with varying Mo, V and W contents) was investigated at 2 different test temperatures, i. e. {{at room temperature}} and at 300 °C. For all four materials under both test conditions, oxidative wear was identified as the main wear mechanism. The 3 <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> deposits exhibit a higher wear resistance compared to the conventional cast reference material, and this effect was mainly attributed to their strongly refined microstructures.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} the microstructure dependency of erosion behaviour of <b>laser</b> <b>clad,</b> detonation sprayed and atmospheric plasma sprayed chromium carbide based coatings. The final chromium carbide content {{in all the}} coatings was a strong function of rapid solidification rate associated with the processes. In the <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> coating majority of the chromium carbides re-solidified while in the thermally sprayed coatings chromium carbide re-solidification was hindered to a large extent. Hence, the final chromium carbide content in the thermally sprayed coating decreased with increased extent of particle melting during spraying. Decarburisation and oxidation during thermal spraying lead {{to the formation of}} chromium carbides with lower carbon content and chromium oxide(s). <b>Laser</b> <b>clad</b> and detonation sprayed coatings, with higher chromium carbide content, showed lower erosion rates and exhibited fewer brittle erosion events. Embrittlement due to excessive dissolution of chromium carbides into the matrix and poor splat bonding were found to be the reasons for higher erosion rate of the plasma sprayed coating. Scanning electron microscopy and quantification of single erodent impact events clearly established ductile material removal in the <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> and detonation sprayed coating and brittle material removal in the plasma sprayed coating as the dominant mechanism(s).

SEM/EDX and PXRD analyses with Rietveld refinement were used for assessment of the attack and for analysis of the scales. The bare samples suffered from scale spallation and the scale was mostly composed of Cr 2 O 3, CoCr 2 O 4 and CoO, although due to dilution haematite (Fe 2 O 3) was detected in the scale formed on the <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> sample. A small amount of hydrated HCl was detected in bare samples. While the corrosion of the bare surfaces was limited to comparatively shallow depths and manifested by g and M 7 C 3 carbide formation, the presence of KCl on the surface led to severe Cr depletion from the HVOF coating (to 1 wt%). Both inward and outward diffusion of elements occurred in the HVOF coating resulting in Kirdendall voids at the coating–steel interface.

40|$|The {{oxidative}} wear behaviour of {{four different}} High Speed Steel (HSS) thick coatings (one cast material and three <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> deposits with varying Mo, V and W contents) was investigated using a pin-on-disc tribometer at two different sliding speeds of 10 cm/s and 50 cm/s. Microstructural characterisation (before {{and after the}} wear tests) {{was carried out by}} SEM and wear debris was analysed by XRD. For all four materials, the oxide layer was formed of hard and brittle haematite-type α-Fe 2 O 3, prone to break and release debris that acted as a third body, thus increasing sample wear. The <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> HSS materials exhibited a higher wear resistance than their conventional cast counterpart, thanks to their finer microstructures. In particular, the coarser MC and M 2 C carbides present in the cast material were sensitive to cracking during the wear tests, releasing debris that contributed to increased third body abrasion together with oxide fragments. A detailed comparison of the wear behaviour of the three <b>laser</b> <b>clad</b> deposits, in correlation with their different microstructures, further demonstrated that harder V-rich MC carbides offered better wear resistance compared to the softer W-rich M 2 C carbides. The morphology of the carbides also played a role in determining the wear resistance at the higher sliding speed of 50 cm/s. Clover-shaped primary MC carbides resisted wear better than angular ones due to their better geometric anchoring. Similarly, the geometric anchoring of eutectic M 2 C carbides, forming a quasi-continuous network at the grain boundaries of the matrix, proved beneficial at higher sliding speed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In the tests carried out, wear was not always reduced with the cladding.
