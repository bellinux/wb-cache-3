40|$|Scapulo-thoracic {{dissociation}} is an infrequent injury {{resulting from}} high energy trauma {{which is often}} associated with severe neurological and vascular injuries which may be unrecognised at the time of presentation. A 24 year-old female presented with bilateral rib fractures, pneumothorax, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries</b> following a road traffic accident. She also sustained fractures of her right scapula, odontoid, right transverse processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and a closed fracture of her right femur. Her right upper limb was later noted to be flail and pulseless, due to complete right brachial plexus injury, scapula-thoracic dissociation and subclavian artery avulsion. We managed the upper limb injuries non-operatively, and focused on resuscitation of the patient. Early exploration of the complete brachial plexus injury was not undertaken in spite of the possible associated poor functional outcome as there was no life-threatening indication...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the toxic potential of tartrazine, a food color, in different tissues in adult rat: blood, liver, kidneys, and spleen. Tartrazine was administered orally at a dose of 300 mg/kg of body weight to adult male Wistar rats during a period of 30 days. Tartrazine treatment led to an increase in platelets count, a reduction in peripheral lymphocytes and in spleen T CD 8 -lymphocytes. Furthermore, tartrazine increased the activities of hepatocellular enzymes and promoted changes in kidney biomarkers. In order to explore the possible mechanism involved, oxidative-stress assessment was performed. Results identified critical oxidative alterations in all tested organs, as shown by the promotion of lipid peroxidation and the modification of endogenous antioxidant-defense enzymes. Thus, tartrazine is able to induce in adult rats’ hematotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries</b> by changing the whole balance between oxidants and antioxidants...|$|E

40|$|Drug-induced organ {{toxicity}} is a {{major concern}} for pharmaceutical industry, due to removal of a high number of drugs from the market, as well as for public health, due to numerous hospitalizations and patient death. The organs that are the primary target for such toxicities are the liver and the kidneys since both organs are continuously exposed to high concentrations of drugs and have high metabolic capacities. The immune system {{has been shown to be}} involved in the toxicity of several drugs- inducing liver and kidney injury. In particular, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) has been shown to be the main constituent of the inflammatory processes responsible for the aggravation of drug-induced <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries.</b> In this thesis, the role of TNF-α in drug-induced organ injury was investigated.

In {{the current}} study, the authors {{determined}} whether whole-body hypothermia (WH) and its optimal duration (if any) afford protection {{to the local}} limb damage and distant lung, <b>liver,</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries</b> after BLT in rats. Rats with BLT, created by using chartaceous electricity detonators, were randomly treated with WH for 30 min, 60 min, 3 h, and 6 h (n = 12 /group). Rectal temperature and arterial blood pressure were monitored throughout. Blood and lung, liver, and kidney tissue samples were harvested for measuring tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 10, myeloperoxidase activity, hydrogen sulfide, and biomarkers of oxidative stress at 6 h after BLT. The pathologic lung injury and the water content of the lungs, liver, and kidneys and blast limb tissue were assessed. Unlike WH for 30 min, WH for 60 min reduced lung water content, lung myeloperoxidase activity, and kidney myeloperoxidase activity by 10, 39, and 28 % (all P < 0. 05), respectively. WH for 3 h attenuated distant vital organs and local traumatic limb damage and reduced myeloperoxidase activity, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde concentration, and tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 6 levels by up to 49 % (all P < 0. 01). Likewise, WH for 6 h also provided protection to such injured organs but increased blood loss from traumatic limb.

40|$|Mechanisms {{by which}} HSCs {{mobilize}} into damaged organs are currently under scrutiny. Macrophage role in these processes is investigated. In this study, {{we performed a}} flow cytometry analysis of CD 117 +CD 38 + and CD 117 +CD 90 low HSCs quantity in murine peripheral blood and bone marrow after <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> under stimulation of phagocyte mononuclear system by injection of tamerit. This study have demonstrated increased levels of CD 117 +CD 38 + HSCs in bone marrow after partial hepatectomy, along with their migration to peripheral blood in response to tamerit injection. We also demonstrated that peripheral blood CD 117 +CD 38 + HSCs levels were elevated after <b>kidney</b> <b>injury.</b> After partial hepatectomy, nochanges of CD 117 +CD 90 low HSCs quantity in investigated tissues were detected.

Group A (sham group); Group B (CBDL); and Group C (CBDL + NAC). Group C received daily dosage of NAC (100 [*]mg/kg) intraperitoneally for up to 4 weeks. Results. The rate of bridging fibrosis was higher (100 % versus 20 %, P=. 025), but the intensity of e-NOS in liver was lower in rats that received NAC (1. 3 versus 2. 7, P=. 046). The necrotic area in the kidneys among rats that received NAC was lower at week 4 (48 % versus 57 %; P<. 001). The numbers of e-NOS stained cells in kidney were similar in sham group and the two groups with CBDL. Discussion.

The present study investigated the possible effect of CCSC in alleviating the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> in D-galactose- (D-gal-) treated mice and the underlying mechanism. Mice were given a subcutaneous injection of D-gal (200 [*]mg/kg) and orally administered CCSC (200, 400, and 800 [*]mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks. Results indicated that CCSC increased the depressed body weight and organ index induced by D-gal, ameliorated the histological deterioration, and decreased the levels of ALT, AST, BUN, and CRE as compared with D-gal group. Furthermore, CCSC not only elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GPx but also upregulated the mRNA expression of SOD 1, CAT, and GPx 1, while decreasing the MDA level in D-gal-treated mice. Results of western blotting analysis showed that CCSC significantly inhibited the upregulation of expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p 65, p-p 65, p-IκBα, COX 2, and iNOS and inhibited the downregulation of IκBα protein expression caused by D-gal.

40|$|Hemoglobin-vesicles (HbV), {{encapsulating}} {{highly concentrated}} human hemoglobin in liposomes, were {{developed as a}} substitute for red blood cells (RBC) and their safety and efficacy in transfusion therapy has been confirmed in previous studies. Although HbV suspensions are structurally and physicochemically stabile for least 1 -year at room temperature, based on in vitro experiments, the issue of whether the use of long-term stored HbV after a massive hemorrhage can be effective in resuscitations without adverse, post-transfusion effects remains to be clarified. We report herein on a comparison of the systemic response and the induction of organ injuries in hemorrhagic shock model rats resuscitated using 1 -year-stored HbV, freshly packed RBC (PRBC- 0) and by 28 -day-stored packed RBC (PRBC- 28). The six-hour mortality after resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups. Arterial blood pressure and blood gas parameters revealed that, using HbV, recovery from the shock state was comparable to that when PRBC- 0 was used. Although no significant change was observed in serum parameters reflecting <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries</b> at 6 hours after resuscitation among the three resuscitation groups, results based on Evans Blue and protein leakage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the lung wet/dry weight ratio and histopathological findings indicated that HbV as well as PRBC- 0 was less predisposed to result in a post-transfusion lung injury than PRBC- 28, as evidenced by low levels of myeloperoxidase accumulation and subsequent oxidative damage in the lung. The findings reported herein indicate that 1 -year-stored HbV can effectively function as a resuscitative fluid without the induction of post-transfused lung injury and that it is comparable to fresh PRBC, suggesting that HbV is a promising RBC substitute with a long shelf-life...|$|E

Middle (10  months old) and old (20  months old) aged, male C 57 BL/ 6 N mice were fed either a low-fat diet (4  % fat) or HFD (60  % fat) for 4  months. Young (3  months old) aged mice were included as control group. HFD-induced <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injuries</b> were analyzed by serum and urine assay, histologic staining, immunohistochemistry, and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA sequencing with next-generation technology was done with RNA extracted from liver tissues. With HFD feeding, aged was associated with higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels, marked infiltration of hepatic macrophages, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (MCP 1, TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 17 A). Importantly, aged mice showed more advanced hepatic fibrosis and increased expression of fibrogenic markers (Col-I-α 1, αSMA, TGF-β 1, TGF-β 2, TGFβRII, PDGF, PDGFRβII, TIMP 1) in response to HFD. Aged mice fed on HFD also showed increased oxidative stress and TLR 4 expression. In the total RNA seq and gene ontology analysis of liver, old-aged HFD group showed significant up-regulation of genes linked to innate immune response, immune response, defense response, inflammatory response compared to middle-aged HFD group. Meanwhile, aging and HFD feeding showed significant increase in glomerular size and mesangial area, higher urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and advanced renal inflammation or fibrosis. However, the difference of HFD-induced renal injury between old-aged group and middle-aged group was not significant. The susceptibility of hepatic fibrosis as well as hepatic inflammation in response to HFD was significantly increased with aging. In addition, aging was associated with glomerular alterations and increased renal inflammation or fibrosis, while the differential effect of aging on HFD-induced renal injury was not remarkable {{as shown in the}} liver...|$|E

MethodsSystematic literature review and meta-analysis. Medline and EMBASE were searched until November 2014. We selected randomized studies in which RYR with a known content of the active substance monacolin K was tested against placebo or an active control group. Outcome measures were the effect of RYR on LDL cholesterol and incidence of adverse reactions with emphasis on <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> <b>and</b> muscle symptoms. ResultsTwenty studies were analyzed. Quality of safety assessment was low {{in the majority of}} studies. RYR lowered LDL cholesterol with 1. 02  mmol/L [− 1. 20; − 0. 83] compared to placebo. Effect of RYR on LDL was not different from statin therapy (0. 03  mmol/L [− 0. 36; 0. 41]). The incidence of <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> was 0 – 5 % and the risk was not different between treatment and control groups (risk difference − 0. 01 [− 0. 01; 0. 0] and 0. 0 [− 0. 01; 0. 02]). ConclusionsRYR exerts a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 1. 02  mmol/L LDL cholesterol.

Since {{heat shock protein}} 27 (HSP 27) protects against apoptosis, necrosis, and stabilizes F-actin, we questioned whether overexpression of human HSP 27 (huHSP 27 OE) in mice would attenuate AKI after liver IRI. Twenty-four hours after hepatic IRI, HSP 27 wild-type (WT) mice developed acute <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> with elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase and creatinine, a reduced glomerular filtration rate, and histological evidence of renal endothelial cell apoptosis and tubular injury (necrosis, vacuolization, and F-actin disruption). The huHSP 27 OE mice, however, were significantly protected against both <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> after hepatic IRI. The huHSP 27 OE mice also showed less induction of several proinflammatory mRNAs (TNF-α, MIP- 2, and keratinocyte-derived cytokine), neutrophil infiltration, and reduction in apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling assay and DNA laddering) in the kidney compared with the HSP 27 WT mice. Moreover, the huHSP 27 OE mice showed significantly less disruption of F-actin in renal proximal tubules and better preserved vascular endothelial cell integrity compared with the huHSP 27 OE mice.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the protective effects of Angelica sinensis and Angelica sinensis polysaccharide against <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> induced by irradiation of SD rats. Methods Thirty-two SD rats were randomly {{divided into four}} groups: control group, model group, Angelica decoction group and Angelica sinensis polysaccharide group. After 14 days of routine feeding, the rats were treated by intragastric administration once a day for 7 days. From the 8 th day, the rats received whole body X-ray irradiation for 2 days. The total absorbed dose was 6 Gy, and the dose rate was 92. 26 cGy/min. The rats were killed and the blood were collected from the femoral artery 3 days after irradiation. The content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and lipid peroxide (LPO) in the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> tissues was detected by colorimetric analysis. The pathological changes of the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> were observed by HE staining under microscope.

Serum aspartate aminotransferases (AST), alanine aminotransferases (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and levels of uric acid, creatinine and total protein were significantly increased in FPN-treated rats. Oxidative stress biomarkers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reduced (GSH) were significantly decreased, while lipid peroxidation (LPO) was significantly increased in treating rats in a concentration dependent manner.

Activated protein C {{is a major}} physiological anticoagulant with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities in endothelial cells. Here we tested if activated protein C would attenuate hepatic and renal injury caused by hepatic ischemia <b>and</b> reperfusion. Both <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> were significantly reduced when activated protein C was given immediately before and 2 h after liver reperfusion, in that there was reduced renal endothelial and hepatocyte apoptosis, as well as reduced hepatic and renal tubular necrosis. Further, the administration of activated protein C also reduced the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> filamentous-actin degradation, <b>and</b> neutrophil infiltration, and resulted in better preservation of vascular permeability of both the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> than is normally seen after <b>liver</b> ischemia <b>and</b> reperfusion. These protective effects of activated protein C were due to protease-activated receptor- 1 modulation since administration of a selective receptor antagonist dose-dependently inhibited its ameliorative effects in both organs after <b>liver</b> ischemia <b>and</b> reperfusion. Our results suggest the powerful multi-organ protective effects of activated protein C may improve outcome in those patients at significant risk of developing acute <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> following <b>liver</b> ischemia <b>and</b> reperfusion during transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance(NMR) based metabonomics {{was applied}} to study the hyperthyroidism by analyzing metabolic profiling of serum and urine. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine an array of characteristic metabolites in serum and urine samples from hyperthyroidism patients and then to interpret these metabolites in possible metabolic pathway. Serum samples from 33 hyperthyroidism patients together with 17 healthy volunteers and urine samples from 53 hyperthyroidism patients with 58 healthy volunteers were collected. Differences in endogenous metabolites were detected on serum and urine samples from the hyperthyroidism group and control group using multivariate statistical analysis. The results show that the hyperthyroidism group has elevated levels of choline, glucose and declined levels of VLDL, LDL, cholesterol, lactate, glycoprotein and alanine in serum samples relative to the healthy group. In urine samples, the hyperthyroidism group show increased levels of glucose, citrate, taurine and creatinine as well as decreased levels of hippurate, timethyl-amine-N-oxide, formate and succinate. These results indicate that hyperthyroidism have not only disturbed the carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and protein metabolism but also influenced energy metabolism, hepatoenteral circulation and gut microflora <b>and</b> caused <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R

Niu-Huang-Jie-Du Pian (NHJD) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine containing realgar (As 4 S 4). Realgar has been included in many traditional medicines, but is often taken as arsenite for risk assessment. To evaluate true risk of realgar and realgar-containing NHJD, their toxicity was compared with common arsenicals. In cultured cells, the LC 50 for NHJD (1200 μM) and realgar (2000 μM) was much higher than arsenite(35 μM), arsenic trioxide (280 μM), and arsenate (400 μM). Acute toxicity in mice showed more severe <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> after arsenite or arsenate, but was mild after realgar and NHJD, corresponding to cellular and tissue arsenic accumulation. The expressions of arsenic-sensitive stress gene metallothionein- 1 were increased 3 – 7 -folds after arsenite or arsenate, but were unaltered after NHJD and realgar. Thus, realgar and NHJD are much less toxic than arsenite and arsenate. The use of total arsenic to evaluate the safety of realgar and realgar-containing NHJD is inappropriate. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{widely used}} drug {{diclofenac}} can cause serious heart, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury,</b> {{which may be}} related to its ability to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we studied the mechanisms of diclofenac toxicity and the role of mitochondria therein. We found that diclofenac reduced cell growth and viability and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Strains increasingly relying on respiration for their energy production showed enhanced sensitivity to diclofenac. Furthermore, oxygen consumption was inhibited by diclofenac, suggesting that the drug inhibits respiration. To identify the site of respiratory inhibition, we investigated the effects of deletion of respiratory chain subunits on diclofenac toxicity. Whereas deletion of most subunits had no effect, loss of either Rip 1 p of complex III or Cox 9 p of complex IV resulted in enhanced resistance to diclofenac. In these deletion strains, diclofenac did not increase ROS formation as severely as in the wild-type. Our data are consistent with a mechanism of toxicity in which diclofenac inhibits respiration by interfering with Rip 1 p and Cox 9 p in the respiratory chain, resulting in ROS production that causes cell death. © 2011 SGM...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSexual {{dimorphism}} {{plays a role}} in the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> in renal injuries. However, whether sex is a {{risk factor}} in bile duct ligation (BDL) in young rats has never been examined. MethodsSix male and six female rats treated with BDL were sacrificed 2 weeks after surgery and were designated as BDL-M and BDL-F groups. The other six male and six female rats that received sham ligation were designated as sham-M and sham-F groups. Plasma biochemistry <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) -related molecules were examined. ResultsBoth BDL-M and BDL-F groups had elevated plasma aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, and transforming growth factor-β 1 levels. The BDL-F group had lower plasma AST and ALT levels than the BDL-M group. The BDL-M and BDL-F groups had elevated plasma ADMA levels. The cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT 1) level was increased in the BDL-F group as compared to the sham-F group, whereas the CAT 2 level was reduced in the both BDL-M and BDL-F groups. ConclusionWe found that young male rats were prone to higher degrees of biochemical <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> to cholestasis. Sex differences in modulation of oxidative stress markers, such as ADMA, may play a role.

40|$|NMR-Based {{metabonomics}} {{combined with}} clinical biochemical analysis and histopathological examination {{was applied to}} investigate the toxicity effects of vanadyl sulfate with insulin-like activity in male Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were administrated with VOSO 4 at doses of 15 and 45 mg/kg body weight by intragastric administration for 16 d. Urine and serum samples were collected and analyzed by H- 1 NMR experiment. Multivariate analyses were employed to identify the characteristic metabolites for the toxicity effects of vanadyl sulfate. Then the metabolic networks of these characteristic metabolites were built up using TICL (a web Tool for automatic Interpretation of Compound List). The relationship between the characteristic metabolites and the main matebolic pathways perturbed were analyzed and discussed. The differences of metabolic profiles were examined among high-dose (45 mg/kg), low-dose (15 mg/kg) of VOSO 4 and control groups. Compared to the control group, increased levels of lactate, creatinine and taurine in serum and increased excretion of trymethylamine-N- 2 -oxide, creatinine, taurine and glycine in urine were found in both high- and low-dose groups which showed an obvious dose-dependent relationship. On the other hand, the concentration of acetate and succinate were decreased in both serum and urine samples of dosed groups. These results indicate that VOSO 4 have disturbed the carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and gut microflora and the high-dosage of VOSO 4 may cause <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R

Objectives The present study was carried out to determine the protective effects of buffalo’ milk (BM) against xylene-induced <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> damage. Methods A total 42 male rats were randomly assigned into 7 groups. The rats in group I was the control. Groups II, III and IV were received 1 mL distilled water ten minutes prior to administration of xylene (X) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. Rats in groups of V,VI and VII were received 1 mL buffalo’s milk 10 minutes prior to administration of X (ip) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. The experiment repeated for 7 consecutive days. 24 hours after last administrations, all animals were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The blood was then collected for determination of biochemical tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT),aspartate aminotransferase (AST),alkaline phosphatase (ALP),blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine (CR),catalase (CAT),superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> tissues were removed, fixed and processed for light microscopy. Results Biochemical analyses indicated a significant decline in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH level and markedly increased ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, CR when compared to those in non-treated rats (control).

30|$|Our CLP murine {{model of}} sepsis {{developed}} lung, <b>liver,</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury,</b> {{as evidenced by}} histological changes, neutrophil filtration index, and biochemical variables. We found that sepsis-induced multiple organ injury was significantly attenuated in HDC−/− mice. This suggests {{that the lack of}} endogenous histamine could help to reduce sepsis-induced multiple organ injury. Alternatively, we interpret this finding to assume that histamine acts as a mediator to promote the development of multiple organ injury in sepsis. The attenuation of septic organ injury in HDC−/− mice may be partly the result of a reduction in cytokine production. Sepsis triggers overproduction of a diverse set of proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines as demonstrated in this study. Their uncontrolled, exuberant production can be deleterious to various tissues and can lead to organ injury and dysfunction [24], although the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction is multifactorial and is still being explored [25]. In agreement with the present results on cytokines in HDC−/− mice, LPS-stimulated IL- 6 production in liver tissues has been shown to fall to a low level in HDC−/− mice [26]. Moreover, in vitro experiments have reported that histamine increases IL- 6 production in B cells and glial cells [27], endothelial cells [28], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [29], although there is found to be a report showing that histamine suppresses LPS-induced gene expression and synthesis of TNF-α in peripheral blood mononuclear cells mediated by H 2 -receptors [30].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Blunt {{abdominal}} {{trauma is}} one of the important types of trauma and causes mortality in patients. Identifying the internal organ damage is necessary to proper management of trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) scan is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique to assess internal organ damages in blunt abdominal trauma. The aim of present study was to evaluate findings of CT scan with contrast in patient with blunt abdominal trauma. Methods: In this descriptive study, 290 patients with blunt abdominal trauma were studied who referred to emergency department of Imam-Reza Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Tabriz, Iran, from June 2014 to June 2015. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast was done using 1 detector CT scan machine in three phases (arterial phase, portal-venous phase and a delayed phase). Patients’ demographic information, cause of trauma, and CT scan findings were collected. Results: Mean age of patients was 26. 3 ± 8. 15 years. Male to female ratio was 1 to 0. 42. Most common causes of blunt abdominal trauma were traffic accidents in 65. 5 % of patients, fall from height in 24. 1 % patients, and fall of heavy objects in 10. 4 % patients. Among all the patients, 57. 6 % had a detectable damage based on CT scanning. Based on CT scan findings, most common injuries were spleen injury in 20. 0 % of patients, liver injury in 18. 9 % of patients, <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>injury</b> in 8. 9 %.
