5000|$|Buick {{started using}} coil springs in the 1930s {{and used the}} torque tube as the main rear axle <b>locating</b> <b>arm.</b> This {{suspension}} design became a Buick [...] "engineering trademark" [...] until it was dropped with the 1961 model year full-sized models.|$|E
50|$|Some {{front-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} use a related type of torsion beam suspension, usually called a twist-beam rear suspension, {{in which the}} rear wheels are carried on trailing arms connected by a laterally mounted torsion beam, as found on the Mitsubishi Debonair. The actual springing medium for these is usually coil springs. The torsion beam functions both as wheel <b>locating</b> <b>arm</b> and as an anti-roll bar to resist lateral motion of the wheels as the body leans in turns. Its advantages are that it is inexpensive to manufacture and install, and engages a minimum amount of interior volume, leaving more space for the carriage of passengers, cargo, and other components. Because the torsion beam acts in the lateral plane, not vertically, the twist beam axle cannot provide ride height adjustment, and it suffers, to some extent, similar car handling limitations as other beam axle suspensions. However these limitations may not be apparent on the road, because of the trend towards firmer, more sporty suspension setups with more limited wheel travel. Twist-beam rear suspensions were pioneered on the Volkswagen Golf in the early 1970s, and remain common on compact cars and minivans.|$|E

40|$|This paper <b>locates</b> <b>armed</b> ethnic {{conflicts}} in Northeast India across four interactive qualitative variables: ethnic exclusivity and colonial isolation; {{strategy of the}} armed groups; the use of violence; and external connections. The Indian state’s response to these armed {{ethnic conflicts}} is located within three conceptual parametres: proportionate use of force; dialogue and negotiations; and structural changes in the affected areas. Cases of armed ethnic conflicts utilized for empirical illustration includes the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD) and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Assam, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim led by Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chisi Swu-NSCN (IM) based in Manipur and Nagaland, and the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) based in Manipur. A few policy recommendations are also offered to better address armed ethnic conflicts in India’s Northeastern landscape. The two main research questions the paper addresses are the following: 1. Why does Northeast India suffer from multiple armed ethnic conflicts since 1947 ? 2. What has been the Indian state‘s response to the multiple armed conflicts in the Northeast...|$|R
