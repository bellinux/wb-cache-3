40|$|Agricultural vehicle {{manufacturers}} are employing new semi-active cab suspensions using Magnetorheological (MR) technology. The use of MR technology in cab suspensions {{is a logical}} next step in improving operator safety and comfort. The speed and simplicity of MR technology {{enables the use of}} low-stiffness springs without the compromise between ride and stability, and can provide roll, isolation and pitch stability. MR fluids are materials that respond to a magnetic field with a dramatic change in rheological behavior. These fluids can reversibly change instantaneously from a free-flowing liquid to a semi-solid with controllable yield strength when exposed to a magnetic field. MR systems have been developed with a modular, integrated approach that can include a damper containing MR fluid, air spring, automatic electronic <b>leveling,</b> <b>sensors,</b> controller, and CANbus data communication...|$|R

UNDULATOR SYSTEM The purpose of the undulator system is to enable the Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) process, {{which is based on}} the interaction between an electron bunch and its spontaneous undulator radiation [1]. The undulator system comprises 33 girders each containing one undulator magnet and one quadrupole. The undulator magnet can be moved {{in and out of the}} beam with so called x-translation stages and the whole girder can be moved in five degrees of freedom with cam movers. Each girder is equipped with four hydrostatic <b>leveling</b> <b>sensors</b> (HLS) and four wire position monitors (WPM), see Fig. 1. The solution was to track the X, Y and Roll parameters for both ends of each girder and calculate the deviations relative to the least square fit of all girders with a resolution of one micrometer over a time period of several weeks. Building Blocks of the ADS The HLS sensors † measure the vertical position of the sensors relative to the water surface of a half filled 2 inch diameter pipe running along the center of the girders. Three of the sensors are capacitance based and one is ultrasound based. The WPM sensors ‡ measure their position relative to a stretched wire. Two wires are stretched along the entire undulator length of 140 meters. The wire- embedded inside a conductive tube- works as an RF transmitter while the sensor consists of four RF receivers. Comparing the RF receiver responses allows calculation of the vertical and horizontal wire position relative to the sensor. Undulator magne...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} capture the {{as-built}} conditions of a structure, accurate point cloud data is required. Typically, terrestrial laser scanners are employed for the data acquisition. In addition to traditional registration techniques, the alignment of the individual scans can be performed with cloud-to-cloud registration. However, without additional control, systematic vertical er rors propagate through the network. The establishment of an independent control network is time and resource consuming. The use of <b>leveling</b> <b>sensors</b> might provide a solution. This work proposes the use of dual axis compensator data to correct the systematic vertical errors. In our experiments, we prove that the quadratic error propagation in the network {{can be reduced to}} a linear error growth. Furthermore, it is shown that the increase of data quality has a direct impact on the registration accuracy between individual scans. This approach allows surveyors to work more time-efficient when scanning larger projects and makes building surveying overall a more competitive operation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Since 2010, Kawah Ijen volcano {{has been}} {{equipped}} with seismometers, and its extremely acid volcanic lake has been monitored using temperature and <b>leveling</b> <b>sensors,</b> providing unprecedented time resolution of multiparametric data for an acidic volcanic lake. The nature {{of stress and}} mass changes of the volcano is studied by combining seismic analyses and volcanic lake measurements that were made during the strongest unrest ever recorded by the seismic network at Kawah Ijen. The distal VT earthquake swarm that occurred in May 2011 was the precursor of volcanic unrest in October 2011 that caused an increase in shallow earthquakes. The proximal VT earthquakes opened pathways for fluids to ascend by increasing the permeability of the rock matrix. The following months were characterized by two periods of strong heat and mass discharge into the lake and by the initiation of monochromatic tremor (MT) activity when steam/gases interacted with shallow portions of the aquifer. Significant seismic velocity variations, concurrent with water level rises in which water contained {{a large amount of}} steam/gas, were associated with the crises, that caused an although the unrest did not affect the shallow hydrothermal system at a large scale. Whereas shallow VT earthquakes likely reflect a magmatic intrusion, MT and relative seismic velocity changes are clearly associated with shallow hydrothermal processes. These results will facilitate the forecast of future crises. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWNAinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{intelligent}} system, {{which is}} real-time, remote, and automatic for monitoring {{the settlement of}} surface subsidence or building, was developed {{based on the principle}} of communicating vessels. The Hydrostatic <b>leveling,</b> displacement <b>sensors,</b> data acquisition and transmission, 3 G wireless communications module, computer terminals, and data processing software were integrated in the system, which has the following functions: monitoring data real-time acquisition and transmission, automatic calculation and analysis of the settlement, and early warning by remote wireless mode. The system has been successfully applied in the Minzhi station project of Shenzhen Metro Line 5 to ensure the normal operation of existing railway. Meanwhile, the high accuracy and reliability of the system are also verified by the engineering applications. It can be applied to monitor the settlement of similar projects...|$|R

30|$|The LT-OBS {{system was}} {{developed}} to continuously observe seismic events on the seafloor for 1  year (Kanazawa et al. 2009). A titanium alloy sphere, 50  cm in diameter, contains a seismic sensor, recorder, and batteries. The seismic sensors have a velocity-proportional response with a natural frequency of 1  Hz. Three component sensors are mounted on a leveling system. Signals from the seismometers are converted to digital data continuously. The sampling frequency is 100 or 200  Hz. The converted data are stored to hard disks or memory cards. Power to all electric circuits is supplied from lithium battery cells. Although the number of battery cells depends on the intended duration of recording, approximately 50 battery cells are needed for 1  year of observations. The LT-OBS is equipped with an acoustic release and communication system. The most important function of the acoustic system is to release a weight for recovery. Another function of the acoustic system is communication between the seafloor and surface. The recording unit on the OBS can be controlled from the interrogator onboard, for example, starting or stopping recording, <b>leveling</b> the <b>sensor,</b> and checking the recording unit status.|$|R
40|$|To {{be allowed}} to sell Z-suspended {{vehicles}} with dipped beam Xenon or LED lighting, Scania have to develop automatic headlight level control. This master’s thesis aims to be the foundation to that development. The thesis consists of several parts; a market analysis of how competitors to Scania and the general vehicle industry solve this problem; several available principles for detecting the amount of control needed; {{the construction of a}} test station for sensors, a control unit and components connected controlled by the control unit; a further theoretical and practical development of one principle – one rotational sensor connected between the chassis and the back drive axis; a state flow model programmed in Simulink that produces the control signal for the headlight <b>leveling</b> from the <b>sensor</b> input. Lastly the thesis gives some recommendations to the further development and implementation of automatic headlight level control on Scania vehicles...|$|R
30|$|Anomalous ground {{motion was}} {{observed}} in the NS component at the Togo Site (Fig.  2 b). The site is located on reclaimed land close to a pond shore (Fig.  1). The original accelerogram in the figure shows pulsating swings. The amplitudes of pulses to the north are larger than those to the south. In addition, the pulses indicate rather cyclic mobility behavior, which usually is observed for liquefied ground during earthquakes (e.g., Iai et al. 1995). Despite {{the shape of the}} accelerogram, liquefactions and resulting sand boils were not identified at and around the site. However, ground subsidence of ~ 20  cm was observed close to the sensor and its hood in a tree garden near the building of the town office (CRMSE 2016). Land subsidence was widely observed in and around the office. The JMA checked the setting of the accelerometer at the site shortly after the main shock because large ground motion with JMA seismic intensity of 6 lower was observed at the site. However, no issues with respect to <b>sensor</b> <b>leveling</b> or anchoring were reported.|$|R
