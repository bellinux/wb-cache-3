5|$|The score {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from various soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral {{analysis of the}} content of the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for <b>lossy</b> codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio were able to identify the <b>lossy</b> codec that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II <b>lossy</b> audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|Besides <b>lossy</b> {{compression}} methods, lossless formats are {{a significant}} alternative to MP3 because they provide unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to <b>lossy</b> compression. Lossless formats include FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), Apple Lossless and many others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lossy</b> {{compression}} formats: Most audio formats use <b>lossy</b> compression, {{to produce}} {{as small as}} possible a file compatible with the desired sound quality. There is a trade-off between size and sound quality of lossily compressed files; most formats allow different combinations—e.g., MP3 files may use between 32 (worst), 128 (reasonable) and 320 (best) kilobits per second.|$|E
25|$|If <b>lossy</b> data {{compression}} {{is used on}} audio or visual data, differences from the original signal will be introduced; if the compression is substantial, or <b>lossy</b> data is decompressed and recompressed, this may become noticeable {{in the form of}} compression artifacts. Whether these affect the perceived quality, and if so how much, depends on the compression scheme, encoder power, the characteristics of the input data, the listener’s perceptions, the listener's familiarity with artifacts, and the listening or viewing environment.|$|E
25|$|Compared to formats with <b>lossy</b> {{compression}} such as JPG, {{choosing a}} compression setting {{higher than average}} delays processing, but often does not result in a significantly smaller file size.|$|E
25|$|Even though PNG {{has been}} {{designed}} as a lossless format, PNG encoders can pre-process image data in a <b>lossy</b> fashion (so as to reduce colors used) to improve PNG compression.|$|E
25|$|In the Ogg {{multimedia}} framework, Theora {{provides a}} <b>lossy</b> video layer. The audio layer is most commonly {{provided by the}} music-oriented Vorbis format or its successor Opus. Lossless audio compression formats include FLAC, and OggPCM.|$|E
25|$|The Fibonacci number {{series is}} used for {{optional}} <b>lossy</b> compression in the IFF 8SVX audio file format used on Amiga computers. The number series compands the original audio wave similar to logarithmic methods such as µ-law.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychoacoustic model}} {{provides}} for high quality <b>lossy</b> signal compression by describing which {{parts of a}} given digital audio signal can be removed (or aggressively compressed) safely—that is, without significant losses in the (consciously) perceived quality of the sound.|$|E
25|$|The surface plasmon {{polariton}} (SPP) is an electromagnetic {{surface wave}} that travels along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under {{the condition that}} the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a <b>lossy</b> conducting medium below the plasma frequency. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a <b>lossy</b> conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.|$|E
25|$|The Sommerfeld–Zenneck wave or Zenneck wave is a non-radiative guided {{electromagnetic}} wave that {{is supported by}} a planar or spherical interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constants. This surface wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property known as evanescence. It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as for example the interface between air and a <b>lossy</b> conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the plasma frequency. Arising from original analysis by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck of the problem of wave propagation over a <b>lossy</b> earth, it exists as an exact solution to Maxwell's equations.|$|E
25|$|The {{compression}} method is usually <b>lossy,</b> meaning that some original image information is lost and cannot be restored, possibly affecting image quality. There is an optional lossless mode {{defined in the}} JPEG standard. However, this mode is not widely supported in products.|$|E
25|$|As {{the typical}} use of JPEG is a <b>lossy</b> {{compression}} method, which somewhat reduces the image fidelity, {{it should not}} be used in scenarios where the exact reproduction of the data is required (such as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain technical image processing work).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{quantization}} stage always {{results in}} a loss of information, JPEG standard is always a <b>lossy</b> compression codec. (Information is lost both in quantizing and rounding of the floating-point numbers.) Even if the quantization matrix is a matrix of ones, information will still be lost in the rounding step.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, current high-efficiency digital {{color image}} data {{compression}} schemes such as JPEG and MPEG store RGB color internally in YCBCR format, a digital luminance-chrominance format based on YPBPR. The use of YCBCR also allows to perform <b>lossy</b> subsampling with the chroma channels (typically to 4:2:2 or 4:1:1 ratios), which it aids {{to reduce the}} resultant file size.|$|E
25|$|Engaged {{as a minor}} to Henri de <b>Lossy,</b> Baron of Ville, Patti wed three times: first, in 1868, to Henri de Roger de Cahusac, Marquess of Caux (1826–1889). The {{marriage}} soon collapsed; {{both had}} affairs and de Caux was granted a legal separation in 1877 and divorced in 1885. The union was dissolved with bitterness and cost her half her fortune.|$|E
25|$|Some {{combination}} of porous absorption with these complementary methods is typically preferred for their simplicity, affordability, and convenience, but resonant bass traps {{are more effective}} for absorbing strong room resonances where the aforementioned complimentary methods are inadequate or impractical, particularly when the geometry of the room causes problematic narrow-band resonances that affect the low bass and {{the composition of the}} room boundaries is highly reflective rather than acoustically <b>lossy.</b>|$|E
25|$|High-dynamic-range {{photographs}} are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using exposure bracketing, {{and then later}} merging them into a single HDR image, usually within a photo manipulation program). Digital images are often encoded in a camera's raw image format, because 8-bit JPEG encoding does not offer a wide enough range of values to allow fine transitions (and regarding HDR, later introduces undesirable effects due to <b>lossy</b> compression).|$|E
25|$|Then the {{watermarked}} {{digital signal}} is transmitted or stored, usually transmitted to another person. If this person makes a modification, {{this is called}} an attack. While the modification may not be malicious, the term attack arises from copyright protection application, where third parties may attempt to remove the digital watermark through modification. There are many possible modifications, for example, <b>lossy</b> compression of the data (in which resolution is diminished), cropping an image or video, or intentionally adding noise.|$|E
25|$|HD Photo (previously {{known as}} Windows Media Photo) is a {{photographic}} still image file format, that is introduced with Windows Vista. It supports {{features such as}} high dynamic range imaging, <b>lossy</b> as well as lossless compression, up to 32-bpp fixed or floating point representation, transparency, RGB, CMYK and n-channel color spaces, Radiance RGBE, embedded ICC color profiles, multiple images per file and support for Exif and XMP metadata formats. It is the preferred image format for XPS documents.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the options}} in the JPEG {{standard}} are not commonly used, and as mentioned above, most image software uses the simpler JFIF format when creating a JPEG file, which among other things specifies the encoding method. Here is {{a brief description of}} one of the more common methods of encoding when applied to an input that has 24 bits per pixel (eight each of red, green, and blue). This particular option is a <b>lossy</b> data compression method.|$|E
25|$|Since {{panels of}} {{infinite}} dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear {{radiation from the}} moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted {{from the rear of}} the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, <b>lossy</b> wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, visco-elastic materials (e.g., mineral-loaded bitumen) or thin lead sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{efficiency}} of encoders is typically {{defined by the}} bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the bit depth and sampling rate of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the Compact Disc (CD) parameters as references (44.1 kHz, 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2×16 bit), or sometimes the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) SP parameters (48kHz, 2×16 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with {{use of the term}} compression ratio for <b>lossy</b> encoders.|$|E
25|$|These {{artifacts}} can {{be reduced}} by choosing {{a lower level of}} compression; they may be completely avoided by saving an image using a lossless file format, though this will result in a larger file size. The images created with ray-tracing programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain. Certain low-intensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images, but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed, usually resulting in unacceptable quality. Consider the example below, demonstrating the effect of <b>lossy</b> compression on an edge detection processing step.|$|E
25|$|The MP3 <b>lossy</b> {{audio data}} {{compression}} algorithm {{takes advantage of}} a perceptual limitation of human hearing called auditory masking. In 1894, the American physicist Alfred M. Mayer reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency. In 1959, Richard Ehmer described {{a complete set of}} auditory curves regarding this phenomenon. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy. This work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to Fletcher, and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and critical bandwidths.|$|E
25|$|MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more {{commonly}} referred to as MP3 (or mp3), is an audio coding format for digital audio. It uses a form of <b>lossy</b> data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio, which is important for both transmission and storage concerns, while still retaining a comparable level of sound quality. Also designed as a streamable format, segments of a transmission can be lost without affecting the ability to decode later segments.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{claims that}} audio encoded with WMA sounds better than MP3 {{at the same}} bit rate; Microsoft also claims that audio encoded with WMA at lower bit rates sound better than MP3 at higher bit rates. Double blind {{listening}} tests with other <b>lossy</b> audio codecs have shown varying results, from failure to support Microsoft's claims about its superior quality to supremacy over other codecs. One independent test conducted in May 2004 at 128kbit/s showed that WMA was roughly equivalent to LAME MP3; inferior to AAC and Vorbis; and superior to ATRAC3 (software version).|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{relations}} initially dominated {{relations with}} the neighboring states, while those of the European colonial powers came into the background. In Cambodia and Laos, Vietnam gained the supremacy, which Rama II initially accepted. When a rebellion broke out in Vietnam, under Rama III. 1833-34 tried to subdue the Vietnamese militarily, but {{this led to a}} <b>lossy</b> defeat of the Siamese troops. In the 1840s, however, the Khmer himself succeeded in expelling the Vietnamese, which subsequently led to a higher influence of Siams in Cambodia. At the same time Siam remained sent tribute to China.|$|E
25|$|In the 80s and 90s before {{broadband}} Internet access became widely available, bootlegs (CD-Rs or Compact Cassette copies) circulated mostly via snail mail. Today, {{all of the}} unauthorised Led Zeppelin {{material is}} available on the Internet, mostly on BitTorrent resources in lossless media formats. Decoding and redistributing audio in <b>lossy</b> formats (such as MP3) is strongly frowned upon among the trading community as it diminishes the quality of the audio and can make it difficult for recipients to know if they are receiving the best available copy. During the 2000s, previously uncirculated audience recordings surfaced mostly on the BitTorrent resources.|$|E
25|$|All DRM to date can {{therefore}} be bypassed by recording this signal and digitally storing and distributing it in a non DRM limited form, by anyone who has the technical means of recording the analog stream. Furthermore, the analog hole cannot be overcome without the additional protection of externally imposed restrictions, such as legal regulations, because the vulnerability is inherent to all analog means of transmission. However, the conversion from digital to analog and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using <b>lossy</b> digital formats. HDCP {{is an attempt to}} plug the analog hole, although it is largely ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Another example where sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} is optimal arises {{under the}} additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal <b>lossy</b> compression. This setting is relevant {{in cases where}} the joint effect of sampling and quantization is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and quantizing a random signal. For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{practice}} is {{to investigate the}} applicability of porous bass trap absorbers before investigating resonant or hybridized bass trap absorbers. Complementary methods to use in combination with porous absorption include drywall/stud construction of walls/ceiling and filled with insulation {{as a form of}} highly damped resonant bass trapping using the drywall itself as the membrane. The combination of inherently <b>lossy</b> resonant room boundaries and paper or foil faced porous bass trap absorption deep in the tricorners (where three room boundaries meet) is often sufficient to attain acceptable bass response even in listening rooms with somewhat problematic resonances.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>lossy</b> formats exist. Among these, mp3PRO, AAC, and MP2 are {{all members}} of the same {{technological}} family as MP3 and depend on roughly similar psychoacoustic models. The Fraunhofer Society owns many of the basic patents underlying these formats as well, with others held by Alcatel-Lucent, and Thomson Consumer Electronics. There are also open compression formats like Opus and Vorbis that are available free of charge and without any known patent restrictions. Some of the newer audio compression formats, such as AAC, WMA Pro and Vorbis, are free of some limitations inherent to the MP3 format that cannot be overcome by any MP3 encoder.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio Voice (WMA Voice) is a <b>lossy</b> {{audio codec}} that competes with Speex (used in Microsoft's own Xbox Live online service), ACELP, and other codecs. Designed for low-bandwidth, voice {{playback}} applications, it employs low-pass and high-pass filtering of sound outside the human speech frequency range to achieve higher compression efficiency than WMA. It can automatically detect sections of an audio track containing both voice {{and music and}} use the standard WMA compression algorithm instead. WMA Voice supports up to 22.05kHz for a single channel (mono) only. Encoding is limited to constant bit rate (CBR) and up to 20kbit/s. The first and only version of the codec is WMA 9 Voice.|$|E
25|$|Both the Vampire and the Greif flew at the 3rd Rhön {{contests}} in {{the summer}} of 1922. It was expected than the Greif would out-perform the older Vampyr but despite encouraging early trials it did not; on the same day and under similar conditions the Vampyr flew for over three hours but the Greif could only manage 26 minutes. The cut-out in the leading edge for the pilot seems to have greatly increased the induced drag; the losses were much greater than those caused by similar sized trailing edge cut-outs on other designs, as the pressure differences between upper and lower surfaces and the strength of the associated <b>lossy</b> vortexes are smaller there.|$|E
