5|$|Fredericton served {{during the}} Battle of the Atlantic from 1941 to 1945. During 1942 she escorted oil tankers from the Caribbean to New York City. From 1943 to 1945 she escorted convoys in the Western Atlantic {{and then later}} on across the Atlantic to Northern Ireland. She was {{decommissioned}} on 14 July 1945. Some question as to her final disposition <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> a possible error in Lloyd's Register. Either she was sold for scrap in 1946 or ended up as a Panamanian-flagged Japanese whaler which was used until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Darrell Huff’s How to <b>Lie</b> <b>with</b> Statistics was the {{inspiration}} for How to <b>Lie</b> <b>with</b> Maps, in which the author showed that geometric distortion and graphic generalization of data are unavoidable elements of cartographic representation. New examples of how ill-conceived or deliberately contrived statistical maps can greatly distort geographic reality demonstrate that <b>lying</b> <b>with</b> maps is a special case of <b>lying</b> <b>with</b> statistics. Issues addressed include the effects of map scale on geometry and feature selection, the importance of using a symbolization metaphor appropriate to the data {{and the power of}} data classification to either reveal meaningful spatial trends or promote misleading interpretations...|$|R

The law states {{that it is the}} responsibility of the municipality to give instruction and fund institutions (this includes teaching, substitute teaching, administration and specialist services), and provide special education if required. There are no entry requirements for pupils, and the acceptance rate is 100% at six years of age.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, Barfi {{is shown}} to be gravely ill in a {{hospital}} and is close to death. Jhilmil arrives and <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> Barfi in his hospital bed as Shruti narrates that the two died peacefully together, not wanting to leave each other behind in life or death. The film closes showing the happy days of Barfi and Jhilmil as credits roll.|$|E
5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E

5|$|The {{court held}} that it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his nearsightedness, could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the guardrail. According to the court, the largest part of the blame <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown at half-mast {{as a sign}} of mourning. The {{decision}} to do so <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning.

Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.|$|E

5|$|Later, John and Tom {{get drunk}} {{and decide to}} kill Brandon.

Tom shoots Candace in the head as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body and tries to shoot Lana but John stops him. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> Brandon's body. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes {{her away from the}} scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the national park and the protection {{is based on the}} Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which takes its mandate from the requirements in the Svalbard Treaty to protect the environment of the archipelago. The overall responsibility for protection <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated management to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of Svalbard. The latter performs all day-to-day practical management, including registration and inspection. In aspects related to cultural heritage, the Governor reports to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and in issues relating to pollution, to the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. While it has no authority, the Norwegian Polar Institute performs monitoring, mapping and research.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipalities}} {{are governed}} by both a board of mayor and aldermen and a municipal council. The municipal council, which is titled island council in the special municipalities, is elected every four years. The number of members in the council ranges from nine members for the smallest municipalities to forty-five members for the largest. It is the highest administrative body in the municipality and controls public policy. The executive power <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the executive board, which consists of a mayor, titled lieutenant governor in the special municipalities, and multiple aldermen, titled island deputies in the special municipalities. The mayor is appointed for six years at a time by the crown and the alderman are elected by the municipal council, typically after each municipal election. The mayor is responsible for public order and {{is the first in}} command during emergencies, all other tasks are distributed freely between mayor and aldermen. The exact portfolio for each person differs between each municipality.|$|E

5|$|The supreme {{responsibility}} for conservation <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated the management to the Governor of Svalbard and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. The foundation for conservation {{was established in}} the Svalbard Treaty of 1920, and has been further specified in the Svalbard Environmental Act of 2001. The first round of protection took force on 1 July 1973, when most of the current protected areas came into effect. This included the two large nature reserves and three of the national parks. Moffen Nature Reserve was established in 1983, followed by four national parks, three nature reserves and one geotope protection area between 2002 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{began the}} 1902 season well and, facing an Ashes series against Australia, began {{planning}} for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between Bill Lockwood and Schofield Haigh. However, {{on the morning of}} the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings, although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren's biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> him for not appealing against the light—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking Gilbert Jessop to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.|$|E

5|$|Roméo Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, {{served as}} the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along {{information}} to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non-governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. With the media reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how little the general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame <b>lies</b> <b>with</b> the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.|$|E
