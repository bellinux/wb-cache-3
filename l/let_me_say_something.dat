40|$|Robert Hogan’s paper {{provided}} an orientation {{to the topic}} of executive development along with a focus on particular aspects of executive competence that lend themselves to interventions by I/O psychologists. Hogan also provided a rationale for executive development efforts guided by assessment. The methods by which we assess executive competence and help direct development are the subject of this paper. We will offer a pragmatic view, focusing on the utility of survey and self-report assessment methods in support of executive coaching. Because the title of this session is “models of executive education, ” <b>let</b> <b>me</b> begin by <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> about our perspective on managerial development. We believe that the career development of managers should {{be thought of as a}} steady progression from generic to more individualized and situational learning. The initial stage of a manager’s career typically involves the acquisition and development of a set of basic skills. Generic and prescriptive in nature, this is information that can be easily transmitted in group settings. It is advice that is applicable to virtually all managers and to a wide variety of situations and circumstances...|$|R

It frightened and in a sense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence of something that was not human, something alien to me as a man, which I could fear and even adore as humanity would adore that which is Divine, but with which I had no desire to mix. Moreover, was it divine, or was it something very different? I did not know, I only knew that it was not for me; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to set within my lantern.|$|E

When a stranger enters the dancing-hall, he sees {{one end of the}} room taken up by the ladies, who sit dismally in a group by themselves; in the other end stand their pensive partners that are to be; but no more intercourse between the sexes than there is between two countries at war. The ladies indeed may ogle, and the gentlemen sigh; but an embargo is laid on any closer commerce. At length, to interrupt hostilities, the lady directress, or intendant, or what you will, pitches upon a lady and gentleman to walk a minuet; which they perform with a formality that approaches to despondence. After five or six couple have thus walked the gantlet, all stand up to country dances; each gentleman furnished with a partner from the aforesaid lady directress; so they dance much, say nothing, and thus concludes our assembly. I told a Scotch gentleman that such profound silence resembled the ancient procession of the Roman matrons in honor of Ceres; and the Scotch gentleman told me (and, faith, I believe he was right) that I was a very great pedant for my pains.|$|E

40|$|In the Report on the Entozoa {{collected}} by H. M. S. "Challenger” Dr O. von Linstow described two new tapeworms, which he named Tetrabothrium torulosum and T. auriculatum. The resemblance {{of the head}} of T. auriculatum with that of Prosthecocotyle Forsteri described by Monticelli seemed to me to indicate that the Tetrabothrium described by Linstow probably belonged to the genus Prosthecocotyle. Through the kindness of Sir John Murray, I received from the British Museum the original specimens for inspection, for which I wish to express here my warmest thanks. The following lines give the results of my examination; but before entering upon the description, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> on the systematic position of these two animals. As I have already remarked, Prof. Monticelli has rightly erected a new genus named Prosthecocotyle for the tapeworm Tœnia Forsteri, Krefft. To this genus belongs, besides P. Forsteri, other parasites of birds which have been placed in the genera Tœnia, Tetrabothrium, Amphoterocotyle, Bothridiotœnia, Bothriocephalus. According to my researches the following species belong to the genus Prosthecocotyle:— 1. P. Forsteri (Krefft), (syn. Tœnia Forsteri, Krefft), from Delphinus Forsteri (Gray) and Delphinus delphinus, L. 2. P. Monticellii, Fuhrmann (syn. Tœnia erostris, ex parte, Bothridiotœnia erostris, var. minor, Lönnberg), from Fulmarus glacialis, L. 3. P. umbrella, Fuhrmann, from Diomedea sp. (?). 4. P. torulosa (Linstow), (syn.

40|$|I want {{to thank}} my critics for their {{excellent}} comments. 1 Before I try to respond to them, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the project that I intend to be contributing to. In my book, I ask the question: which rights should be universal? The book {{is the first of}} two volumes that try to answer it. In the first volume, which {{is the only one that}} has been published so far, I focus on the big picture and outline, in general terms, a list of nine basic rights. I provide both consequentialist and non-consequentialist rationales for the rights on my list. In the second volume Human Rights and Human Well-Being (forthcoming), I explain why I favor the consequentialist rationale over the non-consequentialist rationale, I specify more precisely the contours of the basic rights, and I consider which other rights should be universal. One way of understanding my book is as an attempt to continue the Enlightenment project of identifying universal rights that all governments should guarantee for their people, but without the Enlightenment epistemology. The Declaration of Independence famously says: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ” In my book, I discuss why the drafters claimed that those rights were self-evident, when, in retrospect, it i...|$|E

In order to place these five stories in some logical perspective for the readers of them, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the genesis of each. "Fred's Paddle" originates in the death of my mother, Margaret G. Scully, in April of 1982. She was a strong-willed, outspoken, well-educated, productive, curious, and distinctly moral woman. "Carla's Correspondence" is my response to Henry James' "A Bundle of Letters. " It is written in the same epistolary mode but with radically different characters. "Let's Go Home" originates in and chronicles the gathering dusk of my own aunt Dorothy's increasing infirmity brought on by nothing more than the accumulation of years. "Jesus and the Angels" is a story about a man who sees North America unrealistically through wishful eyes. It is also about the randomness of tragedy which strikes good, hardworking people for no apparent reason. And "Triple" was inspired by my own recent surgery and my delight at having survived it. These stories are about life and death in modern America and they come from the heart. They are quest stories; quests to find value and purpose in living, to affirm value and worth in the lives of those who are no longer with us. They attempt to suggest my own meager measure of understanding and appreciation of and for those significant events that shape our lives and my acceptance of those coincidental or circumstantial events which seemingly make no sense but which also inexorably alter us...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} major factors {{interacting}} with readability measures in validity studies are identified and described. The {{basis for the}} analysis presented are thirty-six experimental studies {{of the effect of}} readability variables upon reader comprehension and/or retention. Emphasis is placed on the interacting nature of the factors involved. When first asked to present this paper, I suggested a title different from the one finally selected. My suggestion, I felt, might be catchier, and would certainly result in a briefer address. Title and talk were to be "Does Readability Make a Difference? " "Sometimes. " The paper {{turned out to be a}} bit longer than that, but the answer, you will see, was an appropriate summary. And the title finally selected, "A Second Look at the Validity of Readability Formulas, " is also appropriate. Here is why, in a nutshell. Table 1 is a reminder that there are two chief ways of looking at the validity of readability formulas. Most research workers have looked at the first way, which involves the prediction of readable writing. This refers to a formula's ability to assign accurate scores to a large number of different passages of known difficulty. I want to emphasize the second way of looking at validity, which involves the production of readable writing. This refers to modifying a passage into more and/or less readable versions according to formula score, then checking to see if they yield a measurable difference in reader performance or behavior. Before turning to the second way of looking at validity, however, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> briefly about the first. aAn invited address presented at the annual meeting of the National Reading Conference, St...|$|E
