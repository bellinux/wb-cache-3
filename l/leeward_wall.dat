40|$|Abstract. CFD {{calculations}} {{are carried}} out using the standard, RNG and realizable κ-ε turbulence models to simulate the airflow and pollutant dispersion inside an isolated street canyon. The computed air velocity vector fields and pollutant concentration contours show that all the three studied κ-ε models produce a very similar clockwise vortex structure that carries the pollutants released from the line source on the street floor towards the leeward side of the canyon. The calculated non-dimensional pollutant concentration distributions on both the leeward and windward walls of the canyon are compared with the wind tunnel measured data. It is revealed that (1) on the windward wall of the canyon, the calculated pollutant concentrations using the standard, RNG and realizable κ-ε models are all in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, (2) the RNG and realizable κ-ε models provide almost the same results for pollutant concentration distributions on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the canyon, (3) the RNG and realizable κ- ε models overestimate greatly the pollutant concentration values on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the canyon, whereas the concentration distributions predicted by the standard κ-ε model on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> are in reasonable agreement with the wind tunnel data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics simulation of airflow and fine particle (PM 2. 5) dispersion in the street canyon in Hong Kong, using large eddy simulation. An aspect ratio (AR) of 2. 7 and a Reynolds number of 5 x 10 6 with a one main vortex, were used. This study focused mainly on the vehicle-induced momentum source and PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured at 10 altitudes near the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> in the street canyon, to provide high resolution measurements for model validation. The simulated PM 2. 5 concentrations agreed well with the measurements, (R= 0. 85). The concentration was higher at the lower part near the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> than the upper part. Higher concentration was found near the roof level. A near-uniform vertical dispersion of PM 2. 5 near the windward wall was demonstrated; and the average concentrations were lower than found near the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall.</b> The intermittent escape of the PM 2. 5 above the canyon at the roof level occurred mainly at the centre and near windward wall areas. The results demonstrated that {{a reduction in the}} AR can be conducive to pollutant dispersion in street canyon planning. The findings of this research would inform building designers to formulate effective strategies such as positioning of ventilation air intake, for the control of ingress of PM 2. 5 into building environments.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of pollutants exhausted from a building roof stack {{located in the}} wake of a tower is investigated by means of the realizable k–ɛ turbulence model. Variations in stack height and pollutant exhaust velocity are considered to assess their influence on the distribution of pollutant concentrations in the neighbourhood of the emitting building. In order to determine optimum locations for fresh-air intakes, the worst case is considered, namely when the wind originates directly upstream of the tower and places the emitting building in its wake. Special attention is given to the evolution of the plume and distribution of pollutant concentrations on the roof and windward wall of the emitting building, as well as on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the upwind tower. Simulation results are compared to wind tunnel experiments conducted in a boundary layer wind tunnel. For this particular configuration, the paper shows that increasing the stack height has an effect similar to that obtained by increasing the momentum ratio, but with some differences, depending upon which wall of the two buildings is considered. On the emitting building, the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> has the lowest concentration values for all stack heights and momentum ratios considered; thus this is the best location for fresh-air intakes. However, for the tower, fresh-air intakes should not be located on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> due to high pollutant concentrations. The results show completely different pollutant dispersion patterns from those for an isolated building. This highlights the importance of accounting for structures that lie in close proximity to the emitting building...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Flow and traffic-originated {{pollutant}} dispersion {{in an urban}} street canyon with avenue-like tree planting have been studied by means of wind tunnel and CFD investigations. The study comprises tree planting of different crown porosity, planted in two rows within a canyon of street width to building height ratio W/H = 2 and street length to building height ratio L/H = 10 exposed to a perpendicular approaching boundary layer flow. Numerical simulations have been performed with the commercial CFD code FLUENT™ by employing the RSM turbulence model. In the presence of tree planting, both measurements and simulations show considerable larger pollutant concentrations in proximity of the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> and slightly lower concentrations in proximity of the windward wall {{in comparison to the}} tree-less street canyon. In particular, FLUENT slightly underestimated pollutant concentrations in proximity of the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> in all cases studied, while near the windward wall there is no general tendency towards underestimation or overestimation. Overall, numerical computations compare qualitatively well with experimental data. Results from commonly used statistical tests also suggest the CFD predictions to be satisfactory.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the study of flow and traffic exhaust {{dispersion}} in urban street canyons with avenue-like tree planting. The influence of tree planting with different crown porosity was investigated. Wind tunnel experiments for perpendicular approaching flow showed that avenue-like tree planting cause increases in exhaust concentrations at the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> as tree crowns reduce the vortex found in the outer regions of the tree-free street canyon and the vertically entering volume flow rate at the canyon-roof top interface. This results in less ventilation and consequently larger concentrations in proximity of the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall.</b> At the windward wall, decreases in concentration are due to the upward moving stream in front of the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> which extends farther into the skimming above roof flow and is better mixed. The clean air entrained in front of the windward wall mixes with air inside the street canyon leading to smaller concentrations. Experiments performed in the wind tunnel with different tree crown porosities did not indicate substantial changes in the flow and concentration fields. The porous model crowns investigated behaved almost like impermeable objects when arranged in a sheltered position and wind speeds are relatively small as in the street canyon. The above described experiments have been also investigated by means of numerical simulations with the CFD code FLUENT(tm), rarely applied to this type of problems. The standard k-e turbulence model and the Reynolds Stress Model were used for flow while the Eulerian advection diffusion scheme has been used for dispersion. Both models reproduced qualitatively the main aspects found in wind tunnel experiments, even though they underestimated flow velocities. Improvement of CFD dispersion performance was obtained by increasing the diffusivity through the turbulent Schmidt number Sct. Overall we found that the k-e model failed to capture the complex structure of dispersion process in the presence of tree planting as it would require unphysical low Sct values. On the other hand the RSM turbulence model agreed fairly well with experiments by slightly reducing the standard Sct. The results obtained in this work by combining wind tunnel experiments and CFD based simulations to investigate this novel aspect of research suggest ways to obtain quantitative information for assessment, planning and implementation of exposure mitigation using trees in urban street canyons...|$|E
5000|$|At first, it was {{speculated that}} the glass came off the {{building}} due to impact from debris or due to high-speed winds in the confined spaces. However, flying glass debris must be entirely governed by drag and lift forces that overcome gravity for a considerable time period. Also, the high-wind-speed-in-confined-spaces theory is not entirely justified since the height of damage seen in the tower exceeded too significantly {{the height of the}} Chase Center parking garage next to the tower. This theory was proposed because an increase in wind speed produces a drop in external pressure. This drop in pressure at the side and <b>leeward</b> <b>walls,</b> combined with the normal, higher pressure inside the building would result in a force that could possibly overcome design pressures causing the window to separate.

40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the effects of}} avenues of trees in urban street canyons on traffic pollutant dispersion. We describe various wind-tunnel experiments with different tree-avenue models in combination with variations in street-canyon aspect ratio W/H (with W the street-canyon width and H the building height) and approaching wind direction. Compared to tree-free street canyons, in general, higher pollutant concentrations are found. Avenues of trees do not suppress canyon vortices, although the air ventilation in canyons is hindered significantly. For a perpendicular wind direction, increases in wall-average and wall-maximum concentrations at the <b>leeward</b> canyon <b>wall</b> and decreases in wall-average concentrations at the windward wall are found. For oblique and perpendicular wind directions, increases at both canyon walls are obtained. The strongest effects of avenues of trees on traffic pollutant dispersion are observed for oblique wind directions for which also the largest concentrations at the canyon walls are found. Thus, the prevailing assumption that attributes the most harmful dispersion conditions to a perpendicular wind direction does not hold for street canyons with avenues of trees.

The study showed {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude of the negative pressure coefficients on the <b>leeward</b> roof and <b>wall,</b> with an increase in aspect ratio, for oblique approach winds.

For small tree crowns, only little changes in concentration were measured, however, increasing crown diameters led to increasing concentrations at the <b>leeward</b> street canyon <b>wall</b> associated with a reduction of local concentrations at the windward wall. For some cases, a variation of trunk height led to a modification of the concentration pattern on the walls. Increasing the tree spacing resulted in a noticeable concentration decrease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the air {{exchange}} velocity between the urban canyon cavity {{and the air}} layer above roof level is quantified, using a two-dimensional k-ε model, and correlated with the air cavity mean temperature, for two cases: <b>leeward</b> and downward <b>wall</b> heating. The spatial thermal differences are evaluated by assuming a wall temperature higher than the air temperature, with this difference ranging between 0 and 16 K. The undisturbed wind velocity above the roof level is varied from 1 to 6 ms- 1 and the canyon aspect ratio is 1. 5, which corresponds to a skimming flow regime. The model predicts two situations, which correspond to air flow regimes where one or two eddies are formed, respectively: (a) for high wind speed, the air inside the cavity is negligible affect by the buoyancy effect and the {{air exchange}} velocity linearly increases {{with the increase of}} wind velocity; (b) for low wind speed, when the buoyancy forces are stronger than the wind induced forces, the air exchange velocity is not a linear function with the wind velocity. The transition wind velocity between (a) and (b) {{is a function of the}} wall-air temperature difference. The situation of windward heated wall and two eddies air flow regime is the most favorable to extract heat from the cavity. On the contrary, the heated air is hardly extracted from the cavity when only the wind induced eddy is predicted and windward wall is heated.

Wind incidence angles and side ratio of buildings significantly affect the suction on sidewalls and <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the buildings. As the side ratio approaches to about 3.0, the final steady reattachment of the flow takes place on side faces at 0 ° wind incidence angle. On the other hand, the negative pressure coefficient becomes almost constant as the side ratio exceeds 3.0, indicating that when depth is about three times the breadth, the lower limit of the wake width, which is approximately the full width of the body, is obtained.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, {{the number of people}} living in the world’s urban areas {{exceeded}} that of those living in the countryside. Such urbanisation tends to modify the climates of towns and cities {{as a result of a}} number of factors which together form the ‘urban heat island’ effect. In order to better design buildings and urban areas to cope with these effects, it is first necessary to understand the heat transfer mechanisms which are taking place. The aim of the current research has therefore been to provide convective heat transfer data appropriate for low-rise urban environments by investigating the effects of wind speed, direction and street geometry. The research has employed the naphthalene sublimation technique which has been extended in several fundamental areas including development of a novel approach to measure the rate of sublimation from wind tunnel models. This technique has permitted measurements to be made over an array of discrete locations, revealing the variation across building surfaces. The uncertainty in the convective heat transfer coefficients obtained was calculated to be approximately ± 6 %. Tests were conducted in the BRE wind tunnel with an atmospheric boundary layer simulation appropriate to inner city areas. Cube models were arranged so as to form long rows of flat-roofed buildings referred to as ‘street canyons’. A series of correlations have been derived from the experimental results from which the rate of convection occurring from each building surface may be obtained with respect to wind speed. The greatest rates of convective heat transfer have been shown to occur at the top of the windward wall and leading edge of the roof, the lowest rates from the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of a building. Convection was found to be reduced in narrow street canyons. In wider street canyons, the convective coefficients on the exposed windward and roof surfaces of buildings were higher, but the values on the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> are lessened due to the distancing of the downstream windward vortex. The effect of wind direction was found to be relatively small and therefore it is proposed that the convective heat transfer relationships presented may be applied irrespective of wind direction.

Earlier studies provide evidence that when a surface inside an urban street canyon is at a higher temperature than that of local ambient air, buoyancy forces can modify the mechanically-induced circulation within the canyons (i. e., gaps between buildings). The aspect ratio of the urban canyon is a critical factor in the manifestation of the buoyancy parameter. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed on urban street canyons with six different aspect ratios, focusing on the special case where the <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> is at a greater temperature than local ambient air. A non-dimensional measure of the influence of buoyancy is used to predict demarcations between the flow regimes. Simulations are performed under a range of buoyancy conditions, including beyond those of previous studies. Observations from a field experiment and a wind tunnel experiment are used to validate the results. Singapore.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel studies on 1 [*]:[*] 300 scaled-down models of rectangular buildings having the same plan area and height but different side ratios ranging from 0. 25 to 4. Fluctuating values of wind pressures are measured at pressure points on all surfaces of models and mean, maximum, minimum, and r. m. s. values of pressure coefficients are evaluated. Effectiveness of the side ratios of models in changing the surface pressure distribution is assessed at wind incidence angle of 0 ° to 90 ° at an interval of 15 °. Side ratio of models has considerable effects on the magnitude and distribution of wind pressure on leeward and sidewalls but it has very limited effect on windward walls at wind incidence angle of 0 °. For building models with constant cross section, change in side ratio does not significantly affect the general magnitude of peak pressures and peak suctions, but rather the wind angle at which they occur. The regression equation is also proposed to predict the mean pressure coefficient on <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> and side wall of rectangular models having different side ratios at 0 ° wind incidence angle...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a wind tunnel study of near-field pollutant dispersion from rooftop emissions of two multiple building configurations. The configurations mainly consisted of an emitting building {{in the presence of}} an upstream and a downstream building. The various parameters that were varied include: stack height (hs), stack location (Xs), spacing between upstream and emitting building (S 1), spacing between downstream and emitting building (S 2) and exhaust momentum ratio (M). Gas concentrations were measured at various building surfaces using a gas chromatograph. The wind tunnel dilutions were also compared to ASHRAE, 2007 and 2011 models. Results show that a taller upstream and a taller downstream building inhibit the plume from dispersing, thereby increasing the pollutant concentrations {{on the roof of the}} emitting building and <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the upstream building. In general, the spacing between the upstream and emitting buildings, besides the heights of each building were found to be critical parameters influencing the plume characteristics. ASHRAE, 2007 predictions were found to be overly conservative for the isolated building, while ASHRAE, 2011 estimates compared well with experimental data for a few cases. Safe placement of stack and intake on various building surfaces to avoid plume re-ingestion are suggested based on this study...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} near-field pollutant dispersion characteristics of upstream buildings in the built environment and compares them to the ASHRAE 2007 model. Wind tunnel simulations were performed for nine different building configurations for three exhaust momentum ratios (M) and three stack heights (hs). The effect of spacing (S) between the buildings and stack location from the upwind edge of the emitting building (X) were also investigated. Measurements of gas concentrations were performed {{on the roof and}} <b>leeward</b> <b>wall</b> of the emitting and upstream buildings. Data show that within the recirculation zone a change in along wind dimension of the upstream building has a negligible effect on the dilution of emissions from the downwind building. However, spacing between buildings and the height of the upstream building were found to be critical parameters in assessing plume dilution. The plume geometry is largely governed by the upwind dimensions of the upstream building. ASHRAE (2007) predicts lower dilution for all cases examined, leading to conservative or very conservative design. However, the ASHRAE 2007 cannot model the effect of upstream buildings, thus further investigation of its formulations is required. Guidelines for placement of intake and stack {{on the roof of the}} building to avoid problems of re-ingestion are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{in buildings}} {{can create a}} comfortable and healthy indoor environment, and can save energy compared to mechanical ventilation systems. In building design the prediction of ventilation can be difficult; cases of wind-driven single-sided ventilation, where the effects of turbulence dominate, are particularly problematic to simulate. In order to investigate the mechanism of natural ventilation driven by wind force, large-eddy simulation (LES) is used. In the meanwhile, detailed airflow fields, such as mean and fluctuating velocity and pressure distribution inside and around building-like models were measured by wind tunnel tests and compared to LES results for model validation. Three ventilation cases, single-sided ventilation with an opening in windward wall, single-sided ventilation with an opening in <b>leeward</b> <b>wall,</b> and cross ventilation, are studied. In the wind tunnel, a laser Doppler anemometry was used to provide accurate and detailed velocity data. In LES calculations, two subgrid-scale (SS) models, a Smagorinsky SS model and a filtered dynamic SS model, were used. The numerical results from LES are in good agreement with the experimental data, in particular with the predicted airflow patterns and velocities around and within, and the surface pressures over, the models. This is considered to establish confidence {{in the application of}} the LES methods to the calculation of ventilation in buildings, in particular for single-sided ventilation cases...|$|E
