In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{traditions are}} passed down through {{language}}, making language {{an important factor}} in the existence of biocultural diversity.

The <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Diversity</b> Index has recorded that between 1970 and 2005, the number of languages spoken globally has decreased by 20%. This decline has been especially observed in indigenous languages, with a 60% decline in the Americas, 30% in the Pacific, and 20% in Africa. Currently, there are 7,000 languages being spoken in the world. Half the population speaks only 25 of these languages, the top 5 in order being Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi, and Bengali. The remaining 6975 languages are divided between the other half of the population.|$|E

Today, the Swabian, Bavarian, Saxon and Cologne dialects in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% mutually intelligible with modern Standard German, meaning that in a conversation between a native speaker of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will be able to understand slightly less than half of what is being said without any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding its {{significance}} as a communicative apparatus for social interaction, the general mechanism of politeness {{has been less}} clear partly because {{a wide variety of}} realization patterns of politeness strategies exist across cultures and languages. Researchers who are sensitive to the cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>diversities</b> of communication styles have claimed that politeness varies in its conceptualization and practices across cultures and languages, whereas linguists in pragmatics have assumed that politeness is a part of a universally rational communication system that operates in the same way for any language user. This study attempts to investigate the universal mechanism of politeness presumably built into any language system. At the same time, potential cross-cultural differences in values assigned to politeness are explored to determine what interferes with people's universal competence in perceiving politeness. In comparing native and nonnative speakers of English, people's judgments of politeness and other notions closely related to politeness were assessed for several speech act types in English.

25|$|As {{long ago}} as Biblical times, {{cultural}} and linguistic differences between Jewish communities, even within the area of Ancient Israel and Judea, are observed both within the Bible itself {{as well as from}} archeological remains. In more recent human history, an array of Jewish communities were established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long-term isolation from each other. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments; political, cultural, natural and populational. Today, manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish <b>linguistic</b> <b>diversity,</b> culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.|$|E
25|$|The <b>linguistic</b> <b>diversity</b> among Chinese Singaporeans varies {{according}} to age group. Most young Chinese Singaporeans speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, or Hainanese. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain upward social mobility. Many of the young Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently. This applies equally even to the more westernised Chinese Christian community, who prefers the English language over any other. This (the Hokkien dialect) apparently {{seems to be the}} only struggling force against the loss of Chinese cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Tibeto-Burman, {{one finds}} in Arunachal Pradesh a single {{representative}} of the Tai family, spoken by tribes like the Khampti and Singpho, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar's Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar. In addition to these non-Indo-European languages, the Indo-European languages Assamese, Bengali, English, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily {{as a result of}} the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolized variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state.

25|$|There are {{approximately}} 296 spoken (or formerly spoken) indigenous languages north of Mexico, 269 {{of which are}} grouped into 29 families (the remaining 27 languages are either isolates or unclassified). The Na-Dené, Algic, and Uto-Aztecan families are the largest in terms of number of languages. Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95 million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5 million speakers of Nahuatl); Na-Dené comes in second with approximately 200,000 speakers (nearly 180,000 of these are speakers of Navajo), and Algic in third with about 180,000 speakers (mainly Cree and Ojibwe). Na-Dené and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada {{across much of the}} continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the Kickapoo) with two outliers in California (Yurok and Wiyot); Na-Dené spans from Alaska and western Canada through Washington, Oregon, and California to the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great <b>linguistic</b> <b>diversity</b> present in North America. Two large (super-) family proposals, Penutian and Hokan, look particularly promising. However, even after decades of research, a large number of families remain.|$|E
