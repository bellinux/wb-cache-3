5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> made it useful since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol subsisted upon a maize-based diet; maize {{was mostly}} {{consumed}} in <b>liquid</b> <b>form,</b> {{such as in}} posole, and was probably eaten as tamales. The Manche diet also included beans, chilli, sweet potato and turkey. Plantain and sugar cane {{were introduced to the}} Manche after European contact.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup {{continues}} to be produced today. It is a commercial, mass-produced product that is marketed and purveyed to consumers, and remains available in the United Kingdom. The company was founded in 1830. It is prepared in a <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> and has a dark brown coloration. Contemporary preparation of Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup consists mostly of water, salt, vinegar, and hydrolised vegetable protein, containing just 3% mushroom powder.|$|E
5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{nonmetallic}} {{character of}} selenium {{is shown by}} its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or {{less than that of}} bromine (7.95S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in <b>liquid</b> <b>form.</b> It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in <b>liquid</b> <b>form,</b> which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E

25|$|Vapor {{condensation}} is {{the most}} effective off-gas treatment technology for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> where it is collected in steel containers. The <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology).|$|E
25|$|In a cool, dry place, oils {{have greater}} stability, but may thicken, {{although}} they will soon return to <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> {{if they are}} left at room temperature.
