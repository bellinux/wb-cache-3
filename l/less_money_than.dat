5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{avalanche}} at San Carlos Minas in January 1992, Hermética joined a charity music festival {{held at the}} Chateau Carreras stadium. Hermética played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Hermética were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the band for playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Motörhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> had been agreed. Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.|$|E

25|$|A {{successor}} to the ZR-1 made its debut in 2001 as the Z06, giving {{a nod to the}} high-performance Z06 version of the C2 Corvette of the 1960s. Instead of a heavy, double-overhead cam engine like in the ZR-1, the Z06 used a high-output, tuned version of the standard LS1 Corvette engine (designated LS6), which initially produced 385hp (287kW). Although its total horsepower output was less than that of the last ZR-1, the Z06 was much lighter, and could out-perform the ZR-1 in every category except top speed. It also cost substantially <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> the ZR-1. The Z06 curb weight totaled 3,118lbs.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law {{extended}} {{the statute of}} limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman {{at the end of her}} career found that she had been making <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{increasing}} number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> she had once been accustomed to.

Bunten wrote in her Life of Alice Barnham that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill. He subsequently rewrote his will, which had previously been very generousleaving her lands, goods, and incomeand instead revoked it all.|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} and empirical {{shift from the}} study of the kinds of consumption facilitated by credit, to the processes and performances in consuming credit itself, opens up an array of questions for the social study of money and markets. Consuming credit relies on infrastructures of credit's creation and transmission, which in turn leave data trails in their wake. Both the infrastructures and the data suggest new business models and pose challenges to social studies of financialization because of their decidedly non-market characteristics.

25|$|Butkus {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} by both the Denver Broncos of the American Football League and the Chicago Bears of the National Football League. After several days of {{recruiting}} by both the teams and leagues, his decision to sign with the Bears was viewed as a major victory for the NFL. Although the Bears offered him <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> did the Broncos, playing for his hometown team and coach George Halas was more enticing. His rookie contract was worth $200,000. Along with fellow future Hall of Famer Gale Sayers, Butkus was one of three first-round picks for the Bears in the 1965 NFL Draft. The pick they used for Butkus had been acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{following the}} crash, especially regarding {{the failure of}} the pilot to respond to crew concerns about the deicing procedure, led to a number of reforms in pilot training regulations. Partial blame was placed on the young, inexperienced flight crew, who had a combined age of only 65 and had begun their careers as commercial pilots less than five years earlier. Typical of upstart low-cost carriers, Air Florida frequently hired youthful pilots who worked for <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> veterans and were for the most part seeking to gain flight experience prior to joining a major airline. It became a widely used case study for both air crews and rescue workers. Another result of the accident was the development of an improved rescue harness for use in helicopter recoveries.|$|E
25|$|While Heath/Zenith's {{computer}} {{business was}} successful, {{the growing popularity}} of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. While their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products; BYTE reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to surface mount components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.|$|E
50|$|Charter {{school funding}} is {{dictated}} by each state. In many states, charter schools are funded by transferring per-pupil state {{aid from the}} school district where the charter school student resides. Charters on average receive <b>less</b> <b>money</b> per-pupil <b>than</b> the corresponding public schools in their areas, though the average figure is controversial because some charter schools do not enroll a proportionate number of students that require special education or student support services. Additionally, some charters {{are not required to}} provide transportation and nutrition services.The Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Part B, Sections 502-511 authorizes funding grants for charter schools.|$|R

500|$|Lacking a {{contract}} {{prior to the}} 1995–96 season, Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take <b>less</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> he could have received {{on the open market}} out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity. He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener. Although he felt like somebody was [...] "stabbing a knife in [...] gut every five minutes", Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it.

Upper-class status commonly derived from the social position of one's family and not from one's own achievements or wealth. Much of the population that comprised the upper class consisted of aristocrats, ruling families, titled people, and religious hierarchs. These people were usually born into their status, and historically, there was not much movement across class boundaries.
