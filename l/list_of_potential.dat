5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement bus rapid transit along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E
5|$|In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for {{the first}} time since his {{deportation}} fifteen years before. In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election Boris Yeltsin's campaign team included Bukovsky on their <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979–1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the Soviet Union was selected. On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky's Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court. The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovsky's Russian citizenship: he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship, despite deportation from the country.|$|E

Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company.

5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

5|$|The marine {{engineer}} and amateur historian Anders Franzén had searched for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located Vasa in 1956. Kronan {{was one of}} several famous shipwrecks on a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to Kronan were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a sidescan sonar and a magnometer, an instrument that detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of Kronan.|$|E
5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel methodology, PRO_SELECT, which combines elements of structure-based drug design and combinatorial chemistry {{to create a}} new paradigm for accelerated lead discovery. Starting with a synthetically accessible template positioned in the active site of the target of interest, PRO_SELECT employs database searching to generate <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> substituents for each substituent position on the template. These substituents are {{selected on the basis of}} their being able to couple to the template using known synthetic routes and their possession of the correct functionality to interact with specified residues in the active site. The <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> substituents are then screened computationally against the active site using rapid algorithms. An empirical scoring function, correlated to binding free energy, is used to rank the substituents at each position. The highest scoring substituents at each position can then be examined using a variety of technique...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEnvironmental issues {{involved}} by emerging markets and rapid development of goods' consumption require {{a new model}} to design product more sustainable. While traditional eco-design methods (LCA, Checklists, Guidelines, DfX tools…) are generally limited in local optimization of product or macro-rules for environmental strategy, this article presents an eco-innovative method consisting in: identifying three <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> Use-cycles Scenarios (pUS) (SADT activity A 2), three <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> Products Architectures (pPA) (A 3) and three <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> Reverse-supply-chain Structures (pRS) (A 4), associating pUS, pPA and pRS to form viable concepts of product evaluating these concepts by {{the way of a}} multi-criteria approach: environmentally friendly, economically viable for companies and attractive for users and stakeholders. The purpose is to help the design team to develop various levels of change from existing product concept (Use cycles + Product + RSC) : optimized, improved and innovative. Every concept is established by separating at first Architectures produced and structure RSC. In the first time information necessary for the project is collected (current products, current RSC and current usage). An identification of the new usage provides on one hand the Product design stage {{and on the other hand}} the RSC structure construction stage. The best Architectures and structures are finally associated then assessed environmentally, economically as well as the attractiveness of the customers and the actors of the system in order to select the most successful concepts...|$|R

25|$|The Classical Revival {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Nathan C. Wyeth, an architect {{in private practice in}} the city, and Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. The legislation authorizing the bridge's construction required that the United States Department of War consult with the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) {{in the design of the}} bridge. Subsequently, the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers asked the CFA for a list of architects whom the CFA believed would be competent to design an aesthetically pleasing bridge. The CFA swiftly provided a list, and in July 1916 Tyler met with the CFA to discuss a short <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> architects. The CFA and Tyler also conferred on the bridge's orientation, design, and approaches. Tyler selected Wyeth. The plans were nearly complete by September. Wyeth and Tyler's initial design for the bridge was a double-deck structure with a single, high span. But with World War I erupting in Europe, inflation made this structure too costly. Wyeth then submitted a design for a single-deck, single-span bridge on January 12, 1917. The CFA asked Wyeth to design a multi-span bridge, or, failing that, to construct non-structural decorative elements that would make it look as if the bridge had multiple spans. Wyeth agreed, and the CFA approved the bridge design.|$|E
