Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular <b>look</b> of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural <b>look</b> of the Hebrews and their related environments. The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts.
