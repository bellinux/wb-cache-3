5|$|Leeboard: To avoid leeward drift {{caused by}} the force of wind while sailing, the <b>leeboard</b> was invented; it was a board lowered onto the side of the ship {{opposite}} to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and on course. Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on a bronze drum of the Dong Son culture (centered in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam) may depict a <b>leeboard</b> in use as early as 300 BC. Leeboards may have been invented in China as early as the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the Borobudur monument built during the Sailendra dynasty of Central Java (Indonesia). Leeboards were first used in the West by the Dutch, during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch cogs, or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin).|$|E
25|$|A sharp {{bottom and}} {{prominent}} keel create a “wine glass” shaped hull {{with a large}} <b>leeboard.</b> A strongly curved hull profile {{and the depth of}} the keel prevented the ship from drifting, enabling it to sail windward. This hull design is characterized by a reverse stempost with a cutwater, enabling the vessel to compensate for its large, non-specialized, powerful square sails and giving it speed.|$|E
50|$|The Naples Sabot {{differs from}} the MacGregor in its use of a <b>leeboard</b> instead of a daggerboard. The <b>leeboard</b> gives the boat {{additional}} versatility, {{making it easy to}} use as a rowboat and thus permitting it {{to be used as a}} tender or for fishing. Along with the <b>leeboard</b> the boat gained a small fixed keel, which assists when rowing or towing the dinghy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leeboards</b> {{existed in}} China {{from at least}} the eighth century on {{warships}} that [...] "held the ships, so that even when wind and wave arise in fury, they are neither driven sideways, nor overturn". <b>Leeboards</b> used to stabilize the junk and to improve its capability to sail upwind, are documented from a book by Li Chuan. The innovation was transmitted to Portuguese and Dutch ships around 1570. [...] "The Portuguese experimented with caulking their vessels in the Chinese manner and the Dutch probably added <b>leeboards</b> to their craft that were copied from Chinese models." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Leeboards</b> {{have been}} used by {{relatively}} large inshore sailing vessels used for transport since 1570, such as Dutch barges and Thames barges. For these boats, <b>leeboards</b> provided the advantages of shallow draught for working close inshore and an unobstructed hold for cargo. They were also easier to build than a large centreboard would have been.|$|R

50|$|According to {{traditional}} design principles, a boat utilizing a <b>leeboard</b> either {{needs to have}} two retractable leeboards, one on each side, or a method of removing the <b>leeboard</b> and attaching it to either side while under way, because nearly all sailboats tack {{to work their way}} upwind (with the exception of the proa). However, some small sailboat designers claim to have created seaworthy vessels with only a single, fixed <b>leeboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>leeboard</b> is a lifting foil {{used by a}} sailboat, {{much like}} a centreboard, but located on the leeward side of the boat. The leeward side is used so that the <b>leeboard</b> is not lifted from the water when the boat heels, or leans under {{the force of the}} wind.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leeboards</b> are {{no longer}} common in commercially-built boats, because many people {{consider}} them inelegant and awkward. They are far more common in home-built boats, especially the Puddle Duck Racer and stitch and glue type sailboats. <b>Leeboards</b> simplify construction of the hull, as they {{are attached to the}} outside and do not require holes in the hull, which can leak. Since centreboards are retractable, they require a large, watertight trunk to hold them in place when retracted, and this occupies what otherwise might be useful space in the cabin or cockpit of the boat. Use of <b>leeboards,</b> while it adds complexity to the process of tacking, leaves the floor of the boat unobstructed.|$|R
5000|$|A galiot was {{a type of}} Dutch or German 20 to 400 GRT trade ship, {{similar to}} a ketch, with a rounded fore and aft like a fluyt. They had nearly flat bottoms to sail in shallow waters. These ships were {{especially}} favored for coastal navigation in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. To avoid excessive leeway, or leeward drift due to their flat bottoms, smaller vessels were usually fitted with <b>leeboards.</b> After 1830, a modernised type of galiot was developed that featured a sharper bow similar to a schooner. These vessels rarely had <b>leeboards.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{said that}} the Ma'anyan people arrived and settled on Madagascar island in 945 to 946 AD, sailing through the Indian Ocean on 1,000 <b>leeboard</b> sailboats. Based on {{historical}} facts, every stone relief in Borobudur tells of the Malay archipelago conditions during the peak of Buddhism period. Interestingly, the Srivijayan, Nan Sarunai and Majapahit kingdom had used the <b>leeboard</b> sailboats throughout its history. It is known that the Srivijaya kingdom did expand its empire covering West Java, part of Central Java and the desperate Empu Sendok from Medang Kingdom which was about to reach East Java in 929 to 947 AD. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} scholars and artisans of that time period recorded the events of the Ma'anyan people evacuating in large numbers on <b>leeboard</b> sailboats in 945 to 946 AD on the stone reliefs of Borobudur.|$|E
50|$|A Bruce foil is {{a variant}} of the <b>leeboard,</b> {{consisting}} of a foil typically mounted on an outrigger and always set at an angle to provide both lateral and vertical force. It was invented by Edmond Bruce in the early 1960s, and first published in the Amateur Yacht Research Society publication in April 1965.|$|E
50|$|It is {{produced}} {{with either a}} bilge keel or twin <b>leeboards.</b> The bilge keel produces an angle of vanishing stability of 121°. A single lifting fin keel system is being designed.|$|R
2500|$|They were steered using [...] long quarter oars, {{with the}} seconda nave {{equipped}} with four, two off each quarter and {{two from the}} shoulders while the prima nave was equipped with two. Similar pairs of steering <b>leeboards</b> appear frequently in early 2nd century depictions of ships.|$|R
50|$|In good conditions, sailing barges could attain {{speeds of}} over 12 knots, and their <b>leeboards</b> {{allowed them to}} be highly {{effective}} windward performers. The unusual sprits'l rig allowed any combination of sails to be set: even the topsail on its own could be effective in some conditions.|$|R

50|$|A bilgeboard is a lifting foil {{used in a}} sailboat, which {{resembles a}} cross between a {{centerboard}} and a <b>leeboard.</b> Bilgeboards are mounted between the centerline of the boat and the sides, and are almost always asymmetric foils mounted at an angle to maximize lateral lift while minimizing drag. They are most often found on racing scows.|$|E
50|$|A sharp {{bottom and}} {{prominent}} keel create a “wine glass” shaped hull {{with a large}} <b>leeboard.</b> A strongly curved hull profile {{and the depth of}} the keel prevented the ship from drifting, enabling it to sail windward.

50|$|Racing {{dinghies}} {{usually have}} a daggerboard or centreboard to better sail upwind. The trunk {{is in the middle}} of what would otherwise be cargo area. A self-rescue dinghy intended to be used as a proactive lifeboat has <b>leeboards</b> on either side, to allow for maximum open cockpit area.|$|R
50|$|A keelboat is a {{riverine}} cargo-capable working boat, or a small- to mid-sized recreational sailing yacht. The {{boats in}} the first category have shallow structural keels, and are nearly flat-bottomed and often used <b>leeboards</b> if forced in open water, while modern recreational keelboats have prominent fixed fin keels, and considerable draft. The two terms may draw from cognate words with different final meaning.|$|R
50|$|The main hull, or vaka, {{is usually}} {{longer than the}} {{windward}} hull, or ama. Crossbeams called akas connect the vaka to the ama. Traditional proa hulls are markedly asymmetrical along their length, and often curved {{in such a way}} as to produce lift to counteract the lateral forces of the wind. Modern proa hulls are often symmetrical, and use <b>leeboards</b> for lateral resistance.|$|R
50|$|On a {{traditional}} two-leeboard (or non-fixed <b>leeboard)</b> design, the boards are {{designed so that}} the windward board can be retracted, to reduce drag. Unlike centreboards, which are symmetric along the boat's axis, leeboards are often asymmetric, so that they more efficiently provide lift in one direction. Some fast racing scows use bilgeboards, which are mounted between the centreline of the hull and the sides, so they can use a pair of asymmetric foils for maximum lift and minimum drag.|$|E
5000|$|An {{innovation}} that improved the sail's performance was the beitass, or stretching pole [...] - [...] a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward {{performance of the}} ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or <b>leeboard.</b> To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about 500 to 700 mm long {{on the outside of}} the hull.|$|E
50|$|The most {{advanced}} ama {{are composed of}} highly curved surfaces which generate lift when driven forward through the water, much like an airplane wing. This lift may be directed to the windward, used to counter slipping to leeward, or may be oriented vertically to counter heeling forces from the sailing rig. These highly curved structures are {{much more difficult to}} manufacture than traditional ama, and are therefore more expensive. The Bruce foil {{is an example of a}} type of <b>leeboard</b> often attached to an ama to assist in producing lift.|$|E
50|$|As a {{development}} class, the PD Racer specifications allow for builders {{to experiment with}} different configurations. The PD Racer specifications only apply to the hull, allowing for various types of sailing rigs, and either <b>leeboards</b> or centreboards. Although the boats are required to conform to a specific shape for use in class racing, the hull {{can also be used}} for recreational sailing, paddling, and motoring.|$|R
50|$|A typical schuyt at {{the turn}} of the 20th century was {{described}} as having a large rudder which could be raised by an arrangement of blocks and tackles and a pair of <b>leeboards.</b> Schyuts engaged in eel fishing were said to have begun visiting London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and were granted the use of a berth there, which continued in use until the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Inflatable sailboats are a {{small but}} growing niche in the {{recreational}} market. Sail rigs are now offered for inflatable dinghies, kayaks and catamarans. In keeping with the portability of the inflatable hull, the components of the sail attachment fold or come apart to fit in a compact bundle. <b>Leeboards</b> on the sides perform the same function as a centerboard, to enable these boats to tack into the wind.|$|R
5000|$|A {{daggerboard}} is {{a removable}} vertical keel that is inserted through a [...] "trunk" [...] {{in the center}} of a vessel's hull, usually amidships. Daggerboards are usually found in small sailing craft such as day sailers, which are easily handled by a single person. Daggerboards are not usually ballasted but are locked in place by a clip or pin. Unlike a centreboard, which can be set at different angles to the hull of the boat, daggerboards are generally limited to a single perpendicular position relative to the hull. If a daggerboard is located off center, it is called a <b>leeboard</b> or a bilgeboard.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantages}} over a typical centerboard or <b>leeboard</b> {{is that the}} Bruce foil allows the sails to remain nearly upright and keep {{the full force of}} the wind available to drive movement without the crew needing to move their weight. The main disadvantage is that the sails remain upright and keep the full force of the wind available, rather than depowering with increasing angle of heel as happens with traditional foils. The Bruce foil also produces increased drag {{as a result of the}} vertical component of force, as well as a yawing force due to the off-center placement of the foil, which may require alteration of the steering system to compensate.|$|E
50|$|Bolger championed leeboards as low-tech and practical, to {{the chagrin}} of many yachties. The {{conventional}} wisdom is that they are ugly. Even many of his centerboard designs had boards that were off-center or all the way to {{one side or the other}} (for example, the Birdwatcher and the AS29). He concluded that a single <b>leeboard</b> is sufficient in many cases on small boats, and that rigs could be stepped off the centerline without much effect on performance. Bolger advocated leeboards as being a simple means of providing lateral plane to all types of sailing vessel, eliminating many of the disadvantages of centerboards, daggerboards and keels, following broadly in the concepts of L. Francis Herreshoff, various years his senior and, as stated by Bolger, one of the most influential yacht designers from his perspective.|$|E
5000|$|Reaching Makassar, MacKinnie and {{his company}} found few trade goods in the main city, because it was {{blockaded}} on both land and sea, which Dougal had anticipated would be the case, giving the company an excuse to travel to Batav, the city where the First Empire library/temple was located. MacKinnie, {{with the help of}} a former Haven Navy commander in his company, bought and refitted a sailing ship with <b>leeboards.</b> (Although a primitive technology to Imperials, <b>leeboards</b> were an advanced one in Makassar terms (which the Imperials failed to appreciate) that would allow their ship to travel much faster than any other on the planet.) MacKinnie's ship then outran most of the blockading pirate ships and soon arrived in Batav, which was under the control of [...] "temple" [...] high priests who were themselves besieged by vast hordes of barbarian horsemen. There were also Second Empire missionaries stranded in Batav, who believed that the Traders allowed them to travel to Batav because the killing of Imperial missionaries would provide a pretext for Imperial intervention on Makassar.|$|R
50|$|Although his designs ranged {{through the}} full {{spectrum}} of boat types, Bolger tended to favor simplicity over complexity. Many of his hulls are made from sheet materials — typically plywood — and have hard chines. A subclass of these designed in association with Harold Payson called Instant Boats were so named because they were intended to be easily built by amateurs out of commonly available materials. Bolger also advocated the use of traditional sailing rigs and <b>leeboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pocket cruisers {{range in}} length from 10 to about 26 ft, with some variation, {{depending}} on individual requirements. Most {{are in the}} range of 15 to 20 ft long, with a beam around 6 ft. Commercial models generally have either a short, ballasted shoal draft keel or a weighted centerboard, while home-built designs often use water ballast and <b>leeboards.</b> The short length and low weight of most pocket cruisers (and short keels on models with fixed keels) allow them to be trailered easily.|$|R
