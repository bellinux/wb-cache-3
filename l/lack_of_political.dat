5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|The {{weaknesses}} of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late {{to ensure that the}} VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše but also from the country's Slovene and ethnic German minorities.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, criticisms {{have been}} made {{on the way the}} {{operation}} was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consistent <b>political</b> guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> clear <b>political</b> guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues.|$|R
5|$|The {{weaknesses}} of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree {{by the lack of}} unity across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony, and the attendant <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the lack of unity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše, but also from the Slovene and ethnic German minorities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Udin {{was born}} on 18 February 1963, a date {{considered}} unlucky in the Javanese calendar as it fell on a kliwon Monday. His father was Wagiman Dzuchoti, a mosque watchman, {{and his mother was}} Mujiah; Udin had five siblings. As a young man, Udin had wanted to join the Indonesian military, but was unable due to his family's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> connections. Instead, he worked various manual labour jobs, including stonemason.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take {{a greater role in}} Virginia society.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire is Captain James Cutter (Gregg Berger), a strong leader who has earned the admiration of his subordinates. Cutter's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> ambition prevents him from climbing the ranks further. Serving under Cutter is Sergeant John Forge (Nolan North), a gruff Marine whose devotion to men has caused him to be jailed twice for disobeying orders and engaging in disorderly conduct. Joining the Spirit of Fires military expedition is Professor Ellen Anders (Kim Mai Guest), a scientist interested in ancient ruins of the mysterious Forerunners. The Spirit of Fire is operated with help from Serina (Courtenay Taylor), a super-intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) with a sardonic sense of humor; it has been noted that she demonstrates a level of contempt for the humans she assists. Leading the Covenant search for Forerunner technology is a holy warrior known as the Arbiter (David Sobolov), who the Covenant leaders, the Prophet Hierarchs, have tasked with the oversight of humanity's destruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} of the LAF is outdated due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> funds, <b>political</b> bickering {{and until}} the 2000s, the presence of foreign forces. The Lebanese government is working with its partners to improve the armed forces' capabilities.|$|R

50|$|Legal {{commentators}} such as Schmidt and Follesdal {{argue that}} the European Union lacks politics that individual citizens understand.

50|$|<b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> open <b>political</b> debate or an {{informed}} electorate. The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> the press, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> objectivity {{in the press}} due to state control, or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> access to news and <b>political</b> media. Freedom <b>of</b> speech may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state propaganda.|$|R

25|$|This had {{not been}} the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the Queens-Midtown Tunnel was being planned. He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> support.|$|E

The Commission considered several options other than independence, but decided that they were [...] "impractical, unrealistic or impossible."

30|$|Christa Rottensteiner has noted, “the primary {{responsibility}} for {{meeting the needs of}} the civilian population in an armed conflict rests with the warring parties that are in effective control of the territory on which that population lives” (Rottensteiner 1999). As the international legal framework does not currently envisage NSAGs as obligation-holders, and in light <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>political</b> will to alter this, extra-legal efforts are necessary to bring NSAGs’ conduct in line with human rights standards and alleviate humanitarian crises caused by NIAC.|$|R

25|$|Starting in the 1970s, Chinese {{nationalist}} {{dominance of}} the government began to recede. This was due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a <b>political</b> or social theory that would justify continued Chinese nationalist dominance, meritocratic policies which allowed local Taiwanese to move up in the political establishment, and economic prosperity which allowed for social mobility for those outside <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> establishment.|$|R
