Methods: District-level data on JE cases were examined using Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify spatial clusters from 2004 to 2008 and 2005 data was used to fit a spatial <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> model with climate, agriculture and land-cover variables. Results: Prior to 2006, there was a single large cluster of JE cases located in the Far-West and Mid-West terai regions of Nepal. After 2005, the distribution of JE cases in Nepal shifted with clusters found in the central hill areas. JE incidence during the 2005 epidemic had a stronger association with May mean monthly temperature and April mean monthly total precipitation compared to mean annual temperature and precipitation.

40|$|Order {{selection}} {{based on}} criteria by Akaike (1974), AIC, Schwarz (1978), BIC or Hannan and Quinn (1979) HIC is often applied in empirical examples. They {{have been used}} in the context of order selection of weakly dependent ARMA models, AR models with unit or explosive roots and in the context of regression or distributed <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> models for weakly dependent data. On the other hand, it has been observed that data exhibits the so-called strong dependence in many areas. Because of the interest in this type of data, our main objective in this paper is to examine order selection for a distributed <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> model that covers in a unified form weak and strong dependence. To that end, and because of the possible adverse properties of the aforementioned criteria, we propose a criterion function based on the decomposition of the variance of the innovations of the model in terms of their frequency components. Assuming that the order of the model is finite, say po, we show that the proposed criterion consistently estimates, po. In addition, we show that adaptive estimation for the parameters of the model is possible without knowledge of po. Finally, a small Monte-Carlo experiment is included to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed criterion. Order selection, distributed lag models, strong dependence. ...|$|E

Few studies have evaluated the public health utility of sentinel programmes using geo-analytic approaches. Confirmed Lyme disease cases diagnosed by physicians and ticks submitted by veterinarians to the West Virginia State Health Department were obtained for 2014 - 2016. Ticks were identified to species, and only Ixodes scapularis were incorporated in the analysis. Separate ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> models were conducted to estimate the association between average numbers of Ix. scapularis collected on pets and human Lyme disease incidence. Regression residuals were visualised using Local Moran’s I as a diagnostic tool to identify spatial dependence. Statistically significant associations were identified between average numbers of Ix. scapularis collected from dogs and human Lyme disease in the OLS (β= 20. 7, P< 0. 001) and spatial lag (β= 12. 0, P= 0. 002) regression. No significant associations were identified for cats in either regression model. Statistically significant (P≤ 0. 05) spatial dependence was identified in all regression models. Local Moran’s I maps produced for spatial <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> residuals indicated a decrease in model over- and under-estimation, but identified a higher number of statistically significant outliers than OLS regression. Results support previous conclusions that dogs are effective sentinel populations for monitoring risk of human exposure to Lyme disease.

The first case uses standard anthropogenic and volcanic external radiative forcings. The second adds non-radiative internal forcing (ocean mixing changes initiated {{in the top}} 200 m) proportional to the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) to represent an internal mode of natural variability. The third case further adds ENSO-related radiative forcing proportional to MEI as a possible natural cloud forcing mechanism associated with atmospheric circulation changes. The model adjustable parameters are net radiative feedback, effective diffusivities, and internal radiative (e. g., cloud) and non-radiative (ocean mixing) forcing coefficients at adjustable time lags.

The lifecycles of the baroclinic anomalies, estimated {{by means of}} <b>lagged</b> <b>regression</b> analysis, are qualitatively different depending on the frequency range. At high frequency, the zonal-mean baroclinicity simply responds to the fast eddy heat flux forcing.

The meridional eddy heat flux by planetary scale eddies also contributes to the low-frequency shift but the synoptic eddy heat flux behaves diffusively and damps the baroclinicity anomalies at low frequency.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 The midwinter {{suppression}} of the Pacific storm track is described in detail based on NCEP Reanalysis data from 1979 to 2001. The midwinter suppression is characterized by an equatorward shift and overall decrease in storm track intensity, {{measured in terms of}} eddy total energy (TE), that occurs primarily above 500 mb over the western and central Pacific. The suppression is accompanied by an equatorward shift and overall strengthening of the Pacific jet and a lowering of the tropopause poleward of the jet; it occurs despite the midwinter maximum in baroclinicity. An eddy energy budget analysis is performed to examine the changes in the flow of eddy energy in baroclinic waves during midwinter. Changes in baroclinic wave structure reduce the efficiency of baroclinic generation of eddy available potential energy (APE); decreased moisture and increased static stability reduce the efficiency of baroclinic conversion of eddy APE to eddy kinetic energy (KE); and shallower baroclinic conversion reduces the fraction of eddy KE that persists at upper levels. These effects overcome the increase in baroclinicity in midwinter to reduce the eddy TE at upper levels relative to fall and spring. <b>Lag</b> <b>regression</b> analysis reveals that, in midwinter, temperature perturbations are shallower because of increased upper level static stability and have a larger eastward tilt with height because of the stronger Pacific jet. Shallowing of the temperature perturbations decreases the fraction of eddy KE that persists, and the shallowing and larger tilt both decrease the efficiency of baroclinic generation. The <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> analysis also shows that baroclinic waves tilt poleward with height in all seasons because of their ageostrophic wind structure. The combination of the effects of increased upper level static stability associated with the lowering of the tropopause causes most of the midwinter {{suppression of}} the Pacific storm track. Increased jet speed and decreased moisture make additional small contributions to the suppression. The poleward tilt with height of baroclinic waves places the maximum upper level eddy energy on the poleward side of the Pacific jet, where it is more efficiently suppressed by the lowering of the tropopause in midwinter...|$|E

However, views on the matter have largely been shaped by anecdotal evidence or results from analyses with insufficient controls. Making use of a dynamic fixed-effects distributed <b>lag</b> <b>regression</b> model, we empirically assess the role that two central components of pharmaceutical marketing practices (namely, detailing and sampling) have on physician prescribing behavior. Key differentiating features of our model include its ability to (i) capture persistence in the prescribing process and decompose it into own-growth and competitive-stealing effects, (ii) estimate an unrestricted decay structure of the promotional effects over time, and (iii) control for physician-specific effects that, if not taken into account, induce biased coefficient estimates of detailing and sampling effects. Based on pooled time series cross-sectional data involving three drugs, 24 monthly observations, and 74, 075 individual physicians (more than 2 million observations in total), we find that detailing and free drug samples have positive and statistically significant effects on the number of new prescriptions issued by a physician.

Despite its relevance, statistical procedures for measuring the significance of such estimators are undeveloped. We present methodology based on a functional central limit theorem for conducting statistical inference for the cross-covariance operator estimated between two stationary, weakly dependent, functional time series. Specifically, we consider testing the null hypothesis that two series possess a specified cross-covariance structure at a given lag. Since this test assumes that the series are jointly stationary, we also develop a change-point detection procedure to validate this assumption, which is of independent interest. The most imposing technical hurdle in implementing the proposed tests involves estimating the spectrum of a high dimensional spectral density operator at frequency zero. We propose a simple dimension reduction procedure based on functional PCA to achieve this, which is shown to perform well in a small simulation study. We illustrate the proposed methodology with an application to densely observed intraday price data of stocks listed on the NYSE...|$|R
40|$|We {{hear a lot}} of {{political}} declarations stating the importance of developing an innovation economy by fostering venture capital inflows. But {{it is obvious that the}} venture capital market makes an extremely low contribution in terms of total R&D spending or gross investment. Thus, theory says venture capital investment (VCI) is important due to its huge impact on modernization, but practitioners note that there is no evidence and VCI constitutes about 1 % of total investments. Formal logic foregrounds the thesis that the effect of venture investment is important and significant, but delayed. We contribute to the theory and discussion of the problem of choosing between venture and non-venture funding by determining a specific niche for venture capital investment. We derive <b>lagged</b> <b>regression</b> models for GDP and patent applications for the US and Russia, to test VCI’s impact on economic growth and innovation. Comparison of model estimates shows significant VCI influence on GDP at a 4 - 6 - year lag and no synchronous influence, valid for both the US and Russia. We prove the main hypothesis of our research: the effect of venture investment on economic and innovation development parameters is significant and much greater than that of ‘conventional’ investment...|$|R
