50|$|After his own beating, Shy obtains a gun {{and returns}} to the party to find Hammer. After firing the gun to clear out the party, he corners Hammer and {{explains}} what a mess Hammer has made of his own sister's <b>life.</b> <b>He</b> says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will spare Hammer's <b>life</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can watch the trouble <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has caused in Andrea's <b>life.</b> Hammer replies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would rather see Andrea become a whore than be with Shy.

5|$|The {{death of}} Chekhov's brother Nikolay from {{tuberculosis}} in 1889 influenced A Dreary Story, finished that September, {{about a man}} who confronts the end of a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> realises has been without purpose. Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolay's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Allardyce {{was born}} in October 1954 on the Old Park Farm Estate, Dudley, the son of Robert Allardyce (1916–1989) and Mary Agnes Allardyce (1918–1991). His father was a police sergeant. Both parents {{originated}} from Scotland with his father from Nairn and his mother from Dumfries. He has an older sister, Mary, born in Scotland in 1939 and an older brother, Robert junior, born in 1951. Allardyce was educated at Sycamore Green Primary School and later at Mons Hill School, having been unsuccessful in his Eleven plus exam. He discovered in later <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suffers from dyslexia. As a child, he supported Wolverhampton Wanderers and dreamed {{that one day he}} would play at and manage the club.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after {{three or four}} weeks. This {{was the last time}} in his <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a {{classical}} school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|His {{mother was}} of pure Spanish blood born in Mexico, and therefore, a criolla. Some sources state {{she came from}} a {{high-ranking}} family in Michoacán. In the Spanish colonial era, racial caste was important to advancement, including military rank, and having some indigenous ancestry was often a disadvantage.

50|$|Vermoelen {{was born}} in Antwerp, where he trained under Pieter Snyers. He became {{a master of the}} Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1733.

25|$|Eventually, a {{consortium}} of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman would write for Associated Newspapers, broadcast regularly on Radio 2UE and promote the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. The contract was substantially less than the money on offer from Accrington, and it would increase Bradman's dependence on his public profile, thus {{making it more difficult}} to lead the private <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> desired. In addition, writing for the newspapers would again bring him into conflict with the administrators.|$|E
25|$|Spybuck told Harrington that he {{preferred}} painting cowboys, livestock, and range scenes, but through Harrington's patronage, Spybuck's style evolved, particularly in {{his choice of}} subjects {{and the way he}} painted them. His style was naïve and representational, featuring local scenes of ceremonies, games, social gatherings, and home <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was familiar with and often participated in. His style recalled Plains flatstyle representative art that often identified individuals by depicting details of dress and accoutrement, but he took the representational depiction of the figures and setting in a new direction that was uniquely his own.|$|E
25|$|When Trotsky was eight, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Odessa to be educated in a Jewish school. He was {{enrolled}} in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa {{as a result of the}} Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook. Although Trotsky said in his autobiography My <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.|$|E
