These alternative systems and concepts are enabled by recent and envisaged advancements in electronics, communications, computing and "Designer Fluid Mechanics" {{in conjunction with}} a design approach employing extensive synergistic interactions between propulsion, aerodynamics and structures. INTRODUCTION The last 50 years of aeronautics have been truly revolutionary. In much of the developed world, train and ship <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> has been replaced by aviation and aviation has assumed a dominant role in warfare. The list of revolutionary technological developments during this period includes large swept wing near-sonic transports of the 707 genre, supersonic cruise and fighter aircraft, turbojets and ramjets, high strength a [...] ...|$|R

This paper describes {{the concept of a}} multi haul DWDM platform combining traditional <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> with ultra <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> system features. A cost comparison of a typical national ring network shows that a multi haul platform provides a solution at a competitive cost to traditional <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> systems for low traffic levels and a low incremental upgrade cost advantage typical of an ultra <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> system. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The TRC-97 can be {{connected}} {{to one of three}} mobile antennas, depending on the distance and signal strength needed. One such antenna that can be used with the TRC-97 is the MRT-2 parabolic tropospheric antenna, measuring 15 feet across, which is designed to cover distances of up to 160 km, or 96 miles. Another antenna was a simple feed horn type mounted on a 30 ft pole. The third is a set of 8 foot parabolic dishes on 15' masts (pictured in the photo). These antennas are transported on trailers and have to be manually erected every time they are used, so knowledge of mechanics as well as electronics was needed to erect and maintain that equipment. The system was powered by a 3-cylinder diesel or later by a turbine generator (TG). a typical crew would consist of 2 or three wideband (airforce) technicians and 1 power production (airforce) technician to service the generator set. two units could be used back to back to provide a relay capability for extra <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>traffic.</b> this was usually done at the baseband level without need of any other equipment other than cables. it also could be remotely monitored from up to 2 miles away using the BZ109 test and monitor set. this was accomplished by connecting a single pair of field wires (common military phone line [...] ). th BZ109 would provide remote order wire, some basic measurements and alarm monitoring.|$|E
40|$|Several overlay-based live {{multimedia}} streaming platforms {{have been}} proposed in the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the overlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However, this causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying physical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary distances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data transmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should resemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the proximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based clustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust overlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of content pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven mesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to carry the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> and less stable nodes with intermittent presence are organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery procedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good locality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead induced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal {{as demonstrated by the}} analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We present {{structural}} {{results on}} optimal number of clusters and optimal rate {{with respect to}} <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance in a cluster based cooperative multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) sensor network. Using the concepts of super and sub modular functions and their associated properties it has been proved {{that the number of}} clusters to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance. From this, we conclude that as the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance increases the cooperation among the nodes increases to counter the path loss due to fading in the channel. Furthermore, we also prove the rate to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance. Finally, through our numerical results we observe that optimizing node cooperation can lead to large scale energy savings. I...|$|R
