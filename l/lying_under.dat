However, <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> oath, invoking God's name for magical purposes, or voicing words of hatred or defiance against God are considered sins of blasphemy.|$|E
5|$|During the cease-fire, {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, {{but it is too}} late. He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey, and finds himself <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in his hand and with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap. A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm. The chancel contains a monument to Rev.Edward Shipton, rector of the church from 1625 to 1630.|$|E

Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> oath.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{immediately}} clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant {{walked back to}} the café and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. He walked up to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three. He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> her husband. Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man, but the rifle's magazine was empty. Bryant then quickly moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{monument}} is {{more than}} 2 metres high, and it was mentioned {{for the first time}} in the 17th century during the national revision of historic monuments. It was at the time <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> the stone bridge that crossed the river north of Ekilla. It would remain lying there until 1860, when it was moved with great difficulty by Richard Dybeck. After one failed attempt a crew of 12 men managed to move it out of the water and raise it 25 metres north of the bridge, where it still remains. Next to it, there are two barrows and a monument of raised stones. There were formerly two other runestones at the bridge, but they were moved to Ekolsund in the early 19th century. One of them speaks of the same family as U 644, and it is raised after Andvéttr and his sons Gunnleifr and Kárr (one of the sons has the same name as his grandfather and the other one has the same name as his uncle).|$|E

Mild acne is classically defined {{by the presence of}} clogged skin follicles (known as comedones) limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions. Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face compared to mild cases of acne and are found on the trunk of the body. Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful 'bumps' <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions and involvement of the trunk is extensive.|$|E

500|$|Duncan in fact {{believes}} that the Battle of the Seven Sleepers did not lead directly to a change of leadership in the Kingdom of Scotland. It {{has been suggested that}} the chief consequence of Siward's expedition was not the overthrow of Mac Bethad, but the transfer of British territory—perhaps previously <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> Scottish suzerainty—to Northumbrian overlordship. Alex Woolf has posited that, in such a context, Máel Coluim might have been a discontented Cumbrian prince who had been forced to [...] "put himself under English protection". Evidence for Northumbrian control of Strathclyde in this period includes 11th-century Northumbrian masonry found at the site of Glasgow Cathedral as well as early 12th-century claims from the archbishopric of York that Archbishop Cynesige (1051–1060) had consecrated two Bishops of Glasgow.|$|E

500|$|Menkauhor's sun {{temple was}} called Akhet-Ra, which is {{variously}} translated as [...] "The Horizon of Ra" [...] or [...] "The Place where Ra Issues Forth". The temple {{has yet to}} be located and could be <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> the sands of Saqqara or Abusir. Its existence is known thanks to inscriptions found in the tombs of Fifth and Sixth Dynasties officials who served as priests of Ra in the temple. These include Hemu, buried in Giza, and Neferiretptah and Raemankh, who were both buried in Saqqara-north. In addition to his service in the Akhet-Ra, Neferiretptah was a priest in Menkauhor's pyramid and held the office of [...] "royal ornament", making him responsible for the precious items in the palace of the king.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with {{the scene in}} which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically {{for the next ten}} months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he [...] "saw this roller-coaster, and... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this." [...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|E

Hollinwood, in pre-industrial times, was a moor or common [...] of Chadderton, but was largely incorporated into neighbouring Oldham following a court case in 1713. [...] In the mid-18th century a village emerged at Hollinwood along the common border of Oldham and Chadderton, and there were further exchanges of land at Hollinwood between Oldham Borough and Chadderton township in 1880. [...] "Chadderton (Detached)" [...] was, as its name implies, a detached area or exclave of Chadderton. <b>Lying</b> <b>under</b> Copster Hill in Oldham and including the area now known as Garden Suburb, its area was absorbed into neighbouring Oldham in 1880.|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{was sent}} to Rome in 1912, where he {{attended}} the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 (sources vary). He {{was active in the}} consecration and entrustment to Mary. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons. According to Kolbe, They placed the black standard of the [...] "Giordano Brunisti" [...] under the windows of the Vatican. On this standard the archangel, St. Michael, was depicted <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully. Soon afterward, Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary. So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee.|$|E
