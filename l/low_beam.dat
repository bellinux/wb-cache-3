25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the <b>low</b> <b>beam.</b> However, <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|E

Of interest were the effects for mounting heights between 0. 864 m (34 in) and 1. 372 m (54 in) - the range in which full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> are currently allowed, but reduced-power high beams are not. Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power high beams with that from full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power high beams as a function of increased mounting height. The analyses were based on photometric information from five high <b>beams</b> and 43 <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> from lamps manufactured for the United States market. They were performed for five following distances and three lateral offsets of the vehicles. The results indicate that allowing reduced-power high beams with mounting heights between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power high beams at a mounting height of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

For each performance aspect, typical geometric situations (points in space) were specified in terms of longitudinal, lateral, and vertical positions, and the corresponding visual angles {{from each of the}} two headlamps were calculated.

25|$|Adaptive Highbeam Assist is Mercedes-Benz' {{marketing}} {{name for}} a headlight control strategy that continuously automatically tailors the headlamp range so the beam just reaches other vehicles ahead, thus always ensuring maximum possible seeing range without glaring other road users.

25|$|Proponents of each {{headlamp}} system decry {{the other}} as inadequate and unsafe: US proponents of the SAE system claim that the ECE <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> cutoff gives short seeing distances and inadequate illumination for overhead road signs, while international proponents of the ECE system claim that the SAE system produces too much glare.

25|$|This {{pioneering}} setup {{gave way}} in 1958 {{to a system}} called 'GuideMatic' in reference to GM's Guide lighting division.

By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The photosensor for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of retro-reflective yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them to dim prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 15) This in-traffic study evaluated {{driving performance}} with and preference for HID <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> Subjects drove two identical luxury sedans. One vehicle {{was equipped with}} HID <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> {{and the other with}} tungsten-halogen <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> The main difference between the two beams was that the HID lamps provided more spread light. Driving performance was evaluated by analyzing steering frequencies. The hypothesis was that the wider beam pattern of the HID lamps would be beneficial by reducing the steering effort in the 0. 3 to 0. 6 Hz range, which has been used in previous studies as an index of steering-task difficulty. The main finding is that the wider HID beam pattern made lane maintenance less demanding, as measured by a reduction in the steering frequencies between 0. 3 and 0. 6 Hz. The implication is that HID headlamps may be beneficial to safety, because their wider beam pattern allows more of the limited information processing resources of drivers to be allocated to other tasks. When the subjects were not primed before driving {{to pay attention to the}} headlamps, they did not show, as a group, preference for either type of lamp. However, when they were told to pay attention to the headlamps, they overwhelmingly preferred the HID lamps...|$|R

50|$|Another {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Shamal are its numerous headlamps in individual housings: outer round Carello <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> of the then-new projector type, inner rectangular high beams, combined turn signals and position lamps in the bumper, and two pairs of square lights in the lower grille—fog lamps and driving lamps.|$|R
25|$|Within Europe, when {{driving a}} vehicle with right-traffic {{headlamps}} in a left-traffic country {{or vice versa}} for a limited time (as for example on vacation or in transit), it is a legal requirement to adjust the headlamps temporarily so that their wrong-side beam distribution does not dazzle oncoming drivers. This may be achieved by methods including adhering opaque decals or prismatic lenses to a designated part of the lens. Some projector-type headlamps {{can be made to}} produce a proper left- or right-traffic beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly. Many tungsten (pre-halogen) European-code headlamps made in France by Cibié, Marchal, and Ducellier could be adjusted to produce either a left- or a right-traffic <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> by means of a two-position bulb holder.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full high beam. Headlamps are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive high beam is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight range control.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} beam pattern and headlamp construction standards in use in the world: The ECE standard, which is allowed or required in virtually all industrialized countries except the United States, and the SAE standard that is mandatory only in the US. Japan formerly had bespoke lighting regulations similar to the US standards, but for {{the left side of}} the road. However, Japan now adheres to the ECE standard. The differences between the SAE and ECE headlamp standards are primarily in the amount of glare permitted toward other drivers on <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> (SAE permits much more glare), the minimum amount of light required to be thrown straight down the road (SAE requires more), and the specific locations within the beam at which minimum and maximum light levels are specified.|$|E
