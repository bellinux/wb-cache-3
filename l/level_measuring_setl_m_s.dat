40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework of}} a system for risk estimation and portfolio optimization based on stable distributions and the average value-at-risk risk measure. In contrast to normal distributions, stable distributions capture the fat tails and the asymmetric nature of real-world risk factor distributions. In addition, we make use of copulas, a generalization of overly restrictive linear correlation models, {{to account for the}} dependencies between risk factors during extreme events. Using superior models, VaR becomes a much more accurate measure of downside risk. More importantly Stable Expected Tail Loss (SETL) can be accurately calculated and used as a more informative risk measure. Along with being a superior risk <b>measure,</b> <b>SETL</b> enables an elegant approach to risk budgeting and portfolio optimization Finally, we mention alternative investment performance measurement tools...|$|R

40|$|Disturbance <b>levels</b> were <b>measured</b> in {{the test}} section of a Mach 5 {{blowdown}} jet using a constant-current, hot-wire anemometer and a pressure transducer. The disturbance <b>levels,</b> <b>measured</b> by the two instruments and normalized by local mean values, agreed within about 30 %, with the pitot data higher than the hot-wire data. The rms disturbance <b>levels</b> <b>measured</b> with the hot-wire anemometer and converted to pitot pressures using a quasi-steady flow analysis, were about two-thirds the <b>levels</b> <b>measured</b> with the pitot probe. The variation of the normalized rms disturbance levels with stagnation pressure indicated that transition occurred in the boundary layer on the nozzle wall and influenced the outputs of the instruments located at the exit of the nozzle when the total pressure was about 35 N/sq cm. Below this pressure the disturbance levels decreased markedly. At higher pressures the disturbances were predominantly aerodynamic noise generated by the turbulent boundary layer on the nozzle wall...|$|R
