500|$|Bánáthy informally {{recruited}} one patrol of boys, {{including his}} own sons, and took them to summer camp in 1957 to test his idea. John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, {{was working on the}} waterfront. [...] "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol," [...] Chiorini reported [...] "Béla <b>listened</b> <b>intently</b> as I presented and then he came up after and gave me some tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on." ...|$|E
500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they <b>listened</b> <b>intently,</b> in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E
