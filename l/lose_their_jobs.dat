5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights}} of Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|Roughly {{three years}} after the {{foundation}} stone laying ceremony, the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests. The Telugu Desam Party repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal. In addition, on 12 and 13 March, 20,000 AAI employees had conducted a strike against the closure of Begumpet Airport, {{as well as that of}} HAL Airport in Bangalore, fearing they would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, {{and there were}} certain political undertones to the actions, though lack of leadership meant that little came of it. By the 1870s, 60% of Wales was owned by 570 families, most of whom did no farming. Instead, they employed workers, who were forced to vote Tory or <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{extent to}} what workers fear <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> can be {{affected}} not just by the likelihood of <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> {{but also by the}} costs associated with the loss for a worker. For example, these costs may be lower if a worker has alternative income sources (a second job or a pension).|$|R

5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{starts to}} fear that Maggie could die from {{touching}} things unsafe to her when he hears this from a childproofing saleswoman. As a result, he starts his own childproofing crusade, selling cheap but safe and effective products and making Springfield safe for children. However, this causes the baby-injury-related business in Springfield to go in decline. Homer feels bad for making people such as pediatricians <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and thus he ends his childproofing career.|$|E
5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can {{be compared with the}} 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.|$|E

30|$|In {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of temporary work on absenteeism, however, Jimeno and Toharia (1996) and Ichino and Riphahn (2005) find {{that the threat of}} <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> decreases absenteeism in temporary workers respect to those with open-ended contracts. In a similar vein, Malo and Sánchez-Sánchez (2014) reason that, as temporary workers have a higher probability of <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> than permanent workers, they have a lower probability of being involved in labour conflicts with a positive effect on labour productivity.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that they would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E
5|$|During {{cleaning}} {{day at the}} Simpsons' house, Bart wins a KBBL radio contest {{after the}} station's DJs, Bill and Marty, call him up. They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> They decide on the former option.|$|E
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> {{in the weeks after}} the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
50|$|Burrowing is a slang {{term used}} in the United States to {{describe}} the practice in which political appointees are given civil service protection. Except for judges, political appointees are subject to <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> when a new administration takes power. On the other hand, career government officials are protected from <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> when a new administration takes over. Burrowing is therefore the practice of reassigning {{people who do not}} have civil service protection into jobs that have civil service protection.|$|R

5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Using {{strikes and}} other protest actions, Solidarity sought {{to force a}} change in {{government}} policies. In some cases, as in Bielsko-Biała, Solidarity managed to force corrupt officials {{of the government to}} <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> At the same time, it was careful never to use force or violence, so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play. After 27 Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March 19, a four-hour warning strike on March 27, involving around twelve million people, paralyzed the country. This was the largest strike {{in the history of the}} Eastern bloc, and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings. This concession, and Wałęsa's agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided. Nonetheless the Polish communist party—the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)—had lost its total control over society.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are {{spending}} the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded {{to pick up}} Meg from the roller skating rink. They {{then go to the}} rink and continue to enjoy themselves, but forget to pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car showroom, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog mega store, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon become bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> of Superstore USA's one job taking quahog, like cleveland and mort putting planks on the doors so they will become abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

25|$|When middle-class workers <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{they tend}} to be rehired but for a lower rate of pay.

Journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, found that people went from solid middle-class jobs to minimum-wage employment.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Education (DepEd) is in {{constant}} coordination with CHED and DOLE {{on the actual}} number of affected faculty from private higher education institutions (HEIs).
