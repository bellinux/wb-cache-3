The exercises should be practiced regularly (the exercises are on safety: acceding in <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliance</b> and fire safety system code). The means of evacuation (life raft, life boat, marine evacuation system) must be put to sea once a month and maneuvered once every three month. The GMDSS (global maritime distress on safety system) are controlled by the certificates [...]The pyrotechnic equipment is not tested on board but the personal equipment (immersion suit, life jacket) are regularly tested when there is exercises for abandon ship or if the master decides. The firefighting equipment is tested once a week (mask and breathing apparatus). The fire hoses are rarely tested inside the ship.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Officer/First mate (often {{called the}} Chief mate in the United States) {{is the head}} of the deck {{department}} on a merchant vessel, second-in-command after the ship's Master. The Chief mate's primary responsibilities are the vessel's cargo operations, its stability, and supervising the deck crew. The mate is responsible for the safety and security of the ship, as well as the welfare of the crew on board. The chief mate typically stands the 4-8 navigation watch as OICNW (officer in-charge of the navigational watch), directing the bridge team. Some crews have additional Third mates, which allow the Chief mate to not stand navigational watch, and focus more on cargo and deck operations. Additional duties include maintenance of the ship's hull, cargo gears, accommodations, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> and firefighting appliances. The chief mate also trains the crew and cadets on various aspects like safety, firefighting, search and rescue, and various other contingencies. The chief officer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the master.|$|E
40|$|<b>Life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> {{are used}} {{throughout}} Canada {{and around the}} world every day by a large number of individuals who work or travel over open water. Personnel rely on these <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> to help provide protection from harsh environments, and reduce the risk of injury or death {{in the event of a}} marine accident. Due to their importance in helping to save lives at sea, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> are built and tested according to specific standards and regulations to ensure that they provide the level of performance required. Unfortunately, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> do not always perform as expected which can lead to unexpected injuries or loss of life. Given that <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> must meet specific performance goals as prescribed by standards and regulations, it is often these goals that fall short of what is actually needed during a marine accident. A knowledge gap is created when the testing conditions, as outlined in a standard or regulation, do not accurately reflect those conditions found during a marine accident. As a result, a life saving appliance will often meet performance goals that are below those required to prevent an injury or loss of life during an actual marine accident. The Canadian regulation: 'Life Saving Equipment Regulations' C. R. C., c. 1436 was reviewed and possible knowledge gaps with respect to human factors were identified. The goals and requirements for <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> in the regulation were compared against existing work done in the area of marine safety to determine if what was prescribed adequately reflected what could be found during a marine accident. There were many gaps identified in the regulation, commonly caused by prescriptive wording specifying conditions not commonly found during a marine accident. These knowledge gaps will widen as conditions become more severe than what is prescribed in the regulations possibly leading to even further decrease in life saving appliance performance than what is already measured.

40|$|Abstract- During floods {{disaster}} in the heavy populated residential area, the lack of existing <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances</b> system such as rubber boat and wooden boat {{were not able to}} evacuate the disaster victims spontaneously in mass. The condition might be explained since the rubber boat and wooden boat have limited occupant capacity. Based on the conditions, the main objectives of the research are focused on the evaluation of the application of modular floating pontoon as multipurpose floating equipment to support floods disaster evacuation process. The investigation of the modular floating pontoon performance such as hydrostatics characteristics, the equilibrium condition and the intact stability was studied using strip theory and Krylov’s method. Furthermore, the strength analysis of the modular floating pontoon structure was calculated using finite element method. The results show that the modular floating pontoon is reliable to support the evacuation process...|$|E
40|$|The term Evacuability (passenger {{evacuation}} performance capability) {{entails a}} wide range of capabilities encompassing evaluation of evacuation time, identification of potential bottlenecks, assessment of accommodation module layout, <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances,</b> passenger familiarisation with a ship’s environment, crew training, effective evacuation procedures/strategies, intelligent decision support systems for crisis management and design/modification for ease of evacuation. From a technical point of view, the mass evacuation of thousands of people from an extremely complex environment with unknown inaccessibility problems exacerbated by (potentially co-existing) incidents such as progressive flooding, cargo shift, foundering, fire/smoke and the inherent uncertainty deriving from unpredictability of human behaviour, is a problem with severe modelling difficulties at system, procedural and behavioural levels. In this respect, Evacuability represents a risk measure of passenger evacuation at sea, expressed as an index. Addressing the above, this paper focuses on the development of a passenger evacuation simulation model developed by SSRC in collaboration with Deltamarin, RCI and Color Line. Code-named Evi (Evacuability index), it represents the state-of-the-art computer simulation-based capability for the prediction of passenger mustering and evacuation whilst accounting realistically for human and ship behaviour in a sea environment. Unlike earlier models, Evi has been developed from the outset fo...|$|E
40|$|For {{the safety}} of life and {{property}} at sea, fishing crew {{should be aware of}} certain safety practices. They must know about the safety equipments to be carried on board as per the regulations. They must also have a good knowledge of the operation and maintenance of <b>life</b> <b>saving</b> <b>appliances,</b> fire fighting appliances etc. and should have a thorough knowledge of tackling the emergency situations that may arise while out at sea. Emergencies may include fouling of gear and its effect on the stability of the boat, handling huge catches, man overboard, fire, engine breakdown, leak, grounding, distress and so on. With a fair knowledge of the above aspects, he will gain self confidence and can act in a much better way so that unnecessary loss of life and property could be avoided to a very great extent. Any negligence or ignorance of handling the situation may prove disastrous. This paper will be useful in educating the local fishermen regarding the safety aspects, with which they must be well versed so that life at sea shall be more safe and comfortable than ever before. With some basic knowledge regarding the safety equipments, they will be {{in a better position to}} manage any crisis with confidence. The latest developments and technology in the fisheries field can produce maximum results with available infrastructure...|$|E
