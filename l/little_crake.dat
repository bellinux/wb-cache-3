Buffon, however, takes it with the land-rail; Gould and Yarrell put it between the <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> and water-hen. Gould's {{description}} of {{it is by no means}} clear to me:--he first says it is, in action, as much [...] "like a rat as a bird;" [...] then that it [...] "bounds like a ball," [...] (before the nose of the spaniel); and lastly, in the next sentence, speaks of it as [...] "this lath-like bird"! It is as large as a bantam, but can run, like the Allegretta, on floating leaves; itself, weighing about four ounces and a half (Bewick), and rarely uses the wing, flying very slowly. I imagine the 'lath-like' must mean, like the more frequent epithet 'compressed,' that the bird's body is vertically thin, so as to go easily between close reeds.|$|E

50|$|These birds probe {{with their}} bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals. <b>Little</b> <b>crakes</b> are very secretive in the {{breeding}} season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They can {{be easier to}} see on migration. They are then noisy birds, with a yapping kua call. They nest in a dry location in reed vegetation, laying 4-7 eggs.|$|R

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three <b>little</b> <b>crakes,</b> three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the area}} of the dam nest Northern wheatears. There are greater scaups, mainly velvet scooters, long-tailed ducks or common scoters and red-throated loons and black-throated loons. In Eastern part of the {{reservoir}} in the more densely reeds and willow thickets there are three species of grebes, <b>little</b> bitterns, spotted <b>crakes</b> and Western marsh harriers, and to the end of April there are Savi's warblers species of bird. Various species also rest in the area and are the Eurasian curlews, Northern lapwings, grey plovers and dunlins and curlew sandpipers. There are also ruddy turnstones, Eurasian oystercatchers and red-necked phalarope.|$|R
5|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little bittern, glossy ibis, gyrfalcon (3 records), <b>little</b> and Baillon's <b>crakes,</b> collared pratincole, semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred crossbill, yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|R
5000|$|This is a noisy bird during mating, but its vocalisations {{are quite}} {{different}} from the Eurasian coot. It gives a fast kerrre like the <b>little</b> <b>crake,</b> a harsh ka-haa and a grunting hoot [...] "oot oot" [...] that suggests that the name [...] "coot" [...] might be onomatopoeia, but inspection of the etymology of [...] "coot" [...] fairly decisively negates any such suggestion.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{found in}} the region include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, the golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, the red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, long-eared hedgehog, onager, mangar and the Euphrates {{softshell}} turtle. Birds include, the hooded crow, common starling,Eurasian magpie,European robin, water pipit, spotted flycatcher, namaqua dove, saker falcon, griffon vulture, <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> and collared pratincole, among others.|$|E
50|$|They are 16 - 18 cm in length, and {{are similar}} to the only {{slightly}} larger <b>little</b> <b>crake.</b> Baillon's crake has a short straight bill, yellow or green without a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts with some white markings, and a blue-grey face and underparts. The rear flanks are barred black and white. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is barred underneath.|$|E
5000|$|Laidevahe {{nature reserve}} protects {{an area of}} coastal wetlands, {{comprising}} salt marshes, islets, small lagoons, coastal meadows and so on, but also areas of old-growth forest and alvars. The area is internationally recognized as an important habitat for several species of birds, including the white-tailed eagle which has bred in the area since at least 1995. Other notable bird species found in Laidevahe are dunlin (Calidris alpina), barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> (Porzana parva). [...] The coastal nature reserve is also rich in fish, and in addition is a habitat for both otter and grey seal. As for the flora, several species of orchid grow in the nature reserve - for example, early purple orchid, greater butterfly orchid and lady slipper orchids.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} among the smaller members of their family, none being larger than a chicken and some really tiny, smaller than a {{starling}} or thrush. Their upperparts are a cryptic lighter or darker brownish hue. The underside is also brown in some, but more often buff or grey. Several species have patterns like whitish dots or black-and-white barred flanks, conspicuous close up, but at a distance providing additional camouflage in these birds' habitat. Some others are rather uniformly blackish-brown all over. The bill and feet are often brightly colored in red to yellow hues; the eyes' iris has some reddish-brownish hue, sometimes being bright red and also very conspicuous at close quarters. Porzana males and females generally differ barely if at all; in the <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> (P. parva), however, they differ so much they might be mistaken for separate species.|$|E
50|$|At 17 - 19 cm in length, {{they are}} {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} spotted crake, from which they are readily distinguished {{by the lack of}} dark barring and white spots on the flanks. The <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> has a short straight bill, yellow with a red base. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is barred black and white underneath. Unlike other Porzana crakes, this species has strong sexual dimorphism: Adult males have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey face and underparts. They resemble the sympatric Baillon's crake (P. pusilla), which has strongly barred flanks and is a little smaller. Females have buff underparts, and are grey only on the face; they are more similar to the yellow-breasted crake (P. flaviventer) of the American tropics. Immature little crakes are similar to the female but have a white face and breast. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.|$|E
50|$|Other birds (especially non-passeriforms) {{sometimes}} have songs to attract mates or hold territory, {{but these are}} usually simple and repetitive, lacking the variety of many oscine songs. The monotonous repetition of the common cuckoo or <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> can be contrasted with the variety of a nightingale or marsh warbler. On the other hand, although many songbirds have songs which are pleasant to the human ear, this is not invariably the case. Many members of the crow family (Corvidae) communicate with croaks or screeches which sound harsh to humans. Even these, however, have a song of sorts, a softer twitter which is given between courting partners. And even though some parrots (which are not songbirds) can be taught to repeat human speech, vocal mimicry among birds is almost completely restricted to songbirds, some of which (such as the lyrebirds or the aptly-named mockingbirds) excel in imitating the sounds of other birds or even environmental noises.|$|E

40|$|Background Habitat {{selection}} and its adaptive outcomes are crucial features for animal life-history strategies. Nevertheless, congruence between habitat preferences and breeding {{success has been}} rarely demonstrated, which may result from the single-scale evaluation of animal choices. As habitat selection is a complex multi-scale process in many groups of animal species, investigating adaptiveness of habitat selection in a multi-scale framework is crucial. In this study, we explore whether habitat preferences acting at different spatial scales enhance the fitness of bird species, and check the appropriateness of single vs. multi-scale models. We expected that {{variables found to be}} more important for habitat selection at individual scale(s), would coherently {{play a major role in}} affecting nest survival at the same scale(s). Methods We considered habitat preferences of two Rallidae species, <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> (Zapornia parva) and water rail (Rallus aquaticus), at three spatial scales (landscape, territory, and nest-site) and related them to nest survival. Single-scale versus multi-scale models (GLS and glmmPQL) were compared to check which model better described adaptiveness of habitat preferences. Consistency between the effect of variables on habitat {{selection and}} on nest survival was checked to investigate their adaptive value. Results In both species, multi-scale models for nest survival were more supported than single-scale ones. In <b>little</b> <b>crake,</b> the multi-scale model indicated vegetation density and water depth at the territory scale, as well as vegetation height at nest-site scale, as the most important variables. The first two variables were among the most important for nest survival and habitat selection, and the coherent effects suggested the adaptive value of habitat preferences. In water rail, the multi-scale model of nest survival showed vegetation density at territory scale and extent of emergent vegetation within landscape scale as the most important ones, although we found a consistent effect with the habitat selection model (and hence evidence for adaptiveness) only for the former. Discussion Our work suggests caution when interpreting adaptiveness of habitat preferences at a single spatial scale because such an approach may under- or over-estimate the importance of habitat factors. As an example, we found evidence only for a weak effect of water depth at territory scale on <b>little</b> <b>crake</b> nest survival; however, according to the multi-scale analysis, such effect turned out to be important and appeared highly adaptive. Therefore, multi-scale approaches to the study of adaptive explanations for habitat selection mechanisms should be promoted...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The fishponds „Lipniak ” {{are located}} in Rawa village (the {{province}} of Lublin, eastern Poland), about 45 km to the north-west of Lublin. The complex consists of 13 carp ponds surroun-ded by a forest and meadows. The total surface area of the ponds is 118. 83 ha. The research {{was carried out in}} the breeding season in 2004 and 2005, and during the whole year 2007 (a total of 60 censuses). The subject of the study were 57 species belonging to the group of waterfowl, among them 22 breeding species. Among the breeding species there were 7 species which belonged to Passeriformes. 4 species of birds from the „Polish Red Data Book of Animals ” [Głowaciński 2001] were also breeding on the fishponds: Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, Bittern Botaurus stellaris, <b>Little</b> <b>Crake</b> Porzana parva, and Bluethroat Luscinia svecica cyanecula. The most nu-merous breeding species were the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos (17 – 28 pairs) and the Coot Fulica atra (9 – 27 pairs). The largest abundance of species was observed during the migration period, when 36 species were recorded (35 species in the spring and 19 species in autumn). The most nu-merous species were the Mute Swan Cygnus olor (the maximum of 158 individuals), the Mallard (max 549 ind.), the Coot (max 357 ind.), and also the Wigeon Anas penelope (max 86 ind.), the Pochar...|$|E
