5000|$|In {{any event}} {{it is not}} to be doubted that Arnaud in {{particular}} had the Canadians’ interest sincerely at heart, (Jean’s rôle in matters relating to New-France faded soon after his posting, around 1750, as commissary at Saint-Domingue,now Haiti, where the <b>La</b> <b>Portes</b> also had extensive private investments).

5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and <b>La</b> <b>Porte,</b> {{straddles the}} Houston Ship Channel {{and has since}} the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E

5|$|From 1963 to 1970, Kaegi {{worked at}} the Centre de Recherches Sonores, the electroacoustic music studio of Radio Suisse Romande in Geneva.

At the C.R.S., Kaegi created several radiophonic works; such as <b>La</b> <b>Porte</b> Noire in 1964 and Zéa in 1965. In the late 1960s, Kaegi wrote several essays on electronic music, including the influential book Was ist elektronische Musik?, ("What Is Electronic Music?"), {{which was published in}} 1967 in Zurich, Switzerland, and also became a film for Swiss television.|$|E

50|$|As shipyards and {{industrial}} plants in World War II {{were developed in}} nearby communities such as Pasadena, Baytown, and Deer Park, the community's residents became more dependent on these businesses. The opening of the La Porte-Baytown tunnel in 1954 further spurred development. The later establishment of the Johnson Space Center in the nearby Clear Lake Area, the Barbours Cut shipping terminal in neighboring Morgan's Point, and the Bayport Industrial District within <b>La</b> <b>Porte's</b> jurisdiction have gradually made the community successful {{as part of the}} Houston area's industrial heartland.|$|R
5|$|Interstate 45 (the Gulf Freeway) is {{the major}} freeway for the core areas of the Bay Area linking them with Houston and Galveston.

5|$|The Leclerc main {{battle tank}} built by GIAT Industries (Groupement Industriel des Armements Terrestres) of France {{is named after}} him.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war the Texas economy declined for a period. Nevertheless, ranching interests became major economic drivers in the area spawning many other economic enterprises such as hide processing plants and shipping concerns. The success of these enterprises and the growth of Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway; and the <b>La</b> <b>Porte,</b> Houston and Northern Railroad through the area {{over the course of the}} 19th century. These railroads running along the southwest shore of the bay would spawn new communities such as Clear Creek (League City), Webster, and later Texas City.|$|E
50|$|The beachfront {{began to}} {{physically}} shrink beginning around 1928 because of erosion from the wakes of shipping traffic, and land subsidence {{resulting from the}} extraction of groundwater in the area due to development. Gas rationing in World War II slowed tourism. A hurricane in 1943 destroyed most of the tourist attractions. Most of the damaged structures at Sylvan Beach were never rebuilt after this time, as the area was changing, and <b>La</b> <b>Porte's</b> tourist industry rapidly declined. By the later 20th century, erosion had completely eliminated the beach.|$|R

Paul-Félix Taillade, who had appeared in The Children of Captain Grant, was cast as Doctor Ox, and Marie Daubrun, a well-known féerie actress who was also the mistress and muse of Charles Baudelaire, played Eva. The production was directed by Paul Clèves (born Paul Collin), the director of the Théâtre de <b>la</b> <b>Porte</b> Saint-Martin from 1879 to 1883.

5|$|The play {{opened in}} Paris at the Théâtre de <b>la</b> <b>Porte</b> Saint-Martin on 25 November 1882, and {{achieved}} a financially successful run of 97 performances. Contemporary critics gave the play mixed reviews; in general, the spectacular staging {{and the use}} of ideas from Verne's books were highly praised, while the symbolism and moral themes in the script were criticized and attributed to the collaboration of d'Ennery. The play was not published during Verne's lifetime and was presumed lost until 1978, when a single handwritten copy of the script was discovered; the text has since been published in both French and English. Recent scholars have discussed the play's exploration of the fantasy genre and of initiation myths, its use of characters and concepts from Verne's novels, and of the ambiguous treatment of scientific ambition in the play, marking a transition from optimism to pessimism in Verne's treatment of scientific themes.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the naval battle, Philip IV, who {{expected}} that the French fleet would have been destroyed, and the honour of his navy restored, dismissed and imprisoned Count of Linhares and Admiral Pimienta, among other officers, accusing them of mismanagement and abandonment of their forces. Linhares was replaced by Luis Fernández de Córdoba, Pimienta by Jerónimo Gómez de Sandoval, and Bazán del Viso by Giannettino Doria. Philip IV also appointed his 17 years old illegitimate son John of Austria as Príncipe de la mar, commander of all the Hispanic maritime forces, giving them widespread orders and powers in order to end with the misrule of the Spanish Navy. The French failure at Orbetello, nevertheless, contributed greatly to the reduction the French pressure in Italy. 6,000 soldiers from Naples could be consequently carried to Valencia to fight against the French armies in Catalonia. On September, a French expedition led by Charles de <b>la</b> <b>Porte</b> de la Meilleraye, with Portuguese help, succeeded in capturing both the presidi of Piombino and Porto Longone, which encouraged the Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, to change his allegiance from the Spanish monarchy to France.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and <b>La</b> <b>Porte.</b> The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{two of the}} lithographic copies made in Egypt {{had reached}} the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, {{librarian}} and antiquarian Gabriel de <b>La</b> <b>Porte</b> du Theil set {{to work on a}} translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal Archaeologia in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.|$|E
