5000|$|Vermonica is {{a public}} art {{installation}} initiated by artist Sheila Klein in 1993. The sculpture is named for the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in East Hollywood. Some of the artwork's 25 lamp poles date to 1925, the year <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles's</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Street Lighting opened. Placed {{in front of a}} Rite-Aid, the lights glow to illuminate the mini-mall parking lot it is located in at specific times during the night. [...] Sheila Klein cooperated with <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> businesses, <b>bureaus,</b> departments and neighborhoods to erect what she describes as a [...] "formal composition" [...] and a [...] "drive-in museum" [...] of street lighting. Vermonica was envisioned initially as a temporary installation with borrowed poles from the nearby streetlight yard on Santa Monica Boulevard. The sculpture was so popular, however, that it was kept installed. Vermonica precedes Chris Burden's Urban Light by 15 years.|$|R
2500|$|Hartsook's {{success as}} a {{photographer}} and studio owner allowed him to expand into other cities along the Pacific Coast, including San Francisco and Oakland.

2500|$|In {{the final}} episode produced, the writers {{attempted}} a [...] "relaunch" [...] of sorts by having Diana reassigned to the <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>bureau</b> of IADC {{with a new}} supporting cast. Though done {{in anticipation of a}} fourth season, the revamp was seen for only a single episode ("The Man Who Could Not Die"), which set up an assortment of new supporting characters. These included Dale Hawthorn, Diana's new IADC boss, Bret Cassiday (Bob Seagren), a genetically enhanced man who was indestructible (the titular character of the episode), as well as a streetwise youngster named T. Burton Phipps III who inexplicably is allowed to hang out at the IADC. Also added to the cast was a chimpanzee who, like Bret, is also indestructible. This episode was actually the last to be produced and should have ended the third season, but was shown out of sequence with the two-parter [...] "The Phantom of the Roller Coaster." [...] These final three episodes aired by themselves in August–September 1979, months after the broadcast of the rest of season three, creating a mini-season, though they remain grouped as part of season three as opposed to being considered an abbreviated fourth season.|$|E
