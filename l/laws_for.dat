5|$|Article VII of the Constitution sets up {{the basic}} {{framework}} for the structure and function of local government in Virginia. Local government may be established at the town (population over 1000), city (population over 5000), county or regional government level. Article VII gives the General Assembly the power to create general <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> the organization and governing of these political subdivisions, except that regional governments cannot be created {{without the consent of}} the majority of the voters who vote on the issue in the region.|$|E

Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

40|$|The diploma {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} the <b>law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment protection and the <b>law</b> <b>for</b> nature preservation on agriculture land. First part of diploma defins the idea of The <b>law</b> <b>for</b> ecology and his goals. It presents the starting-point of diploma and gives constitutional fundaments of ecological law. In end is described the difference between law of enviorment and ecological law. Second part {{discusses the}} limits of owners rights when handling with real estate. That problem is being seen through different <b>laws.</b> <b>Law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment handling, <b>law</b> <b>for</b> waters keeping, <b>law</b> <b>for</b> nature preservation, <b>law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment protection and <b>law</b> <b>for</b> mining. Third part paraphrases <b>law</b> <b>for</b> nature preservation and <b>law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment protection. This part also gives us fundamental basics of these laws. Main, central part of diploma consists of two chapters. Chapters talk about the parts of <b>law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment protection end <b>law</b> <b>for</b> nature preservation, which has influence on agriculture land. <b>Law</b> <b>for</b> enviorment protection settles enviorment protection ahead of aggravation as the fundamental condition <b>for</b> permanent development. <b>Law</b> talks about programms for enviorment protection, gives enviorment protection starting-points, interventions into enviorment, changing the enviorment and enviormental informations. <b>Law</b> <b>for</b> nature preservation gives us the way how to preserve the biotic variety and system to contribute nature preservation. Law talks about preservation of biotic variety with nature values and giving peremitions for changes in natural areas. In last part are given some casses of restrictive areas, which have influence on agriculture land. These are areas with limited chances for agriculture activitis. Such as wrinkled grasslands, areas where big,wild animals appear, ecological important areas and water-protective areas...|$|R

The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> certain ethnicities.|$|E

Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , <b>Laws</b> <b>for</b> me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic <b>laws.</b> <b>For</b> instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> which there is no particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its promulgation did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians.

5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool.

Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical <b>laws.</b> <b>For</b> illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

Alfonsín sought to reduce the Peronist influence over the unions, fearing that they may become a destabilizing force for the fledgling democracy. He rejected their custom of holding single-candidate internal elections, and deemed them totalitarian and not genuine representatives of the workforce. His proposal was to change the <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> those internal elections, remove the union leaders appointed during the dictatorship, and elect new ones under the new laws. The CGT rejected the proposal as interventionist, and prompted Peronist politicians to vote against it. The law {{was approved by the}} Chamber of Deputies but failed to pass in the Senate by one vote. A second bill proposed simply a call to elections, without supervision from the government, which was approved. As a result, the unions remained Peronist.|$|E

5|$|Since 1971, the {{government}} has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the federal structure, {{the government}} is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a bicameral body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms. The judicial system, the oldest in America, consists of a hierarchy from the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia to the Circuit Courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts.|$|E
