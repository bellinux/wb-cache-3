40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} link {{between the use of}} aggressive mortgage <b>lending</b> <b>instruments,</b> such as interest only, negative amortization or subprime, mortgages and the underlying house price volatility. Such instruments, which come into existence through innovation or financial deregulation, allow more borrowing than otherwise would occur. Within the context of a theoretical model with borrowing constraints, we demonstrate that the supply of aggressive <b>lending</b> <b>instruments</b> temporarily increase the asset prices in the underlying market because borrowers use these instruments to further leverage their current income. Furthermore, in our model when lenders re-price mortgage instruments following a negative demand shock, we show that the relative use of aggressive <b>lending</b> <b>instruments</b> declines. These two results imply that the availability of aggressive mortgage <b>lending</b> <b>instruments</b> magnifies the real estate cycle and the effects of large negative demand shocks. Using both local and national price index data we empirically confirm the predictions of the model. In particular, we find that neighborhoods and cities that experience a high concentration of aggressive <b>lending</b> <b>instruments</b> at their respective real estate market peaks suffer more severe price declines and a lower supply of aggressive instruments following a negative demand shock.

Firstly, we separately analyze IDA credits and IBRD loans and the various World Bank <b>lending</b> <b>instrument</b> (i. e. projects, adjustment loans and budget supports). Secondly, looking at overall assessment of projects (provided by the World Bank’s Independent Eval-uation Group, IEG), we determine whether higher quality loans are associated with lower levels of corruption in recipient countries.

Following the implementation of the Governance and Anti Corruption (GAC) objectives in 1997, projects and Development Policy Lending (DPL) tend to be oriented toward better governed countries. However, we find no evidence that World Bank loans reduce corruption in recipient countries. Instead, unsatisfactory DPL (as measured by IEG ratings) tend to worsen corruption in recipient countries.

40|$|Much of the {{academic}} debate {{on the effectiveness of}} foreign aid is centered on the relationship between aid and growth. Different aid-growth studies find conflicting results: aid promotes growth everywhere; aid has a zero or negative impact on growth everywhere; or the effect of aid on growth depends on recipient-specific characteristics, such as the quality of institutions and policies. Although these studies fuel an interesting debate, cross-sectional macroeconomic studies cannot be the last word on the topic of aid effectiveness. In this paper, Dollar and Levin introduce microeconomic evidence on factors conducive to the success of aid-funded projects in developing countries. The authors use the success rate of World Bank-financed projects in the 1990 s, as determined by the Operations Evaluation Department, as their dependent variable. Using instrumental variables estimation, the authors find that existence of high-quality institutions in a recipient country raises the probability that aid will be used effectively. There is also some evidence that geography matters, but location in Sub-Saharan Africa is a more robust indicator of lower project success rate than tropical climate. The authors proceed to disaggregate the success rate of World Bank projects by <b>lending</b> <b>instrument</b> type and by investment sector, finding that different institutions are more important for different types of projects. The finding of a strong relationship between institutional quality and project success serves to provide further support to the hypothesis that aid effectiveness is conditional on institutions and policies of the recipient country.

40|$|An {{overdraft}} is a <b>lending</b> <b>instrument,</b> usually {{offered by}} banks, {{that for a}} predetermined period allows the borrower to overdraw his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is {{at the discretion of}} the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks is predominantly by overdrafts and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of business borrowers. The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by overdraft is determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of business borrowers (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft utilisation ratios in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets. ...|$|E
40|$|Trade and {{regional}} integration in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have been constant {{goals of the}} Inter-American Development Bank (IDB, or Bank) since its inception. While the Bank has historically had a very active role in policy discussions with and technical assistance to countries on these issues, it {{has not had a}} substantial regional lending program in this area. Indeed, the trade and integration portfolio is divided between the nonlending part, mostly led by the Trade and Integration Sector, and the infrastructure integration part (where the bulk of the lending is concentrated), led by the infrastructure sector. However, this lending portfolio is composed almost exclusively of national projects with typically no proven regional benefits beyond the purely national ones. The main reason for the paucity of projects with regional benefits is that working regionally is associated with higher transaction costs for both the Bank and the countries, and the Bank still lacks a concessional <b>lending</b> <b>instrument.</b> Under the IDB- 9 Agreement, the Bank reiterated regional integration as one of the priorities, attaching a specific lending target to it. Management was required to produce a new regional integration strategy and an action plan to guide the actions of the Bank. The new Integration Strategy has a thorough {{understanding of the nature of}} the challenges to regional integration and contains a complete and sound diagnosis of trade issues in LAC. Although the diagnosis of infrastructure integration {{and regional}} public goods is weaker, the Strategy remains relevant to identify the main challenges and the recent evolution of trade and integration in LAC. The Strategy and Action Plan provide little guidance, however, beyond outlining the main ideas. Although a first draft identified the need for concessional instruments, the final version proposed only a "smart mix" of existing instruments. The Strategy does not clearly define and build on the Bank¿s comparative advantage or record of past experience. The definition and classification of "regional integration projects" are confused; depending on the source chosen, regional integration projects represent between 0. 6 % and 25 % of Bank lending in 2011. The baseline for lending in the IDB- 9 Agreement (10 %) is unrealistic given the Bank's historic performance, and projects without any connection with either regional integration or the Integration Strategy are being labeled as regional. The Strategy and the Action Plan mostly describe what the Bank currently does rather than provide strategic leadership or direction. The Bank is now at a crossroads. Different options are available depending on the risk appetite of Governors and the willingness of the LAC Region to advance toward regional integration. Instead of pursuing the current low-risk and low-payoff strategy, Governors may wish to tackle the problems that have precluded lending for regional integration, including providing preferential access to resources for regional integration projects with clear eligibility guidelines. In any case Management should revisit its classification system for regional lending and provide a more transparent and more accurate picture of actual Bank work in this area. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this year's annual sector review blends two special topics: poverty {{alleviation}} {{and the development of}} management and institutional capacity. Based on a review of project experience, both within and outside of the population, health and nutrition (PHN) sector, this report distills lessons that should assist task managers in the design and implementation of interventions to develop poverty-sensitive management and institutional capacity in the PHN sector. The Bank's ability to strengthen institutions, especially those needed to alleviate poverty, are constrained by the number and the skills mix of PHN staff, by the absence of standards and guidelines for analyzing and addressing institutional and management issues, and by too little time to spend on institutional and management issues. Therefore, the sector review recommends : a) improving the sector staff not only in numbers but in access to guidelines and training; b) revising Bank priorities and practices to ensure that enough time is spent on supervision and on upstream diagnostic work; c) grounding PHN policies in a macroeconomic and multisectoral framework oriented toward growth with poverty reduction, together with a sound strategy for building institutions and the capacity to implement and manage policy; and d) seeking more creative use of Bank instruments through a review and assessment of the best use of <b>lending</b> <b>instruments</b> for PHN sector interventions.
