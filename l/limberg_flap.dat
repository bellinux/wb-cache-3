40|$|OBJECTİVE:Pilonidal sinus is {{characterized}} by high operative morbidity mainly due to wound problems. We aimed to compare the quality of health, comfort and psychological status in patients who underwent surgery for pilonidal sinus. METHODS:A total of 205 pilonidal sinus patients operated on with either primary closure or <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> reconstruction were compared in terms of depression, anxiety, and long-term quality of health by using Short Form 36, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory scales. RESULTS:There were 107 patients in the primary closure group with a mean follow-up of 29. 6 ± 7. 7 months and 98 patients in the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group with a mean follow-up of 34. 1 ± 7. 3 months. In the SF- 36 analysis, the mental health and bodily pain scores (59 ± 6 and 56 ± 11 in the primary closure group and 62 ± 8 and 61 ± 10 in the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group) were significantly higher in the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group (p= 0. 014 and p= 0. 002, respectively). The mean Beck Depression Inventory (19 ± 6. 13 vs. 16 ± 4. 90 p< 0. 001) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (19 ± 6. 27 vs. 16 ± 4. 90 p< 0. 001) scores were lower in the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group. CONCLUSION:Limberg flap reconstruction produced better quality of health scores according to the SF 36, {{especially in terms of}} mental health and bodily pain.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is {{a benign}} disease caused by hair follicles in sacrococcygeal region. Despite {{the use of}} {{different}} methods in treatment, {{there is no consensus}} reached for treatment modalities. In this study we compared the primary repair and <b>limberg</b> <b>flap</b> method. Material and Methods: In this study, 376 PSD patients who underwent surgery in our clinic between 2005 - 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. 184 of these patients managed with primary repair and 192 with <b>limberg</b> <b>flap.</b> Patients who have acute enflamation symptoms and abcess were excluded. Patients evaluated rertospectively. All data examined for statistical analysis. Results: Surgery time and hospital stay were significantly higher in patients who underwent <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> repair (p 0, 05). But cosmetic care, surgical site paresthesia were found higher in <b>limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group(p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Many methods have been defined for repair of the pilonidal disease. However, none of these treatments can not prevent recurrence and fully cure. Primary repair method is still can be preferred because of its cosmetic results, minimally invasive procedure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Sacrococcygeal {{pilonidal}} sinus {{is common}} in young men and may recur over time after surgery. We investigated whether a factor exists that can aid in {{the determination of the}} preferred technique between the early <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> and Karydakis flap techniques for treating recurrent pilonidal sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective and randomized study enrolled 71 patients with recurrent pilonidal sinus in whom the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> or Karydakis flap techniques were applied for reconstruction after excision. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: 37 patients were treated with the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> technique and 34 patients were treated with the Karydakis flap technique. Fluid collection, wound infection, flap edema, hematoma, partial wound separation, return to daily activities, pain score, complete healing time, painless seating and patient satisfaction were compared between the groups. ClinicalTrial. gov: NCT 02287935. RESULTS: The development rates of total fluid collection, wound infection, flap edema, hematoma, and partial wound separation were 9. 8 %, 16 %, 7 %, 15 % and 4. 2 %, respectively; total flap necrosis was not observed in any patient (p< 0. 001). During the average follow-up of 28 months, no patients (0 %) developed recurrent disease. The two groups differed with respect to early surgical complications (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In this study, use of the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> was associated with lower complication rates, shorter length of hospital stay, early return to work, low pain score, high patient satisfaction and better complete healing duration.

40|$|Objective: To {{create a}} {{comprehensive}} algorithmic approach to reconstruction after vulvar cancer ablative surgery, which includes {{both traditional and}} perforator flaps, evaluating anatomical subunits {{and shape of the}} defect. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 80 cases of reconstruction after vulvar cancer ablative surgery, performed between June 2006 and January 2016, transferring 101 flaps. We registered the possibility to achieve the complete wound closure, even in presence of very complex defects, and the postoperative complications. On the basis of these experience, analyzing the choices made and considering the complications, we developed an algorithm to help with the selection of the flap in vulvoperineal reconstruction after oncologic ablative surgery for vulvar cancer. Results: We employed eight types of different flaps, including 54 traditional fasciocutaneous V-Y flaps, 23 rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps, 11 anterolateral thigh flaps, three V-Y gracilis myocutaneous flaps, three free style perforators V-Y flaps from the inner thigh, two <b>Limberg</b> <b>flaps,</b> two lotus flaps, two deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap, and one superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator flap. The structures most frequently involved in resection were vulva, perineum, mons pubis, groins, vagina, urethra and, more rarely, rectum, bladder, and lower abdominal wall. Conclusion: The algorithm we implemented can be a useful tool to help flap selection. The key points in the decision-making process are: anatomical subunits to be covered, overall shape and symmetry of the defect and some patient features such as skin laxity or previous radiotherapy. Perforator flaps, when feasible, must be considered standard in vulvoperineal reconstruction, although in some cases traditional flaps remain the best choice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPilonidal {{disease is}} a common chronic disorder, mostly {{affecting}} young adult males. Different hypotheses have been introduced for this disease, but acquired pathogenesis is the most acceptable one. Furthermore, different types of intervention are performed based on its pathogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare excision with primary repair versus the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap.</b> Materials and methodsOne hundred patients, who were enrolled in this study were randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients. One group underwent excision with primary repair and the other group rhomboid excision with the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap.</b> Then the demographic characteristics, early and late complications, comfort and pain score on the first and fourth postoperative day, hospital stay, time of return to work, and patient satisfaction were compared.

40|$|Objectives: Pilonidal sinus is {{a common}} chronic disease of the sacrococcygeal region. Treatment varies in {{relation}} to the presentation of the disease. Accordingly, several surgical methods show that the most ideal method is not still found because of high recurrence rates. We investigated the efficacy of rhomboid excision and <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> in the treatment of pilonidal sinus. Materials and methods: Because of chronic and subacute sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease rhomboid excision and <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> closure technique was applied to 32 (Male / Female 21 / 11) patients. The median follow-up duration was 4 to 9 months. Operative time, hospital stay, recurrence rate and early complications were compared. Results: The mean age of the patients was 28. 8 ± 23 years; mean operative time was 68 (52 - 77) minutes. The average hospital stay was 1 (1 - 3). Early wound complications were in 6. 2 % (n= 2) patients. There was no recurrence during follow-up. Conclusion: The results show that rhomboid excision and <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> closure technique can be used particularly for the treatment of large sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus cases. It may be preferred for low relapse rate, short hospital stay, low complication rates and labor force loss, despite poor cosmetic results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two {{different}} treatment methods for pilonidal sinus with respect to complications, recurrence, and patient quality of life. Methods: Five hundred forty-nine patients who underwent surgery for pilonidal sinus between January 2007 and August 2012 were included in this study. The patients were classified into group I (excision and primary closure) and group II (<b>Limberg</b> <b>flap).</b> Results: There was no significant difference in the mean age and gender of the patients between groups I and II (P = 0. 512 and P = 0. 472). The duration of surgical operation was lower in group I (P < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in hospitalization time after surgery, minor complications, and recurrence between the groups (P = 0. 674, P = 1. 000, and P = 1. 000, respectively). The time required for pain-free walking, urinating, and returning to work was significantly lower in group II (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, and P < 0. 001, respectively). The patients in group I stated that they were more satisfied in terms of aesthetics (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Pilonidal sinus {{disease is}} a benign {{disorder}} with an unidentified etiology and is observed mainly in young adults. It is an important health problem because it causes work loss. Although various nonsurgical treatment options have been tried up to date, there is a consensus on surgical intervention to treat the disease today. The optimal surgical method should be simple, associated with short hospital stay and low recurrence rates. In this study, patients who have undergone different surgical treatment methods due to pilonidal disease were retrospectively analyzed. The medical records of 175 patients who were operated on between 2002 and 2005 at the General Surgery Departments of Gaziosmanpasa University Medical School and Bartin State Hospital for pilonidal disease were reviewed for treatment option, postoperative complications, hospitalization time, work-off periods, and recurrence rates. The patients consisted of 150 (85. 3 %) males {{with a mean age}} of 26. 47 ± 7. 78 years. Marsupialization was applied to 82 (46. 9 %), unroofing to 20 (14. 7 %), primary closure to 29 (16. 6 %), and <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> to 44 (25. 1 %) patients. The longest hospitalization period of 3. 61 ± 1. 08 days was observed in the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> group. The longest return to work period (20. 12 ± 5. 1 days) was observed in the marsupialization group. Both differences were significant. The highest complication rate was observed among the primary closure group (31 %) followed by the patients treated by <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> technique (15. 8 %). In the primary closure group, infection was detected in five (17. 2 %) and wound dehiscence in four (13. 8 %) individuals. The highest complication rates (31. 03 %) and recurrences (13. 8 %) were observed in the primary closure group. Various operative methods utilized in the treatment of pilonidal disease are associated with a number of advantages and disadvantages. Postoperative complication rates of unroofing and marsupialization are low, but require long wound care. In our study, we did not observe any recurrence among the patients treated by unroofing, but experienced a high recurrence ratio among subjects treated by marsupialization.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare and analyze the short term results of {{modified}} Karydakis flap reconstruction (MKF) and modified <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> reconstruction (MLF). This is a retrospective analysis of 81 patients operated for pilonidal sinus disease. There were 46 patients in MLF group and 35 patients in MKF group. We compared patients age, BMI, operation time, removal time of suction drain, time of feeling completely healed, type of presentation, complications, postoperative 1., 3., 5. Days VAS scores, time to stop analgesic drugs and time to sit on chair or throne without pain. Complication rate, analgesic drug stopping time, postoperative 5. days VAS score were lower in MLF group and there were significant difference between groups. MLF group patients feel better (P: 0. 010), they recommended this operation to other pilonidal sinus patients (P: 0. 010) and 36 of them rated their satisfaction excellent and 10 of them good (P: 0. 010). MLF procedure was more comfortable for patients. Lesser pain, lower complication and recurrence rates and higher patient satisfaction were detected in MLF group...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCongenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) {{are present}} in 1 – 2 % of newborn infants. The size of CMN defines the risk of {{developing}} melanoma which is estimated from 5 – 10 %, especially in lesions that are located across the spine. Presentation of caseHerein we report a case where nodular melanoma was discovered on the periphery of medium sized CMN in a high risk patient. After complete excision, the defect was reconstructed with random pattern, triple rhomboid flap. DiscussionMelanoma that arose within medium sized CMN would leave a complex posterior lower trunk defect. We used a triple <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> which was proven to be straightforward and simple method when large defects are to be covered with vital tissue. We have also showed that this type of reconstruction is suitable for high risk patients that could not withstand any complex procedures. ConclusionIn our case, the method we choose to reconstruct the defect proved to be simple, safe and easy, especially when surgery is performed in a high risk patient...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ectopic primary {{carcinoma}} of breast tissue {{is a rare}} entity, and its diagnosis often is delayed. The axilla {{is the most common}} site involved. The <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> as a random flap is easy and practicable for coverage of many defects including those involving the axilla. In the reported case, the vascularity of the flap was improved by including a thoracodorsal artery perforator. Methods: This report presents the clinical features of a case of ectopic breast carcinoma in the axilla and an alternative tension-free Limberg thoracodorsal artery perforator flap for reconstruction of the extended defect after excision of the tumor. Results: The flap survived and healed without further problems. A good functional and aesthetic result was obtained. Conclusion: Ectopic primary {{carcinoma of}} breast tissue is a rare entity. Correct early diagnosis should be made. A tension-free fasciocutaneous flap according to Limberg, supercharged using a thoracodorsal artery perforator, can provide skin and soft tissue coverage for extended defects in the axilla with a satisfactory outcome. The operative procedure is easy and reliable. This is a further surgical option for soft tissue extended reconstruction in the armpit.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, we {{investigated}} {{whether there is}} a factor that can aid deter-mi nation of the preferred technique by comparing the early and late results of two different surgical techniques for the treatment of pilonidal sinus. Methods: The medical records of 176 patients in whom the <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> (LF) or V-Y flap techniques were applied for reconstruction after the excision were eva-luated retrospectively. Results: The development rates of postoperative hematoma, wound separation, wound infection, and seroma were 2. 8 %, 5. 1 %, 5. 6 %, and 6. 3 %, respectively, while total flap necrosis was not observed in any patient. Return to daily activities was achieved after a mean of 17. 1 days (13 to 21 days) days in the LF group and 32. 7 days (18 to 47 days) in the V-Y flap group. During the average follow-up of 65 months (36 to 110 months), nine patients (5. 1 %) developed recurrent disease. There was no {{difference between the two groups}} with respect to early surgical complications (P = 0. 286) or disease recurrence (P = 0. 094), whereas the resumption of daily activities was longer in patients with a V-Y flap (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The early postoperative and long-term results of the LF and V-Y flap techniques for the treatment of pilonidal sinus were similar. Because the resumption of daily activities at work is achieved later in patients undergoing the V-Y flap compared with the LF technique, patients ’ employment (or position in working life) must be considered when determining the most appropriate surgical technique...|$|E
40|$|Background Pilonidal sinus {{disease is}} a common {{condition}} that mainly affects young adults. This condition can cause significant pain and impairment of normal activities. No consensus currently exists on the optimum treatment for pilonidal sinus and current therapies have various advantages and disadvantages. Fibrin glue {{has emerged as a}} potential treatment as both monotherapy and an adjunct to surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of fibrin glue alone or in combination with surgery compared with surgery alone in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease. Search methods In December 2016 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase and CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and conference proceedings for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies involving participants of all ages and studies conducted in any setting. We considered studies involving people with both new and recurrent pilonidal sinus. We included studies which evaluated fibrin glue monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgery. Data collection and analysis Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Main results We included four RCTs with 253 participants, all were at risk of bias. One unpublished study evaluated fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, two studies evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to <b>Limberg</b> <b>flap</b> and one study evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to Karydakis flap. For fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, there were no data available for the primary outcomes of time to healing and adverse events. There was low-quality evidence of less pain on day one after the procedure with fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure (mean difference (MD) - 2. 50, 95...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Although {{pilonidal}} {{disease is}} experienced commonly, {{there is no}} definitive algorithm. Our purpose is to contribute in determining treatment algorithm by comparing the conservative phenol treatment (PT) method with <b>limberg</b> <b>flap</b> technique (LFT) used frequently for pilonidal disease surgery. Material and Method: Patients diagnosed with pilonidal sinus and treated with PT and LFT between February 2011 and September 2014 in Buca Seyfi Demirsoy State Hospital General Surgery service are retrospectively enrolled in the study. Patients are contacted {{with the help of}} their files and included in the study. Patients are compared in terms of age, gender, pain-free walking and start date for going back to work, complications, success and relapse ratios. Results: 73 (81. 1 %) of the cases were male, 17 (18. 9 %) were female and their average age was 24 ± 8. 4 (14 - 55). No statistically significant difference was detected between patients who have undergone LFT and PT in terms of success and relapse (p> 0, 05). Hospitalization period was average 1. 55 ± 0. 9 days for patients who have undergone LFT. FT was applied as outpatient treatment for all patients. A statistically significant difference was determined in favor of PT as a result of comparing postoperative complications, pain-free walking and start date for going back to work (p= 0, 00). Discussion: In our study, we have proven that LFT, which is a method used frequently with recognized success is not superior to PT in terms of success and relapse ratios (p> 0. 05). On the contrary, when compared in terms of postoperative complication, pain-free walking time and start date for going back to work, we observed that PT is more advantageous than LFT (p= 0, 00). We consider that PT can be prefered treatment method due to its acceptable relapse ratio, low postoperative complication ratio, good postoperative patient comfort, capability of performing repeated applications and constant availability of operation option...|$|E
