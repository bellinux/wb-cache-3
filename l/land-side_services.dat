The spatial extension of the airside is directly connected with {{the costs of the}} infrastructure and it is primarily determinate by the type of aircraft that uses the infrastructure and secondarily by the design expected traffic. The helicopter infrastructure is far smaller than that required for airplanes and seaplanes, since the first doesnâ€™t suffers the lateral wind on the approach and landing direction. On the other hand, the rotorcraft suffers operative costs largely high than the seaplane. This study aims to develop a methodology to compare the feasibility of helicopter and seaplane regular transport of passengers towards destinations across a remote regional tourist context. In order to identify the service users, the authors use the results of a modal split model identifying the quota of passengers that potentially could use these two type of services, determined on the basis of previous studies on air transport demand. After the identification of the potential users, a technical analysis regarding transport supply is performed to identify the predominant features that should characterize helicopter/seaplane performances. The analysis focuses on capacity, fuel consumption and total cost per kilometre (taking account of fixed, variable and commercial costs together with those relative to labour force ATC and <b>land-side</b> <b>services,</b> flight infrastructure costs), but also on whether conditions that influence greatly the performance of fixed wing aircrafts. Subsequently an optimization model is applied to identify the routes that could overcome the breakeven point considering each of the two means of transport. Finally, the inference on the results allows drawing conclusions on the importance of each type of service and on the influence on it of flight infrastructure costs...|$|E
5000|$|America's Marine Highway is a United States Department of Transportation (DOT) initiative, {{aimed to}} use the United States' 29000 mi of navigable {{waterways}} to alleviate traffic and wear to the nation's highways caused by tractor trailer traffic. [...] In 2007 Congress included provisions to Public Law 110-140, to 'Offer a waterborne alternative to available <b>land-side</b> transportation <b>services</b> using documented Vessels' and 'Provide transportation services for passengers or freight (or both) that may reduce congestion on land-side infrastructure using documented vessels.'As the United States' population grows, its need to transport freight within its borders also grows. This increases the need for fossil fuels and damages the nation's highways. It is estimated that in 2008, 3.7 billion hours were lost and 2.3 e9usgal L of fuel were spent in traffic jams by Americans. [...] Alongside grassroots efforts to reduce this congestion and greenhouse gas, such as the idea of 'buying local,' {{the federal government is}} looking to its navigable waterways to help alleviate the problem.|$|R
