40|$|Lone parent {{families}} are often portrayed as welfare-dependent, and social policies {{and social services}} can be hostile to and discriminating against lone parents especially in societies dominated by traditional familism, such as Hong Kong. This resentment of lone parent families has not been present throughout Hong Kong's history, but has arisen over the past decade. This paper {{is based on a}} study that traced the changing discourses of the <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> in Hong Kong. Adopting the Foucauldian concept of genealogy of knowledge and inspired by Nancy Fraser and Linda Gordon's work on "genealogy of dependency", we trace the discourses of the <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> from the 1970 s to the early 21 st century. The term "lone parent" did not exist before the mid- 1980 s, and when it first appeared it was closely associated with vulnerability and charity. In the early 21 st century, the lone parent discourse developed into a problematic discourse, with lone parents associated with welfare dependency, social security fraud, juvenile delinquency, family violence, and perceived as a threat to social stability. This paper notes that the "success" of this discourse may help to rationalize the cutting back of social security benefits for lone mothers and regulate welfare recipients.

40|$|Children {{living in}} reconstituted and lone parent {{families}} are {{at greater risk}} of poorer socio-emotional wellbeing than those in couple families. A life course approach can help us to understand the dynamics of family structure and how they influence child wellbeing, through consideration of sensitive and critical periods, accumulation, and trajectories of stability or change. We do this using data on 10, 357 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study from infancy to middle childhood. Family structure (natural couple, lone parent, reconstituted family) was measured at 9 months, 3, 5 and 7 years. We used a structured life course approach to examine how family structure might influence socio-emotional wellbeing throughout childhood. We also considered the role of early-life selection, and cumulative poverty (number of sweeps spent in income poverty). We found no evidence of sensitive or critical periods for exposure to certain family types. A measure capturing trajectories of family structure stability or change was as predictive of socio-emotional wellbeing at age 7 as a saturated measure representing all permutations of family structure over time. Compared to children living in a natural couple family throughout, all other groups were more likely to experience poor socio-emotional wellbeing, although children who were living in a natural couple family which transitioned to a <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> had a lower prevalence ratio (PR 1. 80 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 54, 2. 10]) than the other trajectory types, such as <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> throughout (PR= 2. 77 [2. 34, 3. 29]), or a <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> which transitioned to a reconstituted family (2. 66 [1. 99, 3. 56]). Number of sweeps spent in a lone parent or reconstituted family was also as predictive of poor socio-emotional wellbeing as the saturated model, with the elevated risk increasing incrementally with every sweep spent in either of these family types (PR= 1. 86 [1. 52, 2. 26]) for 1 sweep, rising to 2. 87 [2. 46, 3. 56] for 4). The association between both family structure measures and socio-emotional wellbeing were, in most cases, substantially attenuated after adjustment for early-life selection factors (such as maternal social class and separation of the mother’s parents in childhood) and cumulative poverty throughout childhood. This analysis confirms that policies to provide support to vulnerable families in the early years and to reduce poverty are likely to benefit child wellbeing...|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of streaming {{in the primary}} school (where children are placed in a class {{on the basis of}} measures of attainment and remain in that class all of the time) was commonplace when the 11 plus examination was used to select children for grammar school places. During the 1950 s and 1960 s the practice died out with most children being taught in mixed ability classes with some in-class grouping. During the 1990 s successive governments indicated that some form of ability grouping should be introduced in primary schools, setting (children placed in ability groups for some subjects and taught in mixed groups {{for the remainder of the}} time) being preferred, however, streaming was introduced in some schools despite evidence that movement between structured ability groups is infrequent and that children tend to remain in the same groups throughout their school careers limiting their educational opportunities. Recent research based on 8875 children, in the Millennium Cohort Study showed that 16. 4 % of children in Year 2 were in streamed classes. Logistic regression analysis showed that the best predictors of being in the top stream were whether the child was born in autumn or winter 2000, parents owning their own home, and the child’s cognitive ability score.

40|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{children in}} <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> face {{a high risk}} of poverty. A partial solution commonly sought in English-speaking nations is to increase the amounts of private child maintenance paid by the other <b>parent.</b> However, where <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> are in receipt of social assistance benefits, some countries hold back a portion of the child maintenance to reduce public expenditures. This partial &# 039;pass-through&# 039; treats child maintenance as a substitute for cash benefits which conceivably neutralises its poverty reduction potential. Such neutralising effects are not well understood and can be obscured further when more subtle interactions between child maintenance systems and social security systems operate. This research makes a unique contribution to knowledge by exposing the hidden interaction effects operating in similar child maintenance systems across four countries: the United Kingdom, United States (Wisconsin), Australia and New Zealand. We found that when child maintenance is counted as income in calculating benefit entitlements, it can reduce the value of cash benefits.

40|$|The general aims of this {{dissertation}} are {{to analyse}} how family situation, and especially lone parenting, influence health and life chances in Sweden {{and the extent}} to which possible relations are influenced by socioeconomic circumstances and health selection. In two population-based cohort studies we analysed overall and cause-specific mortality (1991 - 95), and also severe morbidity (1991 - 94) from different causes among lone mothers in comparison with mothers with partners. Information on the mothers was obtained from the Swedish Population and Housing censuses of 1985 and 1990. The outcomes considered were death or utilisation of (overnight) hospital care, with data taken from population-based national health registers. In the analyses we adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic circumstances, such as socioeconomic status, country of birth, receipt of social-welfare benefit, and housing situation. To take health-selection effects into account, we adjusted for previous inpatient history (1987 - 90). Our findings suggest that lone motherhood entails health disadvantages with regard to mortality, severe morbidity and injury. Socioeconomic circumstances were found to play a major role in accounting for increased risks, but the risks are partly independent of both socioeconomic conditions and health selection into lone motherhood. In two further studies we analysed mortality (1991 - 98), severe morbidity and injury (1991 - 99), and also educational achievement (in 1998 at ages 24 - 25 of offspring), of children who had lived in lone-parent families in comparison with children in two-parent families. We mainly used data from the Swedish censuses and national health-data registers. Living in a <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family</b> was found to be associated with increased risks of a variety of unfavourable outcomes: psychiatric disease, suicide/suicide attempt, injury, addiction, and low educational attainment. Relatively poor educational performance and also health disadvantages are explicable to a large extent by socioeconomic conditions, especially a lack of economic resources (as measured here by receipt of social-welfare benefit and having rented accommodation). Educational achievement among children varies with cause of lone parenthood, with the best prospects found among the children of widows/widowers. In a fifth study we analysed mortality from different causes (1991 - 2000) among lone fathers (fathers with and without custody of their children) and childless men (with and without partners) in comparison with cohabiting fathers with children in the household. For this purpose we linked information from the Swedish censuses of 1985 and 1990 to Sweden’s Multi-Generation Register (which contains information about all known biological relations between children and parents). Lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless men suffer from the most pronounced elevated risks, especially of death from injury or addiction, but also from all-cause mortality and death from ischaemic heart disease. Being a lone custodial father also seems to entail an increased mortality risk, although generally to a much lesser degree, and not for all outcomes studied. The elevated risks for all subgroups fell when variables assumed to control health selection and socioeconomic circumstances were introduced into the initial regression model employed. However, even following adjustments, significantly increased risks, albeit greatly attenuated, remained in all the subgroups investigated.

40|$|The {{last thirty}} years saw {{dramatic}} increases {{in the proportion of}} children living in <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> households. In 1997 the incoming Labour government initiated a series of policy reforms aimed at reducing this high level of child poverty. A key element of their strategy was a move towards increasing employment rates among families with children by a combination of increased in-work support through the Working Families Tax Credit and active case management of the population on welfare through the New Deal for <b>Lone</b> <b>Parents.</b> The assessment of this policy reform agenda has focused to date mainly on lone mothers’ employment and poverty. In this paper we extend this to include at the impact on the numbers of <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> and a range of outcomes for mothers and children. We cover mothers’ mental well-being and health, child outcomes and relationship patterns. As well as representing the basic facts about employment incomes and hours of work. Our results show there was no significant impact of these policy reforms on family structure. Mothers malaise scores are, unsurprisingly, very high on family break up but they tend to recover after around 2 years. WFTC is found to reduce the spike of high malaise co-incident with the transition into lone parenthood but to have no longer term effects. This decline in malaise is strongly associated with improved financial indicators. Adolescent children in <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> <b>families</b> report lower self-esteem, more unhappiness, lower quality relationships with the mother and a number of worse or risky behaviours. Difference-in-difference techniques suggest a marked narrowing if these gaps since WFTC. The magnitude of these changes are quite large, half of the gap in self-esteem and unhappiness scores and in truanting, smoking and planning to leave school at age 16 are eliminated after the policy reforms.

40|$|Executive summary In 2014, the 50 % of {{median income}} poverty {{line for a}} single adult was $ 426. 30 a week (or $ 343. 00 for income after housing costs). For a couple with {{children}} it was $ 895. 22 a week (or $ 720. 22 after housing). Using the after-housing poverty line, the headline poverty rate in 2014 is 13. 3 %, slightly lower than the 2012 rate (13. 9 %). Longerm analysis indicates an overall trend of persistent and entrenched poverty over the decade. Of most concern, there was a 2 % increase in child poverty from 2004 to 2014, with the trend most pronounced for children in <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families.</b> In international perspective, Australia’s poverty rate remains above the OECD average, despite our relative prosperity. In population terms, there were 2. 99 million people living {{below the poverty line}} after taking account of housing costs in 2014. The poverty rate for children remained significantly higher than for adults at 17. 4 %, affecting 731, 000 children. This was little changed from 2012 when the child poverty rate was 17. 7 %. Of concern, the child poverty rate for children in <b>lone</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> increased from 36. 8 % in 2012 to 40. 6 % in 2014. By <b>family</b> type, <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> experience the highest poverty rates at 33. 2 % and this has been a consistent trend throughout the decade. The rate of poverty for <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> has increased since 2012, a year in which 80, 000 sole parents were moved from pension to (much lower) allowance payments. Children in lone families are more than {{three times more likely to}} be living in poverty than their counterparts in couple families, with a poverty rate of 40. 6 % compared to 12. 5 %. The majority of people below the poverty line relied on social security as their main source of income (57. 3 %), but a significant proportion received wages as their main income (32 %). This division has not changed significantly from the previous reports, with wage earners comprising about a third of those in poverty in 2010 (29 %) and 2012 (33 %). While an overall minority of people receiving social security payments fell under the poverty line in 2014 (36. 1 %), a majority of Newstart (55 %) and Parenting Payment (51. 5 %) recipients were in this category. A number of social security payments fell significantly below the poverty line, including most notably the unemployment payment. For a single person with no children, Newstart in 2013 - 14 fell $ 109. 55 per week below the poverty line. Youth Allowance was even further below: for a single person with no children it fell $ 158. 63 per week below the poverty line.
