Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epsteinâ€“Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

25|$|The {{underlying}} mechanism typically involves histamine or bradykinin. The version {{related to}} histamine is to due {{an allergic reaction}} to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or a <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} {{surgical}} procedure, {{there are risks}} of bleeding and infection. The newly transplanted lung itself may fail to properly heal and function. Because {{a large portion of}} the patient's body has been exposed to the outside air, sepsis is a possibility, so antibiotics will be given to try to prevent that. Other complications include Post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorder, a form of lymphoma due to the immune suppressants, and gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{commonly}} used categories of {{white blood cell}} disorders divide them [...] into those causing excessive numbers (proliferative disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (leukopenias). Leukocytosis is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an infection), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. WBC proliferative disorders can be classed as myeloproliferative and <b>lymphoproliferative.</b> Some are autoimmune, but many are neoplastic.|$|E
2500|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 (HTLV-2) {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{in a small}} number of patients with the variant form of HCL. In the 1980s, HTLV-2 was identified in a patient with a T-cell <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disease; this patient later developed hairy cell leukemia (a B cell disease), but HTLV-2 was not found in the hairy cell clones. [...] There is no evidence that HTLV-II causes any sort of hematological malignancy, including HCL.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V), which shares some {{characteristics}} with B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), {{does not}} show CD25 (also called the Interleukin-2 receptor, alpha). [...] As this is relatively new and expensive technology, its adoption by physicians is not uniform, despite the advantages of comfort, simplicity, and safety for the patient when compared to a bone marrow biopsy. [...] The presence of additional <b>lymphoproliferative</b> diseases is easily checked during a flow cytometry test, where they characteristically show different results.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 a {{total of}} 50,417 first hematopoietic stem cell transplants were {{reported}} as taking place worldwide, according to a global survey of 1327 centers in 71 countries conducted by the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. [...] Of these, 28,901 (57 percent) were autologous and 21,516 (43 percent) were allogeneic (11,928 from family donors and 9,588 from unrelated donors). [...] The main indications for transplant were <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorders (54.5 percent) and leukemias (33.8 percent), and the majority took place in either Europe (48 percent) or the Americas (36 percent).|$|E
2500|$|Lymphomas in {{the strict}} sense are any {{neoplasms}} of the lymphatic tissues ( [...] + [...] ) [...] The main classes are malignant neoplasms (that is, cancers) of the lymphocytes, {{a type of}} white blood cell that belongs to both the lymph and the blood and pervades both. Thus, lymphomas and leukemias are both tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, and as <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorders, lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are closely related, to the point that some of them are unitary disease entities that can be called by either name (for example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).|$|E
2500|$|GSE, {{particularly}} coeliac disease, {{increases the}} risk of cancers of specific types. There are two predominant cancers associated with coeliac disease, cancer of the esophagus and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> diseases such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). For non-EATL cancers it is thought the mineralemias such as zinc and selenium {{may play a role in}} increasing risk. GSE associated cancers are invariably associated with advanced coeliac disease, however, in de-novo EATL, the cancer is frequently detected in advance of the coeliac diagnosis, also EATL [...] is the most common neoplasm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lymphoproliferative</b> {{disorders}} are {{a set of}} disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes into a monoclonal lymphocytosis. The two major types of lymphocytes are B cells and T cells, which are derived from pluripotent hematopoetic stem cells in the bone marrow. Individuals who {{have some sort of}} dysfunction with their immune system are susceptible to develop a <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorder because when any of the numerous control points of the immune system become dysfunctional, immunodeficiency or deregulation of lymphocytes is more likely to occur. There are several inherited gene mutations that have been identified to cause <b>lymphoproliferative</b> disorders; however, there are also acquired and iatrogenic causes.|$|E
