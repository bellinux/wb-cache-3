50|$|The {{precision}} {{to which}} a molar mass is known depends on the precision of the atomic masses from which it was calculated. Most atomic masses are known to a precision {{of at least one}} part in ten-thousand, often much better (the atomic mass of lithium is a notable, and serious, exception). This is adequate for almost all normal uses in chemistry: it is more precise than most chemical analyses, and exceeds the purity of most <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents.</b>|$|E
50|$|XMRV has {{now been}} {{established}} as a laboratory contaminant. False positive detection of XMRV may also occur because of contamination of clinical specimens and <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> with other mouse retroviruses or related nucleic acids. Most scientific publications claiming an association of XMRV with CFS or prostate cancer have been retracted, and allegations of research misconduct were leveled against at least one CFS investigator. There {{is no evidence that}} XMRV can infect humans, nor has it been demonstrated that XMRV is associated with or causes any human disease.|$|E

50|$|The study {{involved}} 6,596 people from Evans County and 3,921 people from Bulloch County. The study population from Evans county consisted of African-American and Caucasian males, ages 40-74, {{along with a}} 15-39 year old group that were involved in other studies. Then, the people were divided up into 10 random, equal in size, random samples. Also, a 50% random sample of the 15-39 year old group was taken by including people from the first five samples solely. By comprising this type of sampling, secular trends in disease patterns, along with possible aging of <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> were randomized.|$|E

5000|$|The {{editors at}} Science in May 2011 {{requested}} that {{the authors of the}} 2009 Lombardi et al. study retract the article due to many independent studies that did not find an association of XMRV with CFS, and studies that have presented data showing contaminated <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> may have led to false positive results. Science reported that Mikovits declined the request on behalf of the original authors, labeled the request [...] "premature", and asserted that the original study results were accurate. The editor-in-chief of the journal Science subsequently published an expression of concern, [...] "Because the validity of the study by Lombardi et al. is now seriously in question". In December 2011, Science retracted the 2009 paper.|$|E

5000|$|Nigeria {{was struck}} {{especially}} hard, with 562 deaths in 9,086 cases. 333 deaths {{occurred in the}} country over a three-month period in twenty-two out of thirty-six states. 217 Local Government Areas also reported cases. Several states mounted large meningitis vaccination and information campaigns after the outbreak. Babatunde Osotimehin, the Nigerian Minister of Health said that his nation was prepared for the expected epidemic: [...] "On 3rd September 2008, we alerted all the States in the meningitis belt to intensify surveillance, preposition drugs and laboratory materials and sensitise the public on preventive measures.

50|$|The {{results of}} several studies support the {{contamination}} hypothesis. Scientists {{reported that they}} found ample sources of contamination in <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents,</b> tissue samples and blood. Samples that were positive for XMRV were also positive for mouse DNA contaminants. Another article reported on the striking identity of XMRV genomic sequences and their similarity to xenotropic MLVs in several human cell lines. The authors conclude that XMRV contaminated 22Rv1 cell cultures, likely during passage in athymic mice. (Production of laboratory cell lines may involve passaging of tumours in mice.) Identical XMRV integration sites were also found, a phenomenon never before reported for a retrovirus and strongly suggestive of contamination. It has been recommended that studies of XMRV should include more diverse and stringent PCR testing and phylogenetic analysis to detect occurrence of mouse DNA contamination from laboratory sources.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{were concerned about}} contamination from the first reports of XMRV-disease associations, and these concerns spread as study after study failed to replicate WPI's results. In December, 2010, four independent articles {{published in the journal}} Retrovirology presented evidence that reported XMRV detection could be explained by contamination of <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents,</b> tissue samples and blood. Samples that were positive for XMRV were also positive for mouse DNA contaminants. Furthermore, the striking identity of XMRV genomic sequences and their similarity to xenotropic MLVs in several human cell lines suggested that XMRV is not a transmissible human pathogen. The British Medical Journal responded with an article entitled, [...] "Chronic fatigue syndrome is not caused by XMRV virus, study shows". A fifth study supporting the contamination hypothesis was published in February, 2011, just ahead of the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). At CROI, WPI representatives were absent, and a large amount of negative data was presented. Two groups showed evidence that XMRV is a recombinant of two mouse retroviruses, which infected a prostate cancer cell line during passage through nude mice. Virologist John Coffin, who had previously expressed optimism about the initial WPI data, declared, [...] "It's all contamination." [...] Robert Silverman, who was a co-author of the original XMRV-CFS article but is no longer collaborating with Mikovits, told the Chicago Tribune that he was [...] "concerned about lab contamination, despite our best efforts to avoid it".|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{supplies}} of tuberculosis <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> and consumables {{are necessary for}} tuberculosis diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response. This study assessed the distribution and stock levels of laboratory commodities used in tuberculosis control in health centers of Amhara region, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 82 health centers, among 801, providing sputum microscopy services. Stock levels were calculated, and distribution of reagents and consumables assessed. Thirty three (40. 2 %) health centers were under stocked for {{at least one of the}} key items for tuberculosis diagnosis at the time of visit. Fifteen (18. 3 %) health centers had no stocks of at least one of the key items (methylene blue (11 %), carbol fuchsin (11 %), acid alcohol (8. 5 %) and sputum cups (3. 7 %)). Of the 82 health centers, 77 (93. 9 %) did not fulfill the criteria for effective distribution of tuberculosis <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> and consumables. There were many health centers that had no or only low stocks of key tuberculosis <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> and consumables as a result of ineffective distribution system. It is necessary to strengthen supply chain management to ensure uninterrupted TB diagnostic service...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{study of}} {{microbial}} communities has been revolutionised {{in recent years}} by the widespread adoption of culture independent analytical techniques such as 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. One potential confounder of these sequence-based approaches is the presence of contamination in DNA extraction kits and other <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents.</b> RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits and other <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents,</b> varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Contamination impacts both PCR-based 16 S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised...|$|E
