40|$|This thesis studies women politicians’ journey {{along the}} path from {{candidates}} to elected representatives in party list proportional representation (PR <b>list)</b> <b>systems.</b> While past literature provides sufficient evidence that more women are elected in proportional electoral systems than in majority / plurality systems, there is limited research explaining the differences in women’s representation across varying types of PR <b>list</b> <b>systems.</b> This thesis aims to fill that gap, by focusing primarily on the election of women across preferential (open and ordered <b>list</b> <b>systems)</b> and non-preferential (closed <b>list</b> <b>systems)</b> PR <b>list</b> voting <b>systems.</b> Moreover, unlike {{the vast majority of}} previous research, which has relied on aggregate level data only, this research investigates the election of women at the individual candidate level. Such an approach allows the present thesis to consider, next to traditional aggregate level predictors, how party gatekeepers and the news media may either support or hinder women in progressing from candidates to elected representatives. Since the focus is set on the 2009 European Parliament elections, this thesis investigates the process of electing women cross-nationally. The results show that female candidates have a higher likelihood of being elected in non-preferential closed <b>list</b> voting <b>systems</b> than in preferential ordered <b>list</b> voting <b>systems.</b> The results suggest that this is the case because, first, party gatekeepers in ordered <b>list</b> <b>systems</b> place women in less viable electoral list positions than party gatekeepers in closed list systems; second, media cover female candidates less in ordered <b>list</b> <b>systems</b> compared to closed list systems; and finally, female candidates in ordered <b>list</b> <b>systems</b> fail to make up their less competitive starting position with preference votes because preference votes in ordered <b>list</b> <b>systems</b> do not significantly alter the initial party list rankings.

500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a <b>list</b> <b>system.</b> Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E

40|$|Legal Reform, Discourses and Impacts’, gender quotas {{have been}} {{relatively}} successful in Peruvian municipal and congressional elections. These successes were unanticipated for two reasons. First, during the congressional debates virtually no {{attention was paid to}} how quotas would work in conjunction with the very different rules that are used in the two types of elections. Second, the positive impact of gender quotas in Peru was also unanticipated in the academic literature on electoral systems. Indeed, the success of gender quotas in Peruvian municipal and congressional elections actually contradicts much of the conventional wisdom in electoral studies. In this paper, I first review the current thinking in the academic literature on the implications of open versus closed <b>list</b> <b>systems</b> and other key variables for the election of women. I then explain why gender quotas worked better than anticipated in Peruvian municipal and congressional elections.

2500|$|On 14 June 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt {{ruled that}} the {{election}} was unconstitutional, and {{one third of the}} winners were illegitimate. The ruling was due, in part, to the fact that some seats were contested on a proportional <b>list</b> <b>system,</b> while others were contested on the first-past-the-post system. [...] As a result, the court concluded, the election law had allowed political parties to compete for seats intended for independent candidates. [...] "The makeup of the entire chamber is illegal and, consequently, it does not legally stand", explained the court. The ruling upheld a lower court decision, which had found the election law unconstitutional. [...] The Muslim Brotherhood held the majority of the seats ruled unconstitutional.|$|E

2500|$|Mixed member {{proportional}} representation (MMP) is a two-tier system that combines a single-district vote, usually first-past-the-post, with a compensatory regional or nationwide party list proportional vote. The system aims {{to combine the}} local district representation of FPTP and the proportionality of a national party <b>list</b> <b>system.</b> MMP {{has the potential to}} produce proportional or moderately proportional election outcomes, depending on a number of factors such as the ratio of FPTP seats to PR seats, the existence or nonexistence of extra compensatory seats to make up for overhang seats, and election thresholds. It was invented for the German Bundestag after the Second World War and has spread to Lesotho, Bolivia and New Zealand.

2500|$|The term STV in Australia {{refers to}} the Senate electoral system, a variant of Hare-Clark {{characterized}} by the [...] "above the line" [...] group voting ticket, a party list option. [...] It {{is used in the}} Australian upper house, the Senate, and some state upper houses. [...] Due to the number of preferences that are compulsory if a vote for candidates (below-the-line) is to be valid for the Senate a minimum of 90% of candidates must be scored, in 2013 in New South Wales that meant writing 99 preferences on the ballot 95% and more of voters use the above-the-line option, making the system, in all but name, a party <b>list</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Parties determine the order in which candidates are elected and also control transfers to other lists and this has led to anomalies: preference deals between parties, and [...] "micro parties" [...] which rely entirely on these deals. [...] Additionally, independent candidates are unelectable unless they form, or join, a group above-the-line. [...] Concerning the development of STV in Australia researchers have observed: [...] "... we see real evidence {{of the extent to which}} Australian politicians, particularly at national levels, are prone to fiddle with the electoral system".|$|E
2500|$|PR {{tries to}} resolve the {{unfairness}} of majoritarian and plurality voting systems where the largest parties receive an [...] "unfair" [...] "seat bonus" [...] and smaller parties are disadvantaged and have difficulty winning any representation at all (Duverger's law). The established parties in UK elections can win formal control of the parliament with as little as 35% of votes (2005 UK general election). In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties {{with the support of}} under 40% of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60%, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate to vote for it. [...] In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6% of the total electorate. [...] Such misrepresentation has been criticized as [...] "no longer a question of 'fairness' but of elementary rights of citizens". [...] However, PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the Turkish general election, 2002, using an open <b>list</b> <b>system</b> with a 10% threshold, 46% of votes were wasted.|$|E
