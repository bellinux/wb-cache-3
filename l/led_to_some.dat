5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} {{the presidency of}} the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was {{the presidency of the}} Oxford Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence.

5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups.

This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
