40|$|An {{electron}} gun producing an e-beam with high-brightness and high-average current {{is a key}} component to realize a next-generation X-ray light source based on an energy-recovery linac (ERL). In JAEA, we are developing a photocathode DC gun for a future ERL light source. The DC gun is operated at 250 kV and 50 mA at maximum, and equipped with a <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber</b> for cathode prepa-ration. In order to keep small emittance at high current op-eration, we adopt new type of semiconductor photocathode such as AlGaAs and superlattice. In this paper, we present {{the status of the}} gun development and future plans towards the ERL test facility to construct in collaboration with KEK and other institutes...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high {{performance}} plasma discharges in the DIII-D magnetic fusion tokamak, impurity levels must be carefully controlled. Since first wall materials can desorb volatile impurities during these discharges, {{it is important to}} characterize and control the outgassing of these materials. An outgassing chamber was built to measure the outgassing properties of various materials used in the DIII-D vessel. The results of pump-down tests performed on ATJ graphite, thin Grafoil {reg_sign} gaskets, and MgO coaxial cables will be presented. In addition to pumpdown tests it was desired to study the behavior of the materials at temperatures up to 400 C, which is the maximum temperature to which the DIII-D vessel is baked. The station was modified to include independent heating control of the sample and a simple <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber...</b>|$|E
40|$|A multiple-tip {{ultra-high vacuum}} (UHV) {{scanning}} tunneling microscope (MT-STM) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for imaging and molecular-beam epitaxy growth capabilities has been developed. This instrument (nanoworkbench) is used to perform four-point probe conductivity measurements at micrometer spatial dimension. The system is composed of four chambers, the multiple-tip STM/SEM chamber, a surface analysis and preparation chamber, a molecular-beam epitaxy chamber and a <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber</b> for fast transfer of samples and probes. The four chambers are interconnected by a unique transfer system based on a sample box with integrated heating and temperature-measuring capabilities. We demonstrate the operation {{and the performance of}} the nanoworkbench with STM imaging on graphite and with four-point-probe conductivity measurements on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) crystal. The creation of a local FET, whose dimension and localization are respectively determined by the spacing between the probes and their position on the SOI surface, is demonstrated. Comment: 39 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the compatibility of Cl 2 /BCl 3 /IBr 3 etch gas mixtures with a cryo-pumped ultrahigh vacuum chemically assisted ion-beam etching system. The machine was designed for the fabrication of ultrahigh-quality laser facets in monolithically integrated GaAs- and InP-based optoelectronic integrated circuits. The chemical composition of etch byproducts deposited in the vacuum chambers and the pumping system has been examined in particular detail. After 70 h of process time, samples of such deposits were scraped from the chamber walls and the various stages of the cryo-pump and roughing pump; these samples were analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray measurements. Automated overnight regeneration of the cryopump, the use of integrated external bakeout heaters, and {{the implementation of a}} cryo-pumped <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber</b> allow the deposition of reactive Cl-containing residues to be confined to surfaces and components which can be cleaned or replaced during routinely scheduled yearly maintenance...|$|E
30|$|The {{custom made}} PLD system (AOV Ltd) {{consisted}} of a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of about 10 − 6 Pa, equipped with a <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> The target carousel can hold up to six targets, and a stainless steel shield reduces cross contamination during the ablation process. Each target can simultaneously rotate and oscillate allowing a uniform ablation of the target surface. A KrF excimer laser (Coherent Lambda Physik GmbH) with a wavelength of 248  nm and a pulse width of 25  ns {{was focused on the}} target material in a spot area of about 5  mm 2. The energy of the laser shots onto the target surface was set at about 160  mJ. A laser repetition rate between 2 and 5  Hz was used. The deposition of the films was carried out in an oxygen background pressure ranging from 0.5 to 5  Pa, at a substrate temperature of about 700  °C. The target-to-substrate distance was 75  mm.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} six months, this project was focused on more {{fundamental}} studies of the coating properties. The properties of each individual coating TiB{sub 2 }, TiBC {{as well as the}} alternating TiB{sub 2 }/TiBC laminates were studied. These properties include residual stress, surface morphology and topography, adhesion and wear rate. The coatings were deposited using dc magnetron reactive sputtering process. Deposition of the films was carried out in a production-scale, three-chamber-in-line coating system, consisting of a <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> and two deposition chambers. The substrates were cleaned and mounted on a rack before going into the chamber. A computerized conveyor system transported the rack into the <b>load-lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> where the pressure was pumped down to around 2 E- 5 torr. The substrates were then preheated by an infrared heater to about 100 C. After preheating, the substrates were transported into the first deposition chamber through a gate valve. The base pressure of the deposition chambers is 2 E- 6 torr. A layer of Ti was deposited on the substrates using two 5 inch x 20 inch Ti targets in the first deposition chamber as the adhesion layer. The substrates were then transported to the second deposition chamber for the TiB{sub 2 } and Ti-B-C-N depositions. In the second deposition chamber, two 5 inch x 20 inch TiB{sub 2 } targets were mounted on both sides. For the TiB{sub 2 } deposition, argon was introduced into the chamber. For the Ti-B-C-N deposition, acetylene and nitrogen were introduced into the chamber through four gas distribution manifolds to insure the uniformity. The partial pressure of the reactive gases were controlled by a PID control loop. Substrate bias {{is one of the key}} deposition parameters. Bias voltages ranged from 40 to 300 V. Current density is around 2 mA/cm{sup 2 }. The deposition rate is about 1. 5 {micro}m/hr. All the test coatings, used for thickness and hardness measurement, as well as, microstructural studies, were deposited on polished 001 silicon wafers. All the coatings used for wear tests, were deposited on polished 1 inch stainless steel 316 disks...|$|E

In addition a doping technol-ogy using an intermittent supply of Si 2 H 6 and a dopant precursor, PH 3 ~or B 2 H 6) for n-type ~or p-type!, epitaxial growth {{has been applied to}} achieve heavily doped abrupt structures to satisfy the demand for Si nanostructure devices. Experimental Figure 1 shows the system employed and the gas injection se-quence for Si MLE along with the doping method.

The temperature monitored by the pyrometer was cali-brated using a Pt-Pt Rh ~ 13 %! thermocouple.
