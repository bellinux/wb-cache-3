25|$|Benny's comic persona {{changed over}} the course of his career. At some point he {{developed}} a miserly persona. This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly written show. Oh wait, it is." ...|$|E

[...] Roch Parisien of Allmusic cited the song {{as one of the}} three stand-outs from Yankovic's second greatest hits volume, and called it a [...] "rib-tickler". Tina Maps of The Milwaukee Journal wrote a positive review and felt that the musical parody was a [...] "dead-on skewering of the Crash Test Dummies' 'Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm". Not all reviews, however, were so positive; an article that appeared in The Commercial Appeal noted that while the video for [...] "Headline News" [...] had some [...] "cute bits and unusual cameos", it was [...] "not as clever as many of Yankovic's past efforts" [...] and that [...] "the current events included here are already dated".|$|E

500|$|This {{story is}} about a king who wants to keep all magic to himself. To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom {{and he has to}} learn magic. He creates a [...] "Brigade of Witch Hunters" [...] and calls for an {{instructor}} in magic. Only a [...] "cunning charlatan" [...] with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a few simple tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the king's washerwoman, <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> king one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and warns that the charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration.|$|E

He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, it is {{revealed}} [...] "Homer Simpson" [...] {{is the only}} thing Mr. Burns can say, suggesting his [...] "accusation" [...] may not have actually been one. Hoping to clear Homer's name, Lisa returns {{to the scene of the}} crime to investigate and discovers the identity of Mr. Burns' true assailant. At the same time, Homer arrives at the hospital to confront Mr. Burns and demand his boss exonerate him, despite being impressed that Mr. Burns finally remembered his name. After a police bulletin reports Homer's location, the police, Lisa, and many other citizens of Springfield race to the hospital. Upon entering Mr. Burns' room, everyone finds an enraged Homer vigorously shaking Mr. Burns, demanding he take back his accusation. Homer shaking him returns Mr. Burns' ability to speak normally, and he quickly asks who the person shaking him is. Apoplectic with fury at Mr. Burns again not remembering who he is, Homer aims Wiggum's gun at Mr. Burns' face, demanding he recant his accusations. Mr. Burns <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea and confirms Homer did not shoot him. He then reveals the true assailant: Maggie.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after meeting}} Wind, Jonathan and Charlotte {{find one of}} Brauner's magical portraits. [...] Unable to destroy it from outside, the two travel into the world within. [...] Soon, they find Brauner's channeler, a Dullahan. [...] Shortly after its defeat, one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts, saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree. [...] Later, when {{entering}} the second portrait, they find Brauner and the two twins; Brauner <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> notion of reviving Dracula, as he has failed too many times to control humanity, but concedes his power is too great to ignore. [...] Both sisters desire to kill the two humans, but Brauner sees Dracula's servant Death as a greater threat, as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them. [...] While exploring the castle, Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death, who acts as if Dracula were already revived. [...] When informed Dracula is still dead, and that another vampire is controlling the castle, he scoffs {{at the idea of}} a hand other than Dracula's to rule Castlevania. [...] Yet, he is gravely disturbed when he sees the statements are true, and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy Brauner and revive Dracula.|$|E

He is given a minor map-making command as punishment for refusing the greater post. He draws up plans for an invasion of Italy. In Nice, [...] (Alexandre Mathillon) sees the plans and <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foolhardy proposal. The plans are sent back, and Napoleon pastes them up to cover a broken window in the poor apartment he shares with Captain Marmont (Pierre de Canolle), Sergeant Junot (Jean Henry) and the actor Talma (Roger Blum). Napoleon and Junot see the contrast of cold, starving people outside of wealthy houses.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Long, {{reviewing}} {{the first season}} DVD for DVD Town, praised the series for its cast and the educational value of the items examined, calling it [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "a big-time winner", and opined {{that it is the}} best show on History and perhaps cable. In one issue of TV Guide, writer Rob Moynihan included the show in a list of [...] "guilty pleasures." [...] April McIntyre of Monsters and Critics, whose negative view of pawn shops influenced her view of the series' setting, reviewed one episode of the series, which she labeled a [...] "cool Antiques Roadshow". Though she found aspects of it interesting, she criticized what she perceived as an emphasis on cheap <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of family patriarch Richard Harrison over the show's historical material, as well as Corey Harrison's weight. She ultimately saw potential for the series if aspects of it that she found to be in poor taste were curbed. USA Todays Gary Strauss opined that the bickering among the Harrisons, as well as the customers seen in the shop, is [...] "alternately amusing and grating". People magazine wrote of the show, [...] "Think Antiques Roadshow, but with neon and far more tattoos." [...] Some of History's viewers were reportedly displeased with how reality series like Pawn Stars and Swamp People have replaced some of the network's previous history-oriented programming.|$|E
