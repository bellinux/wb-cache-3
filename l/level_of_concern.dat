5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the {{increased}} threat of conflict with Nazi Germany amplified the Canadian government's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> {{for the general}} safety of the memorial. Canada could {{do little more than}} protect the sculptures and the bases of the pylons with sandbags and await developments. When war did break out in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) deployed to France and assumed responsibility for the Arras sector, which included Vimy. In late May 1940, following the British retreat to Dunkirk after the Battle of Arras, the status and condition of the memorial became unknown to Allied forces. The Germans took control of the site and held the site's caretaker, George Stubbs, in an Ilag internment camp for Allied civilians in St. Denis, France. The rumoured destruction of the Vimy Memorial, either during the fighting or {{at the hands of the}} Germans, was widely reported in Canada and the United Kingdom. The rumours led the German Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to formally deny accusations that Germany had damaged or desecrated the memorial. To demonstrate the memorial had not been desecrated, Adolf Hitler, who reportedly admired the memorial for its peaceful nature, was photographed by the press while personally touring it and the preserved trenches on 2 June 1940. The undamaged state of the memorial was not confirmed until September 1944 when British troops of the 2nd Battalion, Welsh Guards of the Guards Armoured Division recaptured Vimy Ridge.|$|E

This study assesses {{the extent to}} which the NIMBY label and the strategies of industry proponents to reduce opposition function on a reasonable set of assumptions. Using survey data and multiple regression techniques, the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> residents living in the county selected as the site <b>of</b> a low <b>level</b> radioactive wane disposal facility (imminent threat condition) are compared with a statewide sample (hypothetical threat condition).

However, within the host county, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> are lowest, albeit most polarized, in the community closest to the proposed site. A conflict theory approach enhances an understanding of these findings by suggesting that within the most proximate community <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> are lowest for citizens who stand to gain the most economic benefits from the facility but highest for those citizens who are least likely to derive tangible gains...|$|R

40|$|The knowledge-deficit theory {{suggests}} that if people are not concerned about climate change, it is {{because there is a}} deficit in their knowledge of climate change—they do not properly comprehend the scientific consensus. So do people with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about climate change feel more concerned than those with lower knowledge levels? Existing research has been inconclusive but suggests differences between perceived and actual knowledge. This thesis comprises two studies. Study 1 tests the effect of perceived knowledge on concern for climate change with a nationally representative, randomly selected sample of 269 New Zealanders. Study 2 tests the effect of actual knowledge about climate change on concern with a sample of 452 New Zealanders recruited via snowball sampling. Results supported the knowledge-deficit theory for concern for climate change, but only when actual knowledge was tested. Participants in both Study 1 and Study 2 with high perceived knowledge did not have correspondingly high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> but Study 2 participants with high actual knowledge of climate change did also have high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b> Other variables tested that consistently predicted high concern for climate change were perceived efficacy (the perception that one's actions will influence group outcomes) and environmental values. Demographic variables were not strong or consistent predictors <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> but overall, younger female participants tended to display higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> than older male participants...|$|R

Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of delusional intensity, it is argued that considering the condition as a form of delusional disorder, as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that the odor was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that the odor was not existent.|$|E

The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand and the Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Board considered the concession was questionably processed by the Department of Conservation. The concession permit (granted to Wingnut Films Limited) incorrectly allowed activities, such as fantasy filming and vehicles off roads at Tongariro National Park, that were not consistent with park management plans. The ecological significance of an internationally important wetland was ignored. The process was rushed through without public involvement in spite expressions of concern from the Tongariro Taupo Conservation Board. Considerations of effects and their mitigation were not rigorous. The process facilitated access to public conservation lands for a large-scale operation that ultimately {{had nothing to do}} with conservation purposes the Department of Conservation is required to promote.|$|E

40|$|This survey {{examined}} {{public opinion}} regarding self-driving-vehicle technology in three major English-speaking countries—the U. S., the U. K., and Australia. The survey yielded useable responses from 1, 533 persons 18 years and older. The main findings (applicable {{to each of}} the three countries) were as follows: The majority of respondents had previously heard of autonomous or self-driving vehicles, had a positive initial opinion of the technology, and had high expectations about the benefits of the technology. However, the majority of respondents expressed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> about riding in self-driving vehicles, security issues related to self-driving vehicles, and self-driving vehicle not performing as well as actual drivers. Respondents also expressed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> about vehicles without driver controls; self-driving vehicles moving while unoccupied; and self-driving commercial vehicles, busses, and taxis. The majority of respondents expressed a desire to have this technology in their vehicle. However, a majority was also unwilling to pay extra for the technology; those who were willing to pay offered similar amounts in each country. Females expressed higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> with self-driving vehicles than did males. Similarly, females were more cautious about their expectations concerning benefits from using self-driving vehicles. In comparison to the respondents in the U. K. and Australia, respondents in the U. S. expressed greater concern about riding in self-driving vehicles, data privacy, interacting with non-self-driving vehicles, self-driving vehicles not driving as well as human drivers in general, and riding in a self-driving vehicle with no driver controls available. The main implications of these results are that motorists and the general public in the three countries surveyed, while expressing high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> about riding in vehicles equipped with this technology, feel positive about self-driving vehicles, have optimistic expectations of the benefits, and generally desire self-driving-vehicle technology when it becomes available (though a majority is not willing to pay extra for such technology at this time) ...|$|R
