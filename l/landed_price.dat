An Excel spreadsheet is provided with sample boat costs and revenues. The spreadsheet allows the trawler owner/operator to enter costs and revenues data for their own vessel. This {{can be used to}} estimate average costs of landing a pound of shrimp by the vessel owner/operator and the profit (loss) per pound of landed shrimp. As input costs vary for key items like fuel, ice, BRDS, etc, the trawler owner can estimate the impact of these input costs on the total average cost of landing a pound of shrimp. Similarly, as the ex-vessel (<b>landed)</b> <b>price</b> for a pound of shrimp changes, the vessel owner/operator can estimate the impact of these price changes on the profitability of operating the trawler.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneLand is a {{fundamental}} input in agricultural production and the factors affecting <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are an important topic in agricultural economics research. The farmland market has several unique characteristics. <b>Land</b> <b>price</b> volatility can {{be a source of}} problems for farmers and investors, especially in periods of falling prices in locations far from markets where the impact of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> reductions is higher than in other locations. This study analyzes <b>land</b> <b>price</b> volatility in different geographical regions of Brazil. The hypothesis is that variation in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increases with the distance to the market, indicating that <b>land</b> <b>price</b> changes will be more pronounced in areas far from markets and the effects of <b>price</b> cycles in <b>land</b> markets will increase as distance from the market increases. The results obtained in this research support the hypothesis that areas far from end markets are exposed to greater changes in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> and those same areas are more susceptible to price cycles. The effect on price volatility was also stronger in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> declines. These regions have greater incentives for expansion and investment in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increase and greater risks of disinvestment and failure in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> contraction.

40|$|The {{manner in}} which the <b>landed</b> <b>price</b> of imports affects {{domestic}} prices is central to trade policy analysis. This study clarifies the relationship between two methods of modelling this relationship. These are the pass-through elasticity and the 'Armington' elasticity of substitution in demand between imported and domestically produced goods. The latter treatment is commonly used within applied general equilibrium models. The properties of the models are sensitive to the assumed values of these elasticities, but empirical estimates of Armington elasticities are rare. The theoretical relationship between the pass-through elasticity and the Armington elasticity is derived from a simple supply and demand model which incorporates Armingtion assumptions. The relationship is then illustrated empirically in the context of rice imports into Indonesia. Even though imported and domestically produced rice are considered relatively close substitutes in demand within Indonesia, time series econometric estimates of the pass-through elasticity imply Armington elasticities no greater than about 5. The Armington elasticities implied by the estimates of the pass-through elasticity presented here are well within the range of parameter estimates normally assumed within applied general equilibrium models. ...|$|E
40|$|The Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) {{restricts the}} access of {{developing}} country exporters to developed country markets. It is usually {{assumed that the}} exporting countries receive all of the economic rents that result from these import restrictions - making it unclear whether the developing countries gain or lose {{as a result of}} the MFA. Recent theoretical work on trade policy under imperfect competition casts doubt on whether exporting countries receive all of the quota rents arising from voluntary export restraints such as those applied by the MFA. Drawing on this theoretical literature, Erzan, Krishna, and Tan (1991) tested and rejected the hypothesis that MFA quota rents on exports from Hong Kong to the United States accrued in full to the Hong Kong exporters. The results in this paper build on that hypothesis-testing analysis and assess its implications for the returns to Hong Kong producers. Their results suggest that rent sharing is an extremely important feature of the market for apparel exports from Hong Kong. U. S. importers were estimated to receive rents that were about 62 percent of the <b>landed</b> <b>price</b> of the imports. The authors conclude that the total potential rents arising from the MFA were split unevenly between the U. S. and Hong Kong - with the U. S. share ranging from 47 percent for skirts to 94 percent for playsuits. If the results of this study are corroborated for other developing countries, the implications of the MFA for developing countries are considerably worse than has typically been assumed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the way uncertainty plays a role in built <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> This paper provides basic real option <b>pricing</b> models of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> on the demand side in central Tokyo. The model in this research analyzes micro <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> covering individual lot data provided by the <b>Land</b> <b>Price</b> Index. Since <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are determined by both macro economic environment and micro lot-specific attributes, this paper utilizes both time-series economic data and cross-sectional lot-specific data. The model incorporates both time-series (macro) and cross-sectional (micro) data including uncertainty terms. In addition to the total uncertainty in asset prices, this research also gives some ideas of cross-sectional uncertainty in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> variations by utilizing cross-sectional amenity variables. These cross-sectional and time-series variables including these two uncertainty variables are pooled and the OLS method is conducted. The data set consists of 4, 368 <b>land</b> <b>price</b> data from 1985 through 2000. The results from the option-based models favor the application of the real option theory in <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> The total uncertainty with respect to built asset return has a substantial effect on increasing <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> which implies that an increase in uncertainty leads to an increase in <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> by Ritsuko Yamazaki.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the later Taisho period was conditioned by farm rent and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price,</b> based on the premises of constant return to scale and the supported price of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period.

As for the result of the analysis, it is summarized as follows. <b>Land</b> <b>prices</b> in Japan decreased all together in 1992. The reorganization process of the regional structure is reflected in the feature that is pointed out to the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations for 16 years until 2008. The decline in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in the Tokyo metropolitan area in the early 1990 â€™s was caused by overestimation to commercial area having been corrected. This decline was a nationwide phenomenon, and didnâ€™t have a regional difference. But, in the later 1990 â€™s, a relative difference between Tokyo wards and the other regions had expanded because the fall rate in Tokyo wards had decreased. This tendency became clearer by the increase of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Tokyo wards in the early 2000 â€™s. Though a relative or absolute increase of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in Tokyo wards means progresses of functional concentration in the Tokyo metropolitan area, land use had been homogenized in the surrounding areas.

The positive impact of floor area ratio on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is more significant in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Conversely, the negative impact of distance to nearest CBD on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is larger in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Moreover, wealthier dwellers may be willing to pay a higher price for a good lake view (especially views of small lakes), but infrastructure barriers (near some large lakes) cause negative effect [...] The outputs of this study, which provide detailed information on the relationships between <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and impact factors in local areas, are promising for urban planners to scientifically evaluate <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and make area-specific strategies.

40|$|Rental {{rates and}} <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> {{have gone through}} {{substantial}} changes the last two decades. The prices have both gone up and down since 1990 but from 1995 to 2008 <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> increased with 272 percent and rental rates with 61 percent. What factors that have the largest impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are hard to determine but factors that may affect the price are the desire {{to live in the}} countryside and the expected profitability in agriculture. Prices of products and inputs are factors that affect the profitability in agriculture, but the profitability is also affected by agricultural policies. The economic for Swedish agriculture have changed several times over the last 20 years as a result of changing agricultural policies. The agricultural policies largely affect farmers behavior and decisions. But how do the agricultural policies affect rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices?</b> Can we see any connections between past policies and the large increase in prices that has occurred during the last 20 years? In the year 2013 it is once again time for a new agricultural policy. The content of that policy is still unclear and it is therefore impossible to predict the new policyÂ´s impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> But by studying past agricultural policies impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> {{it might be possible to}} obtain an indication of future price developments. The thesis aim is to describe the development of rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Sweden the last two decades and to investigate if the development has been affected by agricultural policies. The empirical material is based on a literature review and regression analysis that test subsidies, wheat prices, total production value and interest rates impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Sweden between 1994 and 2008. Because of the limited time, the essay has been conducted as a qualitative study and the statistical material consists of secondary data. The conclusion is that rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> have gone through substantial changes during the past 20 years. The last time Sweden experienced a fall in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> was in the beginning of the 90 Â´s, but since Swedens entry in EU there has been a strong increase in both rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> The thesis also concludes that the change in rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> has been affected by the past agricultural policies during 1994 to 2008 and 1990 to 2008 respectively.

40|$|Codes JEL : R 1, D 8 We study two option {{values in}} the {{developable}} land market in a French department (Nord) : the classical option value relating to the short-run volatility of the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and a long-run option value resulting from uncertainty about demographic change. The findings show that both are significant. First, the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increases by 7. 4 - 15. 3 % when the standard deviation (STD) of the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> rises by a STD. Second, an increase of one STD in the STD {{of the variation in}} population between 1982 and 1999 entails a 6 % increase in the developable <b>land</b> <b>price...</b>|$|R

It is intended {{to serve as a}} basis for further research which will test the prevailing <b>land</b> <b>price</b> theory, as well as the validity of current practices used in land valuation. The problem is to attempt to determine those factors which are basic to the determination of <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> To accomplish this an analysis of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> with respect to farm income and soil productivity will be made and the findings compared with price theory. The prices used will be those prevailing in Lancaster County, Nebraska from 1919 through 1950. Advisor: C. Clyde Mitchel...|$|R
