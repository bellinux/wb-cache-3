5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they <b>live</b> <b>their</b> entire lives.

5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album at The Record Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, {{who was known}} for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded <b>live.</b> <b>Their</b> music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should be convinced that they cannot <b>live</b> <b>their</b> faith or share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people unable to <b>live</b> <b>their</b> lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E

5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact <b>live</b> <b>their</b> entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream.

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats <b>live</b> <b>their</b> lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to <b>live</b> <b>their</b> lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they <b>live</b> <b>their</b> lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
