5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern <b>littoral,</b> between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern <b>littoral</b> located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian <b>Littoral</b> and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E

5|$|Between 1939 and 1941, German forces invaded Poland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Soviet Union. Trieste, South Tyrol and Istria were ceded to Germany by Mussolini in 1943. Two puppet {{districts were}} {{set up in the}} area, the Operational Zone of the Adriatic <b>Littoral</b> and the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills.|$|E
40|$|An {{account is}} given {{of the human}} impact and {{eutrophic}} elements on biotic community in the salinity gradient drainage networks and marine <b>littorals,</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the Tarut Bay, on the Arabian Gulf. Marked differences occurred in the algal vegetation between the origin of a spring (S = 0. 3 %) and the final discharge in the marine <b>littorals</b> (S = 23 %). Influx of eutorphic elements and demolished building materials, which were dumped in the Tarut Bay, are causing perturbation to the tidal forests and marine <b>littorals.</b> Subsequently, a few mangroves inhabiting biotopes not described earlier were colonizing. A discussion is included to emphasis conservation and suggestions were made to monitor sites under threat of perturbation. In spite of the partial destruction of mangrove areas for the construction of corniche and urbanization, Anak and Al Awamiyah are still characterized by the best strands of mangrove swamps. ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} post-independence period, an {{important}} share of Argentina's exports came from cattle and sheep production. The livestock-raising economy {{was based upon}} the abundance of fertile land in the <b>littoral</b> provinces. Cropping apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, two {{companies}} headquartered in the Croatian <b>Littoral</b> {{ranked among the}} top fifty among Croatian companies by operating income. The highest ranked among them was the Rijeka-based Plodine supermarket chain, which ranked 16th, and Euro Petrol, a petroleum product wholesale and retail company, which ranked 22nd.|$|E
5|$|In the Balkan frontier, the Treaty of Devol {{marked the}} end of the Norman threat to the {{southern}} Adriatic <b>littoral</b> during Alexios' reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBridging {{terrestrial}} {{and marine}} ecosystems, Mediterranean coastal <b>littorals</b> are important floral and faunal habitats {{and an important}} component of the traditional Mediterranean landscape mosaic. The expanding urban footprint in Mediterranean <b>littorals</b> is increasingly threatening semi-natural sites and agriculture in coastal landscape. This paper proposes a holistic landscape approach to the sustainable planning of coastal <b>littorals</b> arguing that it is more likely to succeed because it is integrative of the concerns for safeguarding environmental resources and conservation of biodiversity but also responsive to socio-economic concerns of securing agricultural livelihood and providing for the cultural needs for open/green spaces by the growing inhabitants of coastal cities. The challenge is to combine protection for the three seemingly disparate activities. The town of Damour on the Mediterranean coast of Lebanon is taken as a case study. The wide coastal, banana cultivated plain makes for an exceptionally verdant landscape and scenic reprieve in an otherwise predominantly urbanized coastline. The methodology of ecological landscape design is applied to secure a holistic reading of the physical setting and propose a holistic, integrative conceptual model for the protection of coastal biodiversity that is ecologically sensitive and in synergy with agricultural and cultural uses...|$|R
50|$|NAVELSG is {{responsible}} for providing expeditionary logistic capabilities for the Navy, primarily within the maritime domain of the <b>littorals,</b> and conducts surface and air cargo handling missions, cargo terminal and warehouse operations, fuels distribution, postal services, customs inspections, ordnance reporting and handling, and expeditionary communications.|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Croatian <b>Littoral</b> is largely {{centered}} on the city of Rijeka, whose economic impact is felt directly {{not only in the}} geographic region, but also in other parts of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County—Gorski Kotar and Liburnia (modern region)—and a substantial part of Lika-Senj County. The most significant economic activities in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County are transport, largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka, shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian <b>Littoral,</b> and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland. In the city of Rijeka itself, the most significant economic activities are civil engineering, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage services, and the processing industry. Tourism, wood processing, and agriculture are the predominant economic activities in Lika-Senj County, where nearly all businesses are small and medium enterprisess.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's <b>littoral</b> in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian <b>Littoral</b> {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{supplementary}} material. Sea TENTACLE is {{a proposed}} afloat platform whose primary {{mission is to}} utilize the state-of-the-art technology of unmanned vehicles to monitor and neutralize all subsurface enemy threats in the <b>littorals.</b> This mission can be specified further as anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare and maritime surveillance. The design philosophy of Sea TENTACLE embodies the ideal of providing a multi-mission capable sea frame extending network-centric warfare into the <b>littorals.</b> The design goals of the TSSE team were first to develop a platform to deploy, recover, and maintain unmanned vehicle (e. g. UUVs, USVs, UAVs) and second to enableto ship {{to act as an}} afloat network operations center for distributed assets. Allowing all units to work together seamlessly to conduct focused missions in the <b>littorals</b> makes the Sea TENTACLE a creitical component within the network-centric environment. The versatility of its cargo hold and modular design allows Sea TENTACLE to be outfitted dynamically to complete a veriety of secondary missions including humanitarian aid, salvage and spacial operations support. Sea TENTACLE's combat management and operations system will employ the Enterprise architecture design enabling C 4 ISR capabilities that will meet emerging network centric warfare needs.

5|$|Some of the {{released}} Croats apparently {{succeeded in}} travelling to the Slovene <b>Littoral</b> {{in the closing}} days of the war.
