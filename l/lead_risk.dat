The <b>lead</b> <b>risk</b> model was developed {{using data from the}} National Occupational Exposure Survey, state lead registries, lead inspection results from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other sources. The model was applied to Massachusetts County Business Patterns and Department of Employment and Training databases to produce state and county estimates of numbers of employees potentially exposed to lead, and lead-using companies, ranked by exposure risk. The sensitivity of the state lead registry was evaluated using estimates from this model. To validate the model, a prevalence survey of lead exposure was conducted among a sample of 127 western Massachusetts plumbers. Based on the model, an estimated 1...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preventive {{approaches}} to childhood lead poisoning {{are critical for}} addressing this longstanding environmental health concern. Moreover, increasing evidence of cognitive effects of blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL highlights the need for improved exposure prevention interventions. OBJECTIVES: Geographic information system–based childhood <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> models, especially if executed at highly resolved spatial scales, can help identify children most at <b>risk</b> of <b>lead</b> exposure, as well as prioritize and direct housing and health-protective intervention programs. However, developing highly resolved spatial data requires labor- and time-intensive geocoding and analytical processes. In this study we evaluated the benefit of increased effort spent geocoding in terms of improved performance of <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> models. METHODS: We constructed three childhood <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> models based on established methods but using different levels of geocoded data from blood lead surveillance, county tax assessors, and the 2000 U. S. Census for 18 counties in North Carolina. We used the results to predict <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> levels mapped at the individual tax parcel unit. RESULTS: The models performed well enough to identify high-risk areas for targeted intervention, even with a relatively low level of effort on geocoding. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of widespread replication of highly spatially resolved childhood <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> models. The models guide resource-constrained local health and housing departments and community-based organizations {{on how best to}} expend their efforts in preventing and mitigating <b>lead</b> exposure <b>risk</b> in their communities...|$|R

A study of the ratios before and after treatments showed that GSH and zinc were better than heating in identifying false positives, and that zinc was preferable, owing to lesser dispersion of results around the mean. The ratios of ALA D activity before and after treatment is more closely correlated with PbB levels than ALA D activity without treatment. The addition of GSH restored the enzyme activity of the exposed subjects to values equal to those obtained with heating; this did not happen in the non-exposed subjects. It is postulated that, in lead exposure, the metal acts only on the thiol groups, which may then be reactivated by an optimal concentration of GSH...|$|E

Based on studies with industrial workers, the following risk factors have been rank-ordered according to the increasing risk of postural instability: task type, poor ambient lighting, elevated working surfaces (ladders or scaffolding), inclined working surfaces, and surface condition (slipperiness). Walkthrough surveys were conducted and laboratory data was collected to determine categories and ranking of slip/fall risk factors to be added to the modified ergonomic checklist...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} role of risk aversion and intertemporal {{substitutability}} in the investment-uncertainty relationship. Using recursive preferences, the paper demonstrates that not only the degree of risk aversion is important in determining {{the sign of the}} investmentuncertainty relationship but that the intertemporal substitution elasticity also plays a crucial role. This cannot be captured in the traditional expected utility set-up as risk aversion and intertemporal substitutability are determined by the same parameter. In particular, the paper shows that risk aversion can explain the negative relationship between investment and uncertainty only in a static context. In a dynamic framework, the linkage between periods can <b>lead</b> <b>risk</b> aversion to have a positive e¤ect on investment when uncertainty increases. Indeed, the e¤ects deriving from the linkage between periods depend by the intertemporal substitution elasticity: under low intertemporal substitutability, greater risk aversion can lead to higher investment when uncertainty increases. Moreover, the paper shows that with CRRA preferences investment should be positively correlated with the degree of uncertainty for reasonable values of the coe¢cient of relative risk aversio...|$|E
40|$|When the {{residents}} of Flint learned that lead had contaminated their water system, the local government made water-testing kits available to them free of charge. The city government published {{the results of these}} tests, creating a valuable dataset that is key to understanding the causes and extent of the lead contamination event in Flint. This is the nation's largest dataset on lead in a municipal water system. In this paper, we predict the lead contamination for each household's water supply, and we study several related aspects of Flint's water troubles, many of which generalize well beyond this one city. For example, we show that elevated <b>lead</b> <b>risks</b> can be (weakly) predicted from observable home attributes. Then we explore the factors associated with elevated <b>lead.</b> These <b>risk</b> assessments were developed in part via a crowd sourced prediction challenge at the University of Michigan. To inform Flint residents of these assessments, they have been incorporated into a web and mobile application funded by Google. org.

Additionally, a logistic regression analysis was performed with the matched data to evaluate the <b>LEAD</b> <b>risk.</b> Results.

40|$|Introduction: Much of {{the focus}} of <b>lead</b> <b>risk</b> health campaigns has been on {{vulnerable}} populations such as children and pregnant women, thus not communicating the risk of exposure for other adults. This becomes a particular issue for adults who are long-term residents of communities near lead mines {{as they can be}} at an increased risk of exposure to lead within their environment. As such, this study investigated the perceived risk of exposure to lead in residents of a lead mining community. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with 20 (3 male, 17 female) residents from a community in close proximity to a lead mine and were recruited through the community media and local organizations. Common themes were identified through an interpretative phenomenological analytical framework providing an in depth examination of the lived experiences of participants. Results: Majority of the participants did not perceive a health risk from exposure to lead. Those who reported a specific concern surrounding their exposure to lead had lived within the community for less than five years. However, it was commonly noted that the behaviors to control residents' exposure to lead were easily performed and low cost. Conclusions: These results suggest that residents of a community chronically exposed to lead seem to become complacent about their risk for poor health outcomes the longer they live within the community. These findings have implications for the communication of the risk of exposure to lead for adults who are chronically exposed to lead...|$|E
