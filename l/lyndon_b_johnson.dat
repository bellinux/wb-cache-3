50|$|Historically, Vermont was {{considered}} one of the most reliably Republican states in the country in terms of national elections. From 1856 to 1988, Vermont voted Democratic only once, in <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> landslide victory of 1964 against Barry M. Goldwater. It was also one of only two states—the other being Maine—where Franklin D. Roosevelt was completely shut out in all four of his presidential bids. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Republican presidential candidates frequently won the state with over 70 percent of the vote.|$|R

This quickly changed, however, when the warships received orders diverting {{them to the}} South China Sea where they joined other Navy units off the South Vietnamese coast and in the Gulf of Tonkin. As part of President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> effort to limit North Vietnamese attacks on Laos and South Vietnam, the carrier launched Vought F-8 Crusader aircraft to reconnoiter suspected communist infiltration routes in eastern and southern Laos.|$|R
5|$|The first African American {{appointed}} to the Court was Thurgood Marshall, appointed by <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson</b> in 1967. The second was Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H. W. Bush to succeed Marshall in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} {{election}}. The final election results gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes cast. His large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson</b> for President in the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the start}} of <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson?s</b> War on Poverty, the federal {{government}} has spent vast sums of money trying to lower U. S. poverty rates. Yet, despite the repeated allocation of massive financial resources, overall poverty rates have barely budged. There are two particularly pervasive possible explanations for that lack of success. First, official measures of poverty are geographically biased and financially incomplete. Second, federal policy relies heavily on those biased and incomplete measures to allocate aid. Despite the difficulties, adjusting the federal poverty thresholds used to determine eligibility for anti-poverty programs {{is the right thing to}} do. If the U. S. is going to win the War on Poverty, it needs a new map...|$|R
50|$|The {{seizure of}} the U.S. Navy ship and its 83 crew members, {{one of whom}} was killed in the attack, came {{less than a week after}} President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> State of the Union address to the United States Congress, just a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and only three days after 31 men of North Koreas KPA Unit 12 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of Pueblo and the abuse and torture of its crew during the {{subsequent}} 11-month prisoner drama became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between the western democracies and the Soviet Union and China.|$|R

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 made major changes in the relationship between Anglo-Americans and African Americans in the United States. This important statute declared illegal a segregated society, and put into the books of law the rights promised by the U. S. Constitution. This thesis analyzes President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> rhetorical efforts to ensure passage of this important piece of legislation. Through a combination of public and private persuasion, President Johnson helped put on the books a law which many pundits had believed unpassable...|$|R
5|$|NASA's {{center in}} Houston has {{its origins in}} the Space Task Group which {{directed}} its first manned spaceflight program, Project Mercury. In 1961, it grew into a bigger organization as the Manned Spacecraft Center, and in 1962 moved into a newly built campus on land donated by Rice University. It was renamed the <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson</b> Space Center (JSC) in honor of Texas U.S. Senator, Vice President, and President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson</b> in 1973, the year Johnson died. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson played a decisive role in passage of the legislation which created NASA in 1958. JSC contains the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States, and directed all Space Shuttle missions and activities aboard the International Space Station. The visitor's center of JSC is Space Center Houston.|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnson</b> National Historical Park, before entering <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B</b> <b>Johnson</b> State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route turns away from the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{alternate}} {{history has}} often shown how nuclear war could have arisen for certain crises. In the 1998 German-American mockumentary Der dritte Weltkrieg, Mikhail Gorbachev is ousted during his October 1989 visit to East Germany, after which the new hard-line government violently suppresses or preempts the Revolutions of 1989, and starts a seemingly contained conventional war which leads to an accidental nuclear exchange; the film then rewinds to show Gorbachev in East Berlin and ends with jubilant scenes from the [...] "different path" [...] of recorded history. In 2013s What If...Armageddon 1962, John F. Kennedy is assassinated before becoming President (killed by an actual would-be assassin who lost his nerve after realizing his attack would also kill Kennedys wife and children), and under <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> leadership, the Cuban Missile Crisis leads to an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.|$|R
500|$|Host Regis Philbin {{described}} Carpenter {{as having}} [...] "cruised right through those first fourteen questions," [...] he had proceeded {{to reach the}} final question without using any of his lifelines. The $1 million question was, [...] "Which of these U.S. Presidents appeared on the television series 'Laugh-In'?", with the choices being A) <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> <b>B)</b> Richard Nixon, C) Jimmy Carter, and D) Gerald Ford. Carpenter used his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call his father not for help, but rather to inform him that he knew the answer. Carpenter later explained, [...] "I thought I'd look so cocky if I didn't use any lifelines, so I faked it." ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{editor of}} Science News Letter, the {{publication}} of Science Service, an organization established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Science, and the National Research Council in 1920. His longstanding interest in attracting young people to science was noted by, among others, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson; President <b>Johnson</b> said in 1966 that Watson had [...] "awakened the minds and directed the energies of millions of young Americans toward the achievements in research and technology which are increasingly vital to human progress." [...] He founded, {{in his capacity as}} Director of Science Service, the Science Clubs of America, reaching at one point roughly a million school-age children across the United States; he also was one of the originators of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and the International Science Fair.|$|R
