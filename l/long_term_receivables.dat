40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 82 - 86) The {{valuation of}} assets used and held by the firm are of major importance {{in the preparation of}} the financial statements. For those investors and creditors that rely on the financial statement data for predicting, comparing and evaluating entity performance, the present statements based on generally accepted accounting principles, utilize a variety of historical concepts and methods that give different results for the different methods used when applied to the same transactions. This data is meaningless to the investor in terms of future service potential. This paper is written to analyze and discuss the different concepts {{from the standpoint of the}} needs of this investor. From this analysis it becomes obvious that no single valuation concept is applicable in all circumstances. Those concepts that provide the closest approximation to the future service potential value of the asset are recommended herein for use in preparation of the financial statements for this user. In order to provide some practicality to the recommended concepts, specific methods for providing the values discussed in the concepts are also discussed and recommended. The concepts recommended for each asset classification are: discounted future cash receipts or service potential concept for <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>receivables</b> and intangible assets; current output price (net realizable value) concept for temporary investments, inventories for which the sale is not critical, and land; current input cost (replacement cost) concept for inventories for which the sale is critical, supplies inventories, and depreciable plant assets; and the discounted future cost concept for leaseholds and long-term rental contracts. Using these concepts and their associated methods in the preparation of the financial statements, the investor user will have the type of information required for his decision-making process...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{association}} between self reported limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness and other dimensions of self reported health. DESIGN [...] Stratified random sample of general population. SETTING [...] Lothian region, Scotland, in 1993. SUBJECTS [...] 6212 men and women aged 16 and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness was assessed by the same question as used in the 1991 United Kingdom census. The short form 36 health survey {{was used to assess}} other dimensions of health. RESULTS [...] Rates of limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness were much higher than reported in the census. Scores on general and physical health scales had strong associations with limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness, but after adjustment for these associations psychosocial health measures had little influence on limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness. Being at the lower rather than the upper quartile on the physical functioning scale more than doubled the odds of having limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness. Reported prevalence of many common illnesses was between two and three times higher among those with limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness. CONCLUSIONS [...] A positive response to the question used by the census to define limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness was strongly associated with physical limitations on activity and less strongly influenced by scores on scales of mental and social wellbeing. Socioeconomic effects on limiting <b>long</b> <b>term</b> illness seem largely mediated through measures of general health and physical limitations on health...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{alternative}} explanatory factors of the so-called <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance puzzle, namely the fact that so few people purchase a <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance whereas this would seem to be a rational conduct given the high probability of dependence and the high costs of <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care. For that purpose, we survey various theoretical and empirical studies of the demand and supply of <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance. We discuss the vicious circle in which the <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance market is stuck: that market is thin because most people find the existing insurance products too expensive, and, at the same time, the products supplied by insurance companies are too expensive because of the thinness of the market. Moreover, we also show that, whereas some explanations of the puzzle involve a perfect rationality of agents on the LTC insurance market, others rely, on the contrary, on various behavioral imperfections. <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance, dependence, annuity puzzle...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Long</b> <b>Term</b> Care Benefit Plan is {{also known}} as an Assurance Benefit Plan. A Benefit Plan is {{separate}} from a <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care insurance policy because it allows policy holders to use any form of life insurance policies to pay for <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care. The plan converts a death benefit into a living benefit. Life insurance policies can be converted into a <b>Long</b> <b>Term</b> Care Benefit Plan for 30 to 60 percent of the policy amount to be used for <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care. The sale of a life insurance policy can keep people off Medicaid. By exchanging a life insurance policy for a <b>Long</b> <b>Term</b> Care Benefit Plan, the benefits go toward <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care including assisted living, home health care, and nursing homes. The conversion takes away the responsibility of premium payments from the family and there is no wait period before benefits begin. The policy transfer is subject to regulatory standards in each state. Benefits are deposited into a FDIC-insured benefit account that follows federal and state banking regulations and is held by a nationally chartered bank and trust company. The benefit payments are then made directly to the health care facility on a monthly basis.|$|R
