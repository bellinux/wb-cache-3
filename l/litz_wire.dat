40|$|In this thesis, three {{different}} models of wireless charging systems were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The first model that was evaluated was a basic {{model of a}} two winding wireless charging system with a capacitor connected in series {{with each of the}} coils. An auxiliary winding was added on top of the transmitter coil in order to provide the reactive power and two different topologies of three winding wireless transfer systems were compared to a basic model. The first three winding model had a capacitor connected in series in the receiver loop and in the auxiliary loop, while the last model of a wireless charging system had a capacitor in every loop. In order to predict the behaviour of each wireless charging system, a simulation in Matlab/Simulink was made, as well as the Bode plot for the transfer function of each system. After some practical measurements, {{it was found that the}} best overall efficiency was for a basic two winding model, which was 64 %. The three winding model with two capacitors had 57 % efficiency, while the model with three capacitors had 61 % efficiency. These values are rather low compared to the usual values of the efficiency for a wireless charging system for low power, and the main reason is that there were high copper losses, because <b>Litz</b> <b>wires</b> were not used in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|With {{different}} purposeful measurements {{like for}} the stray load losses and the flux densities, on two low-voltage squirrel-cage rotor asynchronous generators for 1. 5 MW wind turbines with different types of the stator winding (<b>litz</b> and round <b>wire),</b> {{the sources of the}} losses and the causes for the winding overheating are localized and defined. Different measures to reduce the stray load losses due the skin effect in the stator of the round wire winding generator are successfully tested and implemented in the manufacturing process. Thanks to these proven techniques the round wire winding is competitive to other expensive winding types. Analytical models for the estimation of the stator stray load losses due to the skin effect for profile, <b>litz</b> and round <b>wire</b> winding are compared to the measurements. A survey on the cheap and simple methods to measure the stray load losses in squirrel-cage induction motors, apart from the standardized methods, results in three equivalent “no-load” methods, where no coupling and no dynamometer or torque-meter are needed. The strengths and weaknesses of the measurement methods were investigated and compared with the standardized input-output test (residual loss method) and the reverse rotation test (RRT) on 27 standard TEFC grid-operated cage induction motors (2 -, 4 - and 6 -pole) with the current design of six European manufacturers with the rated power of 0. 37 kW, 0. 55 kW, 1. 1 kW, 5. 5 kW, 11 kW and 315 kW. It was concluded, that it is a benefit to add the eh-star method into the next edition of the future IEC 60034 - 2 *), as it is cheap, yielding comparable results with the input-output test, and is fitting better the purpose than RRT, which is already included in the standards. The theoretical background and the measurement procedure for the eh-star method are described in detail.

40|$|This {{work is a}} part of a {{research}} activity concerning electric vehicle charging conducted at the ABB research centre in Ladenburg, Germany. Battery chargers {{play a key role in}} the diffusion of electric vehicles (EV), which represent the best solution for dramatically reducing emissions in urban contexts and pollutants on a global scale. In fact, they are intended to provide controlled power for recharging the batteries, balancing at best different key aspects such as battery life preservation, recharge duration, low power losses, minimal distortion and high power factor at the mains size, while also ensuring electrical insulation from the grid for safety purposes. Cost effectiveness, small dimensions and light weight are also important features for such application, especially when on-board chargers are considered. A review of the most innovative EV charging techniques is conducted, highlighting the key role of resonant converters. In Chapter 2 the LLC resonant converter is analysed with different variations of the First Harmonic Analyses (FHA). Zero voltage switching (ZVS) and a robust voltage control are the main features of this topology. The most important operative conditions are studied, focusing on which ones allow to achieve ZVS. A design methodology for the resonant tank is proposed, taking into account the battery voltage range and the micro-controller frequency resolution. As application example, a 10 kW LLC converter operating at 100 kHz rated frequency is considered as case study, assuming a secondary voltage range 320 - 420 Vac and a primary bus voltage of 800 Vdc. For the case study a resonant tanks design is proposed and a PLECS® model is implemented. Analysis and simulations show that the correct operation of the converter is related to the passive elements. As a result, in order to achieve high efficiency, an oriented design of the transformer and of the resonant inductors is needed. The design of the transformer is addressed first, beginning with the explanation of some preliminary choices according to the converter specifications: such as the operative frequency and output power. Once the preliminary choices have been made, a step-by-step design procedure for the high-frequency transformer is proposed in Chapter 4. Differently from standard procedures, a set of libraries is supposed to be get ready, containing the most significant data related to soft magnetic materials, cores shape and size, copper and alloy conductor materials, and multi-strand <b>Litz</b> <b>wires.</b> In this way, the optimal design of the component consists in the most suited combination of library elements according to the design goals, with null customisation of the standard parts. After the parameter selection, analytic formulas, packed into a Matlab® function, are used to calculate total losses and efficiency. The analytic function also provides a raw estimation of the materials cost and the average temperature of the device, which the designer has to take into account as well. The most effective solution for each set of design specifications is found by varying the combination of library components and the windings arrangement. Finally, for the cited above case study four candidate designs are selected, featuring different combinations of magnetic materials, core shape and dimensions, and number of turns for the winding. In Chapter 5, the four transformers are analysed with a finite element software, ANSYS- Maxwell®. In this way is possible to validate the analytical results by means of 3 D FEM models. With such models, an accurate calculation of the inductances is also possible as well. When the values of the equivalent leakage and magnetising inductances is not included as design specifications, as initially assumed, external inductors could be included in the converter design to adjust at best the converter behaviour. A design for the series and parallel inductors is proposed to estimate overall size, weight, cost and losses of the magnetic components. In order to reduce costs and dimensions of the overall converter, the possibility of a magnetic integrated transformer is investigated. One can consider to adjust the transformer structure and design to meet also the inductance requirements, thus basically achieving the integration of the external components inside the transformer itself. To such purpose, several different possibilities are examined. Finally, a comparison between the “external inductors solution” and the “magnetic integrated solution” is performed...|$|R

At frequencies above about 1 MHz, the benefits become gradually offset by the capacitive build-up between the strands.

5000|$|Litz wire: To reduce {{skin effect}} losses, some coils are wound {{with a special}} type of radio {{frequency}} wire called <b>litz</b> <b>wire.</b> Instead of a single solid conductor, <b>litz</b> <b>wire</b> consists {{of a number of}} smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary stranded wire, the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its length {{on the outside of the}} wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.|$|E
50|$|However, {{for many}} {{high-frequency}} applications, proximity effect is {{more severe than}} skin effect, and in some limited cases, simple stranded wire can reduce proximity effect.
