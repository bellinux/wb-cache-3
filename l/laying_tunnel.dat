40|$|Purpose. In {{this article}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze the possibility of developing technology and increasing its efficiency during the Beskidskiy tunnel construction in difficult engineering and geological conditions. Methodology. The authors have performed analysis of the technological level of mining and construction works, new technique, equipment and production. One of the important issues of blasting operation is to ensure the seismic safety, acting at a distance of 30 m in the axes of single-track tunnel, as the distance to it will be 20 m from the nearest charge in the <b>laying</b> <b>tunnel.</b> This problem was solved by applying the combined blasting of blast-hole charges with delay-action and long-delay ways. Herewith the total mass of charges in the stope was divided into three groups, in which the first group is exploded by short-delay firing with, and the second one is exploded by short-delay firing too with intervals of 200 … 400 ms, the third is exploded by long-delay blasting at intervals of 500 … 10000 ms. The combined blasting of short-delay charges and delay action ones let significantly reduce seismic action at a mass explosion of charges when driving of double-track railway tunnel of a large cross-section. Findings. The paper presents the developed technology model, describing dependence of the machines from engineering and geological conditions. The methodology of drilling and blasting works at the construction of the tunnel callote and stross as well as a technique of arrangement determination and intervals of shot-delay and delay blasting of blasthole explosive charges was developed. Maximum permissible concentration of gases and vapours at blasting was presented. The calculations showed that the maximum level of gas contamination of the working area in Beskidskiy tunnel is achieved at blast operations. In accordance with this ventilation of the tunnel when driving is carried out by independent systems with mechanical ventilation by blowing using mine fans of special mining enterprises. Originality. The developed seismically safety charge masses are based on the well-known state about antiseismic blasting regulations. Practical value. The authors proposed and grounded the efficient technology for reduction to practice of drilling and blasting works (with dividing of the tunnel cross-section into the calotte and stross during of the Beskydy high-mountain tunnel construction. The results of technological experiment are presented...|$|E

Several of the intelligent serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl.

After {{receiving}} medication, Guzmán {{was last seen}} by security cameras at 20:52 hours near the shower area in his cell. The shower area was {{the only part of}} his cell that was not visible through the security camera. After the guards did not see him for twenty-five minutes on surveillance video, personnel went looking for him. When they reached his cell, Guzmán was gone. It was discovered he had escaped through a tunnel leading from the shower area to a house construction site 1.5 km away in a Santa Juanita neighborhood. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>lay</b> 10 m deep underground, and Guzmán used a ladder to climb to the bottom. The tunnel was 1.7 m tall and 75 cm in width. It was equipped with artificial light, air ducts, and high-quality construction materials. In addition, a motorcycle was found in the tunnel, which authorities think was used to transport materials and possibly Guzmán himself. Although guards discovered that Guzmán had escaped at 21:22 hours, a [...] "red alert", which locks down the prison and alerts a nearby military garrison, was only activated at midnight.|$|R

40|$|The {{stress and}} {{displacement}} distribution in a three-layer medium which contains a circular {{hole in the}} intermediate layer under the action of gravity forces is studied. The model was made of a plasticized epoxy polymer which presents enough deformation {{under the influence of}} its own weight. The projected image Moiré method was used for the measurements of the displacements. The deformation of the model was achieved by the inversion method, where the model was freely suspended from the one extremity and left to deform by its own weight. The stress components were determined by using the linear stress-strain relations, the latter quantities being calculated by differentiating the in-plane components of the displacement. Twp particular geometries of the perforated medium were studied: in the first the circular <b>tunnel</b> <b>lay</b> {{at the center of the}} intermediate layer, while in the second, the tunnel touched the two interfaces of the intermediate layer. Graphs showing the complete stress distribution in the more sensitive intermediate layer around the tunnel are given. The stress concentration factors at the boundary of the cavity were established. Important results for the stress distribution and the influence of the geometry of the tunnel on the stress concentration factors were deduced. All these results are very useful for the design of tunnels in soil and rock. © 1977...|$|R
5000|$|Construction on {{the lower}} level of the 63rd Street tunnel was {{completed}} along with the upper subway level. However, due to New York City's financial crises of the 1970s, the LIRR project was canceled long before the tunnel was completed. In 1976, the New York Times noted that the lower level of the 63rd Street tunnel was still under construction, even though [...] "officials knew that the tunnel would never be used." [...] Richard Ravitch, the MTA chairman, said that to stop the work was impossible or so costly as to make it impractical subsequent {{to the construction of}} the subway portion." [...] The 63rd Street subway line and LIRR tunnel were completed as far as 21st Street in Long Island City, Queens, with the subway level of the tunnel opening in 1989. The LIRR tunnel remained unused beneath the subway tracks. Between 1995 and 2001, the 63rd Street subway tunnel was extended east to connect to the Queens Boulevard subway line; the LIRR tunnel was also extended east, under 41st Avenue in Queens to the west side of Northern Boulevard in Queens. The western end of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>lay</b> dormant under Second Avenue at 63rd Street for three decades. By the time that construction on the LIRR tunnel level stopped, the tunnel was built for a distance of 8600 ft.

60|$|Alas for all {{the wise}} words of the good Chandos! Alas {{for all the}} lessons in order and {{discipline}} learned from the wary Knolles. In an instant, forgetful of all things but this noble challenge, Nigel was running {{at the top of}} his speed for the burning gate. Close at his heels was the Frenchman, blowing and gasping, as he rushed along in his brazen armor. Behind came a stream of howling archers and men-at-arms, like a flood which has broken its dam. Down they slipped into the ditch, rushed across it, and clambered on each other's backs up the opposite side. Nigel, Raoul and two archers gained a foothold in front of the burning gate at the same moment. With blows and kicks they burst it to pieces, and dashed with a yell of triumph through the dark archway beyond. For a moment they thought with mad rapture that the castle was carried. A dark <b>tunnel</b> <b>lay</b> before them, down which they rushed. But alas! at the farther end it was blocked by a second gateway as strong as that which had been burned. In vain they beat upon it with their swords and axes. On each side the tunnel was pierced with slits, and the crossbow bolts discharged at only a few yards' distance crashed through armor as if it were cloth and laid man after man upon the stones. They raged and leaped before the great iron-clamped barrier, but the wall itself was as easy to tear down.|$|R
