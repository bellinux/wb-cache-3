5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open the line to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents. Oslo Sporveier, the operator, turned down the proposals, arguing that it would cost about 3billion NOK to lay the tracks and put up overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{and that it would}} not attract enough passengers.|$|E
5|$|The train's {{derailment}} caused {{severe damage}} to the Overhead <b>Line</b> <b>Equipment</b> and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting {{in a number of}} other electric-powered services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's fail safe design.|$|E

These improvements included refurbishing the production <b>line</b> <b>equipment,</b> including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E

25|$|Infrastructure {{problems}} have affected performance. According to Network Rail, the main {{problems have}} been track-circuit failures, broken rails, track faults, points failures and overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> (OLE) failures. Network Rail, {{which is responsible for}} the infrastructure, intended to improve performance by work carried out during a planned closure of London Liverpool Street station over Christmas and New Year 2007/8. This allowed much of the outer London overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> to be replaced by modern, self-tensioning lines. The work was carried out, but overran at short notice by some 24 hours, causing ridicule in the national press.|$|E
25|$|This {{involved}} signalling {{works and}} alterations to {{the tracks and}} overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> between Farringdon and City Thameslink to allow the merged services to operate. Trains from the south that previously terminated at Blackfriars now terminated at Kentish Town or further north, and 23 dual-voltage Class 377/5 Electrostars were procured to meet the additional rolling stock requirements.|$|E
25|$|After {{the public}} event, Debdale Park station was {{dismantled}} and the timber platform {{was used to}} build the new Hag Fold railway station near Wigan; and the electric overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> was taken down and re-used at the Heaton Park Tramway on the lakeside extension. The demonstration train DLR Number 11 was transported to London where it was put into operation on the Docklands Light Railway.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{the route}} {{came under the}} control of the newly created Network SouthEast, which {{introduced}} a bold new blue, red and white livery. The extension of the overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> soon allowed the units to work services on the West Anglia route from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge. In 1992, electrification spread north from Cambridge to Ely and King's Lynn, allowing the replacement of locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} United States forces in Europe and the Pacific began to reach full {{strength}} in 1943–1944, Lend-Lease continued. Most remaining allies were largely self-sufficient in front <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> (such as tanks and fighter aircraft) by this stage, but Lend-Lease provided a useful supplement {{in this category}} even so, and Lend-Lease logistical supplies (including motor vehicles and railroad equipment) were of enormous assistance.|$|E
25|$|Since 1999, {{the line}} has been modernised and the {{overhead}} <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> has been refurbished and renewed from Mark 1 / Mark 3A to UK1 range to allow an increase line speeds from 110mph to 125mph (with 140mph capability in areas previously fitted with Automatically Tensioned Mark 1 equipment - subject to upgrading of the balance weight arrangement to provide individually tensioned contact / catenary wires and regrading of the contact wires).|$|E
5000|$|National {{telephone}} systems define other tones {{that indicate}} {{the status of}} <b>lines,</b> <b>equipment,</b> or the result of calls.

25|$|On 7 July 2015, trailer 58 {{suffered}} a serious derailment {{on a relatively}} new crossover just north of Laxey Station, toppling onto its side. Services were suspended between Laxey and Ramsey. A complex operation was undertaken to lift the trailer back upright. It required a road closure, removal of overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> and a large crane. The re-railed trailer was then moved by tractor to Laxey Station and has since returned to service after overhaul.|$|E
25|$|The OLE (overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment)</b> {{system has}} been {{extended}} from Farringdon to City Thameslink and was commissioned in December 2009, Combined with a new crossover in Snow Hill tunnel between the two stations, this allows southbound trains to be turned back should they fail to change from London Midland Region AC traction current to Southern Region third rail. The crossover currently located within City Thameslink station {{for the purpose of}} allowing trains from Smithfield sidings to enter platform 2 was removed as Blackfriars station was rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> {{depends on}} the location. If the tracks are close together, central poles with 'steady' arms on each side are used. If the tracks are further apart, poles on either side with span wire are used. With aesthetics in mind a minimum number of traction poles are used and whenever possible the wire is anchored onto neighbouring buildings. Supertram, Sheffield City Council and landlords were in talks to try and hide anchor points {{as much as possible}} and blend them into the structures.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the closure}} of most of France's tram systems in {{previous}} decades, a rapidly growing number of France's major cities boast new tram networks, including Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Grenoble, Montpellier, St Etienne and Strasbourg (Strasbourg has the largest French network). Since the 1990s, tram systems have been introduced, or expanded, in twenty-seven towns and cities Trams in France#Current tramway systems, with many experiments such as ground level power supply in Bordeaux (to avoid the need for overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment)</b> or trolleybus-tram-BRT hybrids in Nancy and Caen with Bombardier's Guided Light Transit. Smaller cities like Aubagne or Avignon are now planning tram lines.|$|E
25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London. An overhead conductor rail replaced the traditional Mk3b solid wire between the former King's Cross Thameslink station to St Pancras International station.|$|E
25|$|Repair {{works were}} {{estimated}} at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the reinforcing steel mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead <b>line</b> <b>equipment</b> on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E
