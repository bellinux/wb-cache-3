40|$|The use of {{finite element}} based limit <b>load</b> <b>analysis</b> for the {{assessment}} of the primary load capacity of a pressure vessel is well established and numerous papers on the subject, including experimental results, have been published in the last decade. Finite element based limit <b>load</b> <b>analysis</b> is often used in the context of NB- 3228. 1 Limit Analysis to demonstrate a margin against ductile burst as an alternative to satisfaction of the NB- 3200 limits on general, local and primary membrane plus bending stress intensity. However, although NB- 3200 permits the use of ‘limit analysis’, no specific guidance on the use of finite element methods for this purpose is provided.

Ordinary <b>load</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques stress on statistical processing of hourly load data along predefined time axes, producing numerical results of a standard granularity, such as daily or weekly mean loads.

The tables holding energy consumption values, where columns represent the days of the selected period and lines represent the 24 hours of the day, are then illustrated through the use of colour patterns. In such a way, chronological typical units of variable structure and granularity can be identified and provide the basis for an extensive cross-examination, resulting in optimized decision making and energy policy definition. In order to demonstrate the advantages of the approach, a dedicated DSS implementation and application in the Greek public power corporation was also performed. © 1995...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} modelling {{approach for}} gust and manoeuvre <b>loads</b> <b>analysis</b> is presented. Typically, the unsteady aerodynamics for gust loads are computed by the Doublet Lattice Method. However, this method {{does not account}} for effects, which are important from a flight dynamics and manoeuvre loads perspective. E. g., the roll-yaw coupling, also responsible for the flight mechanical eigenmodes like the dutch roll mode, are unaccounted for by the DLM. Since, the dutch roll mode might also be excited by lateral gusts, this might have an influence on the loads response. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics are computed by a 3 D panel method, capable of capturing the flight dynamics accurately and provide complex Aerodynamics Influence Coefficients for gust <b>loads</b> <b>analysis</b> as a function of reduced frequency similar to the DLM. The aerodynamics of the panel method are validate by comparison with CFD results.

40|$|This essay, {{based on}} my 2012 MSOM Fellow Lecture, {{discusses}} an idea that has been useful for developing effective methods to set staffing levels in service systems: offered <b>load</b> <b>analysis.</b> The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered <b>load</b> <b>analysis</b> looks {{at the amount of}} capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable.

In order to obtain accurate predictions, the system damping properties must be properly {{taken into account in}} the finite element model used for coupled <b>loads</b> <b>analysis.</b> This is typically done using a structural damping characterization in the frequency domain, which is not applicable in the time domain. Therefore, the structural damping matrix of the system must be converted into an equivalent viscous damping matrix when a transient coupled <b>loads</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed. This paper focuses on the validation of equivalent viscous damping methods for dynamically condensed finite element models via correlation with experimental data for a realistic structure representative of a slender launch vehicle with solid rocket motors. A second scope of the paper is to investigate how to conveniently choose a single combination of Young's modulus and structural damping coefficient - complex Young's modulus - to approximate the viscoelastic behavior of a solid propellant material in the frequency band of interest for coupled <b>loads</b> <b>analysis.</b> A scaled-down test article inspired to the Z 9 -ignition Vega launcher configuration is designed, manufactured, and experimentally tested to obtain data for validation of the equivalent viscous damping methods.
