40|$|Efficient and well-maintained road {{systems are}} {{necessary}} for the economic well being of any industrialized country. Maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads have taken priority over new construction in recent years, thus making information {{about the condition of}} road surfaces extremely important. Several methods of gathering this information have been developed worldwide; one of them is Laser Road Surface Tester (<b>Laser</b> <b>RST),</b> which was developed in Sweden in 1981. The <b>Laser</b> <b>RST</b> is a laser-based, computer-automated, non-contact road profilometer system with the ability to collect and simultaneously process data about the road surface. Variables measured include rut depth, unevenness, cracking, megatexture, rough macrotexture, fine macrotexture, crossfall, curves, and elapsed distance. Subjective evaluations are also supported, if desired. Eleven laser rangefinders (LRFs), mounted {{on the front of the}} <b>Laser</b> <b>RST</b> van, are the primary components of the data collection system. They scan the road with high-speed, high-resolution distance sampling. The signals from the lasers are sent through signal processing cards (SPCs) and then to a computer inside the van for final processing. Data is stored on floppy disk and printed by an on-board printer. The <b>Laser</b> <b>RST</b> is an extremely complex system but it is also a modular one, making troubleshooting and repair relatively easy, inexpensive, and fast. This paper discusses the various modules available. Variables measured are defined and measurement algorithms detailed. The <b>Laser</b> <b>RST</b> system can be customized to meet specific user requirements quickly and easily...|$|R

The aim os the analysis is to predict ow characteristics more accurately than steady state simulations, and to provide input to noise analysis. To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} simulations, the computed ow elds are compared with test data obtained from <b>laser</b> measurements. This <b>rst</b> report in the series focuses on various approaches to simulate the blower and scroll system in terms of uid dynamics and uid structure interactions.

The idea is based on a technique of " the energy spread along the electron bunch. Since the radiation ampli cation process is extremely sensitive to the value of the energy spread, only that part of the electron bunch radiates whichhaslowenergy spread. A novel technique is proposed for preparation of electron beam with required shaping of the energy spread allowing to overcome the problem of electron pulse jitter (about 1 ps). The system consists of two undulators separated by electron bypass and optical pulse shaping system. Undulators are tuned for ampli cation of the radiation with 523 nm wavelength. A seed radiation pulse (10 ps pulse duration, 0. 3 J pulse energy, 30 kWpeakpower) is generated by present TTF <b>laser</b> facility. The <b>rst</b> undulator operates in the linear regime and produces 300 fs radiation pulse naturally synchronized with the electron bunch.

40|$|The Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source RILIS [1] at the CERN-ISOLDE on-line {{radioactive}} {{ion beam}} facility {{is essential for}} ion beam production {{for the majority of}} experiments, but it is also powerful tool for laser spectroscopy of rare isotopes. A series of experiments on in-source laser spectroscopy of polonium isotopes [2, 3] revealed the nuclear ground state properties of 191; 211; 216; 218 Po. However, limitations caused by the isobaric background of surface-ionized francium isotopes hindered the study of several neutron rich polonium isotopes. The development of the Laser Ion Source and Trap (LIST) [4] and finally its integration at ISOLDE has led to a dramatic suppression of surface ions. Meanwhile, the RILIS laser spectroscopy capabilities have advanced tremendously. Widely tunable titanium:sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers were installed to complement the established dye laser system. Along with a new data acquisition system [5], this more versatile <b>laser</b> setup enabled <b>rst</b> ever <b>laser</b> spectroscopy of the radioactive element astatine [6]. Narrow bandwidth operation of the Ti:Sa lasers [7] facilitated the high resolution spectroscopy of infrared transitions. These advancements of the RILIS laser setup combined with the LIST technique {{paved the way for the}} continuation of the polonium campaign at CERN towards neutron-rich isotopes, including 217; 219 Po, through a suppression of surface ionized francium of up to four orders-of-magnitude. In this contribution, we present the recent results of the in-source laser spectroscopy of polonium [8]. The results of the analysis of the isotope shift and hyperne spectra of 217 Po, obtained by the first in-LIST laser spectroscopy combined with precise scanning of the narrow bandwidth Ti:Sa laser, show how 217 Po delineates the region of odd-even staggering reversal for the charge radii. To demonstrate the diverse applications of in-source laser spectroscopy at RIB facilities, we will conclude by presenting the high precision determination of the ionization energy of the polonium atom obtained from the ovserved Rydberg spectrum [8].

40|$|Background: Laser {{treatment}} for diabetic retinopathy is {{often associated with}} visual fi eld reduction and other ocular side-eff ects. Our aim was to assess whether long-term lipid-lowering therapy with fenofi brate could reduce the progression of retinopathy and the need for laser treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: The Fenofi brate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study was a multinational randomised trial of 9795 patients aged 50 - 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive fenofi brate 200 mg/day (n= 4895) or matching placebo (n= 4900). At each clinic visit, information concerning laser {{treatment for}} diabetic retinopathy-a prespecifi ed tertiary endpoint of the main study-was gathered. Adjudication by ophthalmologists masked to treatment allocation defi ned instances of laser treatment for macular oedema, proliferative retinopathy, or other eye conditions. In a substudy of 1012 patients, standardised retinal photography was done and photographs graded with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) criteria to determine the cumulative incidence of diabetic retinopathy and its component lesions. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 64783481. Findings: Laser treatment was needed more frequently in participants with poorer glycaemic or blood pressure control than in those with good control of these factors, and in those with a greater burden of clinical microvascular disease, but the need for such treatment was not aff ected by plasma lipid concentrations. The requirement for fi <b>rst</b> <b>laser</b> treatment for all retinopathy was signifi cantly lower in the fenofi brate group than in the placebo group (164 [3 紥] patients on fenofi brate vs 238 [4 繥] on placebo; hazard ratio [HR] 0 綹, 95 % CI 0 絶- 0 縴; p= 0 簰 02; absolute risk reduction 1 絥 [0 緭 2 糝). In the ophthalmology substudy, the primary endpoint of 2 -step progression of retinopathy grade did not diff er signifi cantly between the two groups overall (46 [9 綥] patients on fenofi brate vs 57 [12 糥] on placebo; p= 0 籹) or in the subset of patients without pre-existing retinopathy (43 [11 紥] vs 43 [11 緥]; p= 0 縷). By contrast, in patients with pre-existing retinopathy, signifi cantly fewer patients on fenofi brate had a 2 -step progression than did those on placebo (three [3 籥] patients vs 14 [14 綥]; p= 0 簰 4). An exploratory composite endpoint of 2 -step progression of retinopathy grade, macular oedema, or laser treatments was signifi cantly lower in the fenofi brate group than in the placebo group (HR 0 綶, 95 % CI 0 紷- 0 繴; p= 0 簲 2). Interpretation: Treatment with fenofi brate in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus reduces the need for laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, although the mechanism of this eff ect {{does not seem to be}} related to plasma concentrations of lipids.

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Materials Science and Nanotechnology and the Graduate School of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2015. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2015. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 122 - 135. Since {{the invention}} of the laser in the 60 s, the main advances in laser technology were done in two directions; shorter pulses and higher powers. In order to achieve this purpose, many laser types are developed and always replaced with simpler, smaller, cheaper alternatives that can deliver the same or better parameters. In the past 20 years, ber lasers have become an important alternative that can match and even enhance the performance of currently used lasers while reducing the complexity, costs and instability. Optical bers, which are the main components of ber <b>lasers,</b> were <b>rst</b> de- veloped just as a substitute for conventional cables since they offer much less attenuation in carrying signals over long ranges. So, most of the studies were focused on making the bers better for communication channels. After realizing that ber lasers offer better beam qualities, which is also a vital parameter for many laser applications, researches started nding ways to use bers for lasers and they achieved this in 80 s by the rst ever utilization of low-attenuation ac- tive bers. After {{the invention of}} double-clad bers, utilization of diode lasers for pumping and development of efficient rare-earth doped bers, ber lasers became more than just a research topic in the laboratory and began to nd use in many applications. The utilization of ber lasers for short (nanoseconds) and ultrashort (picosec- onds, femtoseconds) pulse generation was a difficult task for researchers. The biggest challenge to overcome was nonlinear effects caused by the con nement of the beam into small volumes. By using smart designs like chirped pulse ampli - cation and highly doped lasers, pulse energies and peak powers close to solid-state ultrafast lasers can be achieved. These nonlinear effects were not just problems in the power scalability of ber lasers, on the other hand, they were an opportunity for new possible applications. For example, using these nonlinear effects inside bers, supercontinuum generation was demonstrated and found usage in many areas like spectroscopy, imaging and metrology. Today, more than 50 worldwide companies sell short-pulse ber lasers for ap- plications as diverse as ophthalmology, micromachining, medical imaging and precision metrology. Especially, ber-laser-based micromachining is routinely im- plemented in the fabrication processes for widely used consumer products. New applications of ber lasers are being continuously developed. Consequently, in this Ph. D. thesis study, new application areas of ber lasers are investigated. Ultrashort and short pulsed ber lasers are developed and uti- lized for biological and transparent material processing, spectroscopy and imag- ing. In the rst part of thesis study, we have demonstrated the use of a custom- built ber laser-based microscope system for nanosurgery and tissue ablation experiments. Through the use of custom FPGA electronics acting through ber- coupled AOMs, we are able to generate custom pulse sequence. Using this system, we have made photodisruption experiments in tissue level, cellular level and sub- cellular level. In the second part of this thesis study, in collaboration with Bogazici Univer- sity, we have developed a nanosecond ber laser system that is able to generate wavelength components of 600 nm to 1300 nm, developed speci cally for pho- toacoustic excitation. Using this system, we have made photoacoustic signal excitation in a ceramic sample and prepared the system for further experiments to generate photoacoustic images from biological specimens. In the third part of thesis study, in collaboration with ODTU, the development of a THz-TDS system driven by a novel Yb-doped ber laser whose repetition rate can be tuned, speci cally for fast scan THz measurements, is realized. Char- acterization of the built laser system is done considering the necessities for the OSCAT technique as an alternative method for fast scan THz measurements. Stability of the oscillator is examined in terms of power, spectrum and pulse duration with the changing repetition rate of the laser. Using this system THz waveforms are generated at different wavelengths and the system is prepared for further research in spectroscopy. In {{the last part of the}} thesis study, a high-pulse energy femtosecond laser system is developed and utilized for transparent material processing. The laser output is coupled to a fast galvo-scanner system, and a synchronized translation stage such that very wide areas (10 cm x 10 cm) are able to be processed with very high speed (2 m/s). Using this system, glass samples are cut, engraved and photodarkened. Yavaş, SeydiPh. D...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{address a}} {{question}} in social epistemology about the unity of a scientic community to- wards its inner groups (teams, labs [...] .). I investigate the reasons why these groups might want to it alone", working among themselves and hiding their discoveries from other groups. I concentrate on the intermediate results of a longer project, where the first steps can help to achieve a more advanced result. I study {{to what extent the}} isolation of research groups might be damaging to the epistemic progress of the whole community. In order {{to get an idea of}} the reason why scientists might not share their intermediate results with others, consider for example Schawlow and Townes in the summer of 1958 (the historical material is drawn from Broberg, 1991, chap. 3) : together they had just designed the principle of functioning of what would be known as the laser, with the intention of constructing the <b>rst</b> <b>laser,</b> relying on their theoretical ideas. Should they have published their theoretical discovery, or rather taken advantage of their advance on possible oppo- nents and start the experimental work? They chose to publish their theoretical ideas in a scientic journal, and they also led a patent application. On the one hand, it was a valuable choice: the patent was granted and their paper was published, making them soon famous. Further- more, another scientist called Gould was to le a simi- lar patent application a few months later, in March 1959; it was refused, because of the priority of Schawlow and Townes. If the latter had not submitted their idea in 1958, the patent would certainly have been acknowl- edged to Gould. In this sense, publishing their intermediate result was a worthy strategy. On the other hand, history showed that their publication had also some drawbacks for them. Schawlow and Townes' publication triggered a race among many American laboratories for the rst experimental construction of the laser. In addition to bringing them competitors, their publication helped these competitors in crucial ways; so much so that it was another scientist, Maiman, and not Schawlow and Townes, who was able to build the <b>rst</b> working <b>laser,</b> in May 1960, and to publish the result. If Schawlow and Townes had not published their theoretical idea, there are chances that they would have been the first ones to build a laser. Their publication of the first theoretical result certainly prevented them from getting the second experimental one. In short, the best publishing strategy about an intermediate result is no easy question for a scientist. Consider now the whole community, concerned with the results available to all and with the pace of the epistemic progress. Schawlow and Townes' publication enabled the <b>rst</b> <b>laser</b> to be built quicker, as other teams could rely on their theoretical work. More generally, being able to reuse other's works seems to be a rm basis of scientic progress. Thus, for the whole community, it seems that there are only benets if intermediate results are published. As this is not necessarily the best strategy for those who reach these intermediate results, there might be a conflict between the interests of individuals and those of the whole community. The question Schawlow and Townes faced was whether they should make their discovery publicly known, or keep it for themselves to progress alone. This alternative can also arise for an entire lab, when competing with other labs on some long-run project: should it make its discoveries known to its opponents, or only share them internally among its members? At a higher level still, this question arises for what can be called scientic schools, which are groups of labs sharing some particular approach|methodological, experimental or interpre- tational, for example. At each level within the scientic community, there are competitive groups of scientists which may decide to go it alone and to prevent their results from being accessible to others. If they had good reasons for doing so, there would be dramatic consequences for the whole community: other groups would not be able to reuse their results, labour force would be wasted in achieving them again, and the progress of the eld would be slowered. 9 The aim of this paper is to investigate this risk of division: to assess the conditions under which it may oc- cur, its damage for the community, and to draw the limit of an acceptable pluralism. The reasoning with benets and drawbacks which has been sketched for Schawlow and Townes seems to be implicitly an informal economic argument. In order to clarify and to rene such an argument, I will investigate it in a rational decision framework, supposing some utility or preferences for the groups of scientists, and I will propose a formal model, in game theory. In social epistemology of science, formal models have been proposed for various questions (for example, Kitcher 1990, 1993, Goldman 2009, Strevens 2003, 2006, Weisberg and Muldoon, forthcoming, Zollman 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), but not for the question of the division of the scientic community. I will concentrate on the normative aspect of the question, ignoring the descriptive and historical question of whether groups do go it alone or not. The model I propose is sequential: two groups are competing on a research program, which consists of several results which have to be obtained in order. The groups always carry out some research for the next result, which they reach with some probability per unit of time. When a group, say A, reaches a result, it can either make it public for the other group, or continue its research. After a result is made public, the competitor B can start from it so as to continue its own research. Thus, when A publishes it loses its lead, and its competitor will be able to compete with it in the near future. But it is also recognized as the rst to reach this step. I consider two dierent cases, one in which the number of steps is limited, another where the limit concerns the number of temporal intervals. In both cases, assuming that all steps are equally dicult and equally rewarding, it turns out that the best strategy for a group concerned with its own reward is to make public every step it takes. Thus, there is no risk that groups might separate: a scientist, whatever its group, will publish for all. Finally, I turn to more complex situations, where results have varying size or diculty: there, groups can indeed be better o going it alone...|$|R
