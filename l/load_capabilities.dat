It demonstrated <b>load</b> <b>capabilities</b> through successful stowage of gear and supplies that Marines would require for three days of operations, with space available for additional equipment. The human factors evaluation demonstrated the spacious interior by accommodating the specified number of combat-equipped Marines and enabling rapid tactical and emergency egress through a quick-release hatch. The Terrex repeated ocean swim and maneuverability results were achieved in a March 2013 rehearsal event.

40|$|The {{consistent}} {{further development}} of all-ceramic restorations particularly in combination with maxillary incisors positions the utilisation of prefabricated glass fiber reinforced endodontic posts (gfrc-posts) into the focus of interest. The influence of the separate components on the maximum <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> of the entire construct of tooth, endodontic post, composite build-up and the dental crown {{has not yet been}} evaluated. In the present study the maximum <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> Fmax [N] of endodontic treated maxillary anterior incisors being restored with prefabricated glass fiber reinforced posts, composite cores and all-ceramic crowns, was examined. In this context the influence of the separate stages of restoration, material and also the chewing simulation was evaluated. The results of the current study lead to the following stated conclusions: Maximum <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> of adhesively reconstructed endodontic treated maxillary central incisors was independent of the post material. On the other hand there is a statistical significant difference based on the materials of the composite cores and the luting cements. In the current examination a protection of root dentin by luting posts with composites in contrast to conventional cements could be verified. Regarding to the stage of restoration maximum <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> increased almost linear by incremental degree of restoration whereby significant differences could be detected among all groups examined in this context. Thereby maximum <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> was achieved with the final stadium of restoration in a ferrule preparation design. Fatigue loading in form of chewing simulation of this final stage led to significant lower load values.

At the same time BIAMAX introduced railway wagons, and kept producing an extended range of bus and truck bodies, assembling 4x4's and tractors etc., with thousands of vehicles coming out of its factories, many of which were exported to a large number of countries, mainly in Europe, Asia and Africa; at times the company exported as much as 50% of its production.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of component dynamics {{is one of}} the main tasks of internal combustion engine (ICE) simulation. This prediction is important in order to understand complex loading conditions, which happen in a running ICE.

A generic friction modeling approach for radial slider bearings, which can be applied to lubricated contact regimes, will be presented in this paper. Besides viscous friction, the approach considers in particular boundary friction. The parameterization of the friction model is done using surface material and surface roughness measurement data. Furthermore, fluid properties depending on the applied oil additives are being considered.
