40|$|The {{image of}} the broken-down tractor {{is one of the}} {{stereotypes}} of over-hasty development strategies. Sceptical reports about the failure of agricultural projects to meet ambitious targets are often accompanied by photos of rusting, inappropriate farm equipment dating from the 1960 s and 1970 s. In the same way, pictures of inappropriate and unused windmills, or second-hand computers, are scattered across the pages of sceptical reports of development mistakes in the 1980 s and 1990 s. And yet a good craftsperson does not blame his or her tools, and if agricultural mechanisation has not lived up to its promises, the reasons lie not in the technologies, but in the decisions about how they are used ? and by whom. We take a look at strategies for real empowerment, for using human and animal muscle power and mechanical energy in ways that are better than ever for raising food production. Farmers mechanise to produce more for the same amount of labour, and to reduce drudgery, {{according to a recent study}} report undertaken for CTA and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Not that mechanisation should be confused with motorisation and tractorisation ? these are just two options, representing a small share of agricultural work in most ACP States. Indeed, some of the most successful attempts at mechanisation have used animal power ? estimated to perform up to 20 % of farming operations. Most agricultural work (perhaps 80 %) still depends entirely on human labour. The process of agricultural mechanisation, the report says, has to take three important contexts into account: the economic, environmental and social. Obviously, no farmer is going to invest in mechanisation without the outlook of increased income and profit: the lack of certainty here has often led to the demise of supporting services, such as tractor hire, suppliers and local maintenance and repair enterprises. Mechanisation is not a guarantee for improved productivity. In many cases, such as in the Segou and Atacora regions of Mali, where animal traction has become part of the landscape in the last three decades, it has led to increased production but only by making it possible for mechanised farmers to increase the land they can cultivate. This in turn depends on their ability to acquire or have access to more land, a topic discussed in the previous article. In the Mali projects, some farmers obtained 50 % more land, and increased production accordingly ? although there are many reports of yield per hectare actually falling after mechanisation. Such short-term gains in income and food security, which are not full blessings for all farmers, put longer-term development at risk, by damaging the local environmental system. In such circumstances, agricultural mechanisation brings fallow land back into use more quickly and, at the same time, reduces the area of <b>land</b> <b>lying</b> <b>fallow.</b> It hinders the natural regeneration of trees and bushes, impoverishes the stock of organic matter in the soil, and it can lead to erosion. It can also assist conservation, the report emphasises, by making the work of building bunds and terraces easier to undertake. Despite these advantages, there is a widespread belief that it could lead to a vicious circle of extensification into more and more vulnerable ecosystems, and to land degradation. The social side is that, like most efforts to affect development through a technology thrust, it leads to a widening gap of opportunity and wealth in rural areas. In the wrong hands, without sensitive management, the technology which was expected to raise living standards and reduce drudgery can in fact impoverish members of the community and force them to join the drift to the city. Those owning or controlling the technology receive the greatest benefit: equitable development does not seem possible. Need for new strategies The recent wave of liberalisation in most ACP States has seen the decline of government efforts to encourage mechanisation directly. Instead, the market force of demand is a reason for new companies to invest in more appropriate products and services, and more credit facilities are becoming available. Mechanisation is now getting ready for real business, but a well-balanced approach will be required for it to be a proper player in strategies for sustainable agriculture, rather than continuing its rather disruptive history. A seminar organised by CTA in November 1997 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on this topic led to a broad set of guidelines for the 'where/how' question of applying mechanisation. The sixty participants, from 19 African countries, concluded that in the foreseeable future, animal traction is likely to be the preferred system in rain-fed smallholder farming systems in African savannah zones. Motorised mechanisation was seen as more appropriate in conditions wherein there are large farms, the presence of irrigation (only 5 % of sub-Saharan African agriculture at present), and good marketing opportunities for increased and more regular production. The importance of mechanisation was also stressed in transport, crop and animal husbandry and post-harvest storage and food processing. Much attention will be needed for training and credit, to train blacksmiths and to develop forage management. Governments are expected to create a climate that will enable mechanisation to become a viable option, across a broad landscape of tax measures, land tenure rights, health, infrastructure (roads) and special assistance programmes for those areas at risk (including, presumably, dealing with people displaced by the gap-widening impact of mechanisation). In the frequent discussions now underway about strategies for mechanisation, it is recognised that little attention is paid to conservation tillage systems aimed at soil fertility, nor to gender issues ? participants at the CTA seminar admitted as much, noting that the promotion, adoption and benefits of mechanisation in sub-Saharan Africa are not gender-neutral. Women provide a high proportion of agricultural labour, yet ? as participation in the workshops confirmed ? mechanisation is still a male-dominated subject. Power for food security Another key issue, technical but central, is energy and fuel, and it is insufficiently addressed in strategy seminars. The push towards motorisation is almost bound to continue, with animal traction being seen as an intermediary step. Few mechanisation strategies face this, but they will soon be forced to, given that there are already acute fuel shortages in many rural areas. One approach to follow is to link mechanisation more closely with investment in energy systems which can provide energy for making agricultural equipment, motor fuels for operating it, and fuels for powering agro-processing plants, at the micro- and macro-levels. The challenge is to see how these developments for new sources of power and fuel can be made available for agricultural mechanisation. Mechanisation is not an end in itself, but a means of development. For those strategists who love to talk about empowerment, the challenge of getting power to the people, to the plough, and to the processing plant, is a tough one.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the last 30 years cotton-growing has {{expanded}} steadily in the savanna lands of francophone Africa. On the other hand, during the same period, production in the English-speaking countries has declined sharply. Now, however, all the cotton producers are threatened by plummeting world markets, low producer prices, increasingly expensive inputs and demanding quality requirements. In 1960 90 % of the cotton produced in sub-Saharan Africa came from the anglophone countries; this figure has now dropped to 55 %. Production in francophone Africa, on the other hand, has shown an increase and these countries now harvest nearly half the continent's cotton crop. Production in Sudan, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania and Nigeria, which for years were the top producers (apart from Egypt), dropped considerably in the 1970 s. Of all the English-speaking countries, only Zimbabwe has managed to increase its production. The rise in cotton production in francophone West Africa has been spectacular. The area under cultivation has doubled in the past three decades, and stands at a million hectares. Cotton now accounts for ten times the area it did in 1981. Central Africa, however, has seen a small decline. Seed cotton yields have also rocketed, thanks to the distribution of higher performance varieties, with production rising from 400 kg/ha in 1970 to more than 1000 kg/ha today. The ginning percentage (the percentage of fibres removed from the seed cotton) is also on the increase and Africa holds the world record with more than 40 %. All this has meant that since 1960 cotton production has increased 36 -fold in francophone West Africa, 13 -fold in Madagascar, and by a factor of 2. 8 in Central Africa. Anglophone Africa's sharp decline So what has caused such a disparity between neighbouring countries with very similar production potentials? The year 1976 saw the abolition of the UK-based Cotton Research Corporation (formerly the ECGC) after 55 years of continuous service to African and Caribbean countries. Although the Corporation was widely regarded as being one of the most cost-effective of Britain's development assistance agencies, the UK Government and other donors were unable to offer a financial package that would enable the Corporation to continue. This was partly a result of the emphasis being given to food crop development at the time, and partly a consequence of the overall lack of financial resources following the 1974 oil crisis. In many of the anglophone countries in which Corporation staff had worked, productivity subsequently faltered and the quality of the fibre failed to meet changing market needs. Production was not properly structured and seed was not distributed regularly for sowing; as a result it gradually lost its varietal purity. Also, infrastructures were not maintained and so vehicles, depots and ginneries were allowed to fall into disrepair. Marketing difficulties added to the decline. Farmers had to wait too long to be paid for their crop, credit was scarce, and many small-scale farmers were no longer in a position to buy necessities such as fertilizers and pesticides. Cotton, traditionally grown on an extensive basis, was no longer economically viable. Food crops became more attractive and cotton had less and less to offer the peasant farmer. More research effort has been put into food crops and new varieties have led to high production increases, for example, that of maize in Nigeria and rice in Tanzania. Food crops nowadays provide a more lucrative and reliable source of income, especially since the purchase price of cotton has fallen and the cost of fertilizers and pesticides has risen. For example, in 196670 Nigeria produced 50, 000 tonnes of cotton fibre, but only 10, 000 in 1985. Similarly, in Uganda the harvest has been reduced from 76, 000 t to 6, 000 t, in Mozambique it has dropped from 43, 000 to 11, 000 t, and in the Sudan from 205, 000 to 142, 000 t. It should not be forgotten, however, that these countries have gone through long periods of political and social upheaval and cotton was not the only crop to suffer. In most anglophone countries indifference on the part of the government has gone hand-in-hand with a reduction in the area under cotton cultivation. Producers are no longer interested in a crop which is not backed by research, training, organized marketing, and which is also costly in terms of labour and chemicals. Lately, however, the authorities in these countries seem to have woken up to the problem, and are initiating rescue programmes. A finely-tuned operation in French-speaking Africa The picture is very different in french-speaking Africa, where cotton is assuming an ever more important place in the economy. In countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad, cotton now accounts for 40 - 60 % of the export trade and 5 - 7 % of the gross domestic product. In Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Senegal, cotton is of secondary importance nationally but is the principal source of income for entire regions within these countries. In the savanna zones cotton is now the only crop which brings in regular cash-income. Its success is the result of highly efficient organization in the producing countries. The cotton companies were originally set up by the Compagnie Francaise pour le Développement des Textiles (CDFT), but were Africanized in the 1970 s. Generally speaking all cotton producing activities (production, processing, marketing), come under the aegis of these companies. This vertical integration of the activities ensures better operation and coordination. The farmers are well-informed and trained. They can buy their seed, fertilizers and pesticides on credit, and supply is constant. Technical advice and support are available to them throughout the season. Above all, they can be sure of a pre-set and guaranteed price for their crop, paid on delivery. The French institute for research on cotton and exotic textiles (IRCT) also offers support in the shape of improved seed varieties, improved spraying schedules and assessment of fertilizer requirements. This kind of help is largely responsible for the enormous increase in production levels of the past 30 years. The whole cotton network, which is highly organized, efficient and stable, with considerable human and material resources, instills confidence in the small-scale cotton producers. From being the 'Bwana's' compulsory crop, cotton has now become a crop of the people and attachment to it explains the amazing expansion of cotton in the savanna zones, where it has become the mainspring of development. Cotton the engine of development This increasing intensification of cotton growing has given farmers access to modern agricultural techniques, use of improved seed, crop protection products and mineral fertilizers, all of which are in general use today. In 1987 - 88, 77 % of the cotton producing land had fertilizer applications of 145 kg/ha, and 79 % received three applications of fertilizer. The income generated by cotton gives farmers the means of acquiring livestock and the necessary equipment for animal traction. This introduction to mechanization, which means that ploughing can be five times as fast, is most advanced in the cotton zones (53 % of all agricultural land in 198788). In Mali draft power is used on 90 % of all cotton-growing holdings. The cotton companies contributed significantly to the development of draft power by setting up animal training units, by popularizing the practice and by ensuring the availability of the necessary equipment. They also boosted progress towards intermediate mechanization by promoting small tractors and by undertaking their assembly, delivery, technical follow-up and after-sales service. However, the use of these tractors remains limited even though they were specifically designed for use in cotton growing. These companies have now extended their interests beyond the development of cotton growing alone. In most of the countries under discussion they have taken over the technical aspects and even the marketing and promoting of food crops. In Cameroon in 1987 SODECOTON supported the intensification of 38, 000 ha of maize, the same area of groundnuts and 35, 000 ha of sorghum. In Mali, a maize programme by the Compagnie Malienne pour le Développement des Textiles (CMDT), which was launched ten years ago in the south of the country, has become a model for the whole of West Africa. New, more productive varieties and more intensive growing methods have been introduced and these have given yields a considerable boost, reaching three tonnes/ha in the cotton zone. Because these yields exceeded needs for family consumption, outlets were needed, and CMDT assisted in the installation of mills which produce processed foodstuffs (flour, 'maize flour' and semolina) which are easier to market. A cotton buying-post Cotton-growing benefits the development of food crops in another way: crops thrive on the residue of the fertilizers used on the cotton and as a result the most productive farms are in the cotton-growing regions. Furthermore, cotton companies frequently undertake such improvement programmes as the construction of roads, tracks, schools and dispensaries. The cotton business has also given rise to professional associations for farmers, and these can be influential: recently some of these groups in Mali took part in CMDT board meetings. Another result of the presence of the cotton companies is improved infrastructure, the building of depots for seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and ginneries. In ten francophone African states in West Africa all cottonseed is ginned at the place of production and most is pressed for oil. The cottonseed-cake is usually used for cattle feed. On the other hand, only 10 % of the fibre is processed in local factories, with most going for export. The African fibre, which is harvested by hand, is much sought after for its quality, which gives it an advantage on the international market. Fall in world price Until 1985 cotton prices on the world market remained high and everyone benefited: the peasant farmers who were getting generous subsidies on chemicals made a comfortable income; the cotton companies made good profits; and the governments got substantial tax revenue. But in {{the course of}} a few years this has changed. In May 1984 a kilo of fibre sold at US$ 3. 18, while 15 months later the price had dropped to US$ 0. 94. The bottom [elf out of the market because a bumper harvest coincided with the arrival of highly competitive Chinese cotton. In one year alone the cotton companies announced losses of 100 billion FCFA which was too much to be absorbed by national budgets. Despite a slight improvement in the past year or so, the market is once again heading downward. This time a record crop in the USA and the sale of cotton from the former Soviet Union are responsible. For the African producers this situation has emphasized the downside of the present system. The current selling price of cotton means that the companies are no longer in a position to help the farmers financially. After 1986 reorganization was instituted in order to cut costs and some reductions have resulted from stringent economies. It has been accepted that the costs of farmer training and rural development can no longer be borne by cotton production alone. Subsidies for chemicals have been abolished and the peasant farmers have had to pay the market price. The village associations have gradually taken over marketing and the price paid to the producer has fallen sharply. Most countries have now fixed a minimum of approximately 80 - 100 FCFA for each season, although if the market price goes up the farmers get more. As a result, some farmers are now questioning the viability of cotton, and in some places less land is being used for the crop. Facing the challenge Reorganizing cotton production does not guarantee that it will be viable. Competition is increasingly fierce and to withstand it productivity will have to rise again, quality improve further and all cotton products will have to be profitable. Yields can be increased by much heavier applications of fertilizer, especially in densely-populated areas where there is no possibility of <b>land</b> <b>lying</b> <b>fallow.</b> But farmers cannot afford more fertilizer when their income has fallen and research is under way to find a less expensive solution, perhaps a closer link between agricultural and pastoral systems. Other cost-cutting exercises which are being investigated include adjusting the timing of sprayings to suit individual situations, using different types of insecticides and reducing the quantity of pesticides used. Quality control is becoming more and more stringent and the producing countries must take account of this if they wish to meet market needs and sell their cotton at a good price. The new spinning method, (called 'open end') where the lap or sliver is processed into yarn by feeding it through a disc which spins at 70, 000 rpm, can be used only for short, fine, tough fibres which are completely clean. New measuring techniques monitor fibre quality extremely rapidly. Another approach to increasing the competitiveness of cotton is the development of 'landless cotton, the by-products of which have more uses than those of conventional varieties (see Box). Countries or regions whose economies rely on cotton will have to put much more effort into improved production and diversification if they are to survive in a changing market.

60|$|The {{answer is}} a more {{profound}} one than you would at first imagine. Plants discovered the grand principle of the rotation of crops long before man did.

Well, natural selection forced the same discovery upon the plants themselves long before the farmer had dreamed of its existence. For plants, being, in the strictest sense, 'rooted to the spot,' absolutely require that all their needs should be supplied quite locally. Hence, from the very beginning, those plants which scattered their seeds widest throve the best; while those which merely dropped them on the ground under their own shadow, and on soil exhausted by their own previous demands upon it, fared ill in the struggle for life against their more discursive competitors. The result has been {{that in the long run}} few species have survived, except those which in one way or another arranged beforehand for the dispersal of their seeds and fruits over fresh and unoccupied areas of plain or hillside.|$|R

The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30-square-meter mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.The peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the <b>land</b> to <b>lie</b> <b>fallow,</b> which reduces soil fertility. This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields. Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced. The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working {{the land and the}} productivity drops further.|$|R

Mr. Teak, who did the digging, was the first to realize it, but his friend, pointing out the suspicions that might be engendered by a sudden cessation of labour, induced him to persevere.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the Linear Pottery culture dates to around 5500 BC. It appears to have spread westwards along {{the valley of the}} river Danube and interacted with the cultures of Atlantic Europe when they reached the Paris Basin.Danubian I peoples cleared forests and cultivated fertile loess soils from the Balkans to the Low Countries and the Paris Basin. They made LBK pottery and kept domesticated cows, pigs, dogs, sheep and goats. The diagnostic tool of the culture is the Shoe-last celt, a kind of long thin stone adze which was used to fell trees and sometimes as a weapon, evidenced by the skulls found at Talheim, Neckar in Germany and Schletz in Austria. Settlements consisted of longhouses. According to a theory by Eduard Sangmeister, these settlements were abandoned, possibly as fertile land was exhausted, and then reoccupied perhaps when the <b>land</b> had <b>lain</b> <b>fallow</b> for long enough. In contrast, Peter Modderman and Jens Lüning believe the settlements were constantly inhabited, with individual families using specific plots (Hofplätze). They also imported spondylus shells from the Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|Miry usually {{practiced the}} common-field system, {{in which all}} peasants grew the same crop in the same part of the mir's arable at the same time. Thus the whole harvest on a {{particular}} area could be gathered at the same time. This was necessary because of the peasants' custom of pasturing their livestock on the stubble. To preserve soil fertility on the arable, the mir generally employed a crop-rotation with fallow. The distribution of different crops would be `cycled' around from year to year. The most widespread system in use was the three-course or triennial rotation. One-third of the land was dedicated to winter grain (rye or winter wheat), another third to spring grain (oats or spring wheat) and the remainder lay fallow. [...] Other crops (e.g. legumes, vetches) were occasionally grown with the grain and {{took part in the}} same cycle. The three-course rotation was an inefficient system, one-third of the <b>land</b> always <b>lying</b> <b>fallow.</b> During the later 19th and earlier 20th centuries a start was made in introducing improved rotations with reduced or eliminated fallow (see `Improving Agriculture' below).|$|R
5000|$|The Torah {{portrays the}} Sabbath concept {{both in terms}} of resting on the seventh day and {{allowing}} <b>land</b> to <b>lie</b> <b>fallow</b> during each seventh year. [...] The motivation is described as going beyond a sign and remembrance of Yahweh's original rest during the creation week and extends to a concern that one's servants, family, and livestock be able to rest and be refreshed from their work. [...] In addition to the instruction to rest on each seventh day and seventh year, periods of seven days are often relevant aspects of Biblical instructions. For example, the quarantine period for suspected skin diseases after initial examination by a priest was seven days, after which the priest would re-examine the skin and pronounce the person clean or unclean. [...] Other special days included the day after the seventh Sabbath, {{the first day of the}} seventh month, the day of ritual cleansing after being healed from an unclean disease or other event bringing uncleanness. [...] In addition, in the battle of Jericho, Joshua commanded the army to march around Jericho each day for seven consecutive days and to march around Jericho seven times on the seventh day.|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of fallowing the Vertisols in Madhya Pradesh, Central India {{during the rainy}} season (kharif) and growing crops on residual soil moisture thereafter (postrainy season or rabi) has been in vogue for several years. After the successful introduction of soybean in the state, which accounts for 87 % of the area and 83 % production of the crop in the whole country, it was assumed that rainy season fallow has declined. To delineate rainy season fallows in the state, data obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite were analyzed. A deductive approach including delineation of agricultural land and forests from temporal satellite data was employed to identify kharif fallow. Three sets of satellite data corresponding to three periods, namely mid-kharif, late kharif, and rabi season were used. While mid-kharif season satellite data provides the information on agricultural <b>lands,</b> which were <b>lying</b> unutilized along with those agricultural lands that have been supporting crops, the satellite data of rabi season, on the other hand, exhibits the spatial distribution pattern of the land supporting rabi crops. These lands include the areas, which were <b>lying</b> <b>fallow</b> during kharif season, and are now supporting crops. In contrast, the satellite data acquired during late kharif season showed the agricultural <b>lands</b> that were <b>lying</b> <b>fallow</b> during kharif season and the areas where kharif crops were planted...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. Members of the Suborder Microchiroptera consume {{large numbers}} of insects. When large enough numbers of these bats are present in {{agricultural}} areas, the need for insecticides can be reduced significantly. The ZZ 2 Tomato Farms in Mooketsi and the Secrabje Farm in Waterpoort, in the Limpopo Province were chosen as study sites. Although ZZ 2 focuses on the production of tomatoes, both farms produce a variety of vegetables and fruit. These farms were chosen because the management of both have shown a commitment to conservation and attempt to minimise {{their impact on the}} environment. Bat species indigenous to the study areas were captured by means of mist nets for identification purposes. Basic morphological data of captured specimens were collected and recorded. Their roosting behaviour and preferences were studied by visiting diurnal roosts in the two study sites. Microclimatic measurements were taken in roosts occupied by Chaerephon pumilus, Mops condylurus and Taedarida aegyptiaca. Microclimatic measurements were also done in bat houses designed for the housing of bats in agricultural areas. Results suggest that other factors, additional to temperature and relative humidity, contribute to the success and probability of bat house occupancy by bats. Existing roosts in man-made structures such as roofs, can successfully be enhanced to stimulate increase in colony size. Bat activities were determined in agricultural areas and adjacent natural habitats by means of recordings of the echolocation calls of the different bat Families. These were compared to the occurrence of nocturnal flying insect orders that were captured in light traps at the same localities. Of the bat species studied, a positive correlation between increased bat activity and higher number of insects, including pest species, was found. It seems as if the Molossidae has the greatest potential to be utilised in the control of insect pests of agricultural areas in the Limpopo of the bat species studied. A holistic approach favouring insectivorous bats on farms is recommended. This can be done i. a. through the conservation of abundant areas of natural vegetation adjacent to the agricultural areas which would provide foraging for bats during winter, periods of drought or when the <b>lands</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow.</b> The excessive and injudicious use of insecticides, which has a negative effect on bats, counteracts the beneficial and cheap alternative of natural insect pest control provided by insectivorous bats...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cultivation}} of rice in Bangladesh {{varies according to}} seasonal changes in the water supply. The largest harvest is aman, occurring in November and December and accounting {{for more than half}} of annual production. Some rice for the aman harvest is sown in the spring through the broadcast method, matures during the summer rains, and is harvested in the fall. [...] The higher yielding method involves starting the seeds in special beds and transplanting during the summer monsoon. The second harvest is aus, involving traditional strains but more often including high-yielding, dwarf varieties. Rice for the aus harvest is sown in March or April, benefits from April and May rains, matures during in the summer rain, and is harvested during the summer. With the increasing use of irrigation, there has been a growing focus on another rice-growing season extending during the dry season from October to March. The production of this boro rice, including high-yield varieties, expanded rapidly until the mid-1980s, when production leveled off at just below 4 million tons. [...] Where irrigation is feasible, it is normal for fields throughout Bangladesh to produce rice for two harvests annually. Between rice-growing seasons, farmers will do everything possible to prevent the <b>land</b> from <b>lying</b> <b>fallow</b> and will grow vegetables, peanuts, pulses, or oilseeds if water and fertilizer are available.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in my}} {{eleventh}} {{year when}} we moved from Portsmouth to Friar's Oak, a little Sussex village {{to the north of}} Brighton, which was recommended to us by my uncle, Sir Charles Tregellis, one of whose grand friends, Lord Avon, had had his seat near there. The reason of our moving was that living was cheaper in the country, and that it was easier for my mother to keep up the appearance of a gentlewoman when away from the circle of those to whom she could not refuse hospitality. They were trying times those to all save the farmers, who made such profits that they could, as I have heard, afford to let half their <b>land</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow,</b> while living like gentlemen upon the rest. Wheat was at a hundred and ten shillings a quarter, and the quartern loaf at one and ninepence. Even in the quiet of the cottage of Friar's Oak we could scarce have lived, were it not that in the blockading squadron in which my father was stationed there was the occasional chance of a little prize-money. The line-of-battle ships themselves, tacking on and off outside Brest, could earn nothing save honour; but the frigates in attendance made prizes of many coasters, and these, as is the rule of the service, were counted as belonging to the fleet, and their produce divided into head-money. In this manner my father was able to send home enough to keep the cottage and to pay for me at the day school of Mr. Joshua Allen, where for four years I learned all that he had to teach. It was at Allen's school that I first knew Jim Harrison, Boy Jim as he has always been called, the nephew of Champion Harrison of the village smithy. I can see him as he was in those days with great, floundering, half-formed limbs like a Newfoundland puppy, and a face that set every woman's head round as he passed her. It was in those days that we began our lifelong friendship, a friendship which still in our waning years binds us closely as two brothers. I taught him his exercises, for he never loved the sight of a book, and he in turn made me box and wrestle, tickle trout on the Adur, and snare rabbits on Ditching Down, for his hands were as active as his brain was slow. He was two years my elder, however, so that, long before I had finished my schooling, he had gone to help his uncle at the smithy.|$|R
40|$|South Asia {{is one of}} {{the major}} rice {{producing}} regions of the world, with about 50 million ha under its cultivation. Much of this area has a single crop per year; usually rainy season rice and no crop is grown after the rains. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) alone in South Asia occupies about 8 million ha under rice during the rainy season. Approximately, 2. 5 million ha of rainfed rice land in IGP is left fallow. The large and growing population of the region especially in the IGP requires ever-increasing quantities of locally available food grains. The large <b>land</b> areas that <b>lie</b> <b>fallow</b> with adequate moisture to grow a second crop for much of the year are particular cause of concern in IGP. Subbarao et al. (2001) estimated 14 million ha rice fallow lands in South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and India). However, these studies may under-represent the true total, because it failed to identify any rice fallow lands in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh in India, and the current study identified nearly 17, 000 ha of rice fallows in the same district. If this figure were to be added, the total area would stand at 36, 904 ha (Fig. 1) ...|$|R

40|$|MM - P&DMThe Department of Land Affairs {{has been}} given a {{constitutional}} mandate to redistribute 30 per cent of agricultural land from white farmers to black people in South Africa. Since its inception, land reform has been heavily criticized for its failure to produce a new farming class among blacks, for contributing to the current food shortages, and to job losses in the agricultural sector. Government has bought tracts of land for blacks over the past thirteen years, but most of this <b>land</b> is <b>lying</b> <b>fallow.</b> Although a number of reasons are given for the collapse of land reform projects, this research was aimed at gaining {{a deeper understanding of the}} contribution of the communal land tenure systems in the form of Communal Property Institutions (CPIs), which are being used by land reform beneficiaries for land-holding and management purposes. Qualitative research methodology was used in the research. Two land reform projects were selected in the Nkangala District of Mpumalanga Province, namely the New Life Kibbutz Communal Trust and the Simangwe Poultry and Distribution cc. The research found that the grant system used by the Department of Land Affairs for land acquisition purposes forced people to mobilize one another into groups of varying sizes in order to get enough grants to pay for the land. This phenomenon is commonly known as ‘rent-a-crowd’. Conflict within these groups is rife, making it difficult for people to work together. Individual rights within the groups are not properly defined and/or understood by the members, making it difficult for them to work the land individually or even to sell their rights. The constitutions for the groups are often poorly drafted and barely understood by the beneficiaries themselves. v Any farmers would be willing to invest in their land if they are able to claim its ownership. Thus, for land reform to work, the manner in which land is held and managed needs to be reviewe...|$|R
