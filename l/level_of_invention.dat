50|$|However, Semele {{remains a}} work of high quality. As the late Lord Harewood put it: the music of Semele is so full of variety, the recitative so expressive, the {{orchestration}} so inventive, the characterization so apt, the general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> so high, the action so full of credible situation and incident - in a word, the piece {{as a whole is}} so suited to the operatic stage - that one can only suppose its neglect to have been due to an act of abnegation on the part of opera companies.|$|E
50|$|Almira {{is a mix}} of spectacle, as in {{the opening}} {{coronation}} scene and the masque in the third act, dance, comedy and drama. Paul O'Dette, artistic co-director of the Boston Early Music Festival, where the opera was staged in 2013, says of this very early work by the teenaged Handel:From the first page of the overture, it just overflows with genius and invention. You can’t believe that an overture of this brilliance could have been written as Handel’s first attempt, because most composers never achieve this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> after a whole career.|$|E

5000|$|Steinbeck's {{narrative}} {{has been}} challenged as partly fictionalized.

He later self-published his analysis in a 2012 book, titled Dogging Steinbeck. Steigerwald concluded that Travels contains such a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> and Steinbeck took such great liberty with the truth, that the work has limited claim to being non-fiction.|$|E
50|$|Laroche's comment {{can serve}} as a useful {{reminder}} that what may now sound conventional was taken {{at the time it was}} written as something very fresh and original. Tchaikovsky does not plumb any new emotional depths in this work, but his <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> is at its most inspired. The Third Suite most notably explores further the melodic and orchestral possibilities exposed in its two predecessors as well as for Tchaikovsky's return to large-scale variation form. The final movement, Tema con variazioni, is a wonderful example of the composer's creative genius and it is a locus classicus of scoring. During Tchaikovsky's lifetime it was not uncommon for him to be asked to perform this finale without the rest of the suite, such was its universal popularity; and the finale alone has been performed numerous times since.|$|E

40|$|With {{advances}} in computing {{power and the}} processes of globalization, the analytical and engineering science skills that contribute to innovation are becoming a commodity, and the activities of research and development—and innovation—are being outsourced. These trends leave the creative and systems integrative skills of engineering design as the value-added part of innovation. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge, termed mass innovation, which {{can be defined as}} expanding and diffusing innovation activities to the general population through connecting inventors and entrepreneurs with the engineering tools and services needed to assess and realize their novel design concepts. As part of mass innovation, this paper presents the development of an approach for automatic function interpretation, and an example is given, in the context of sustainable design, of the application of automatic function interpretation and automatic classification of <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> to a means for producing compressed earth blocks. The method for automatic function interpretation is based on text extraction, natural language processing using a parser, and semantic definition of functional requirements and design parameters. The classification of <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> is based on a machine-learning model using inputs based on patent citation measures...|$|E
30|$|Of {{the four}} {{parameters}} {{that can be}} used to construct S-curves (see “Big data meets domain knowledge: the functional bibliometric analysis” section), we decided to study the number of inventions over time, since the other three parameters (profitability, performance and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention)</b> are not as easy to determine or assess. On the contrary the number of inventions is directly related to the number of patents and scientific papers, which are both already gathered in fully accessible and exhaustive databases. In particular, the study of patents has the highest likelihood of providing complete and accurate results.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{applies the}} ideas of Alekseev and Meinrenken’s Noncommutative Chern-Weil Theory to {{describe}} a completely combinatorial and constructive proof of the Wheeling Theorem. In this theory, {{the crux of the}} proof is, essentially, the familiar demonstration that a characteristic class does not depend on the choice of connection made to construct it. To a large extent this work may be viewed as an exposition of the details of some elements of Alekseev and Meinrenken’s theory written for Kontsevich integral specialists. Our goal was a presentation with full combinatorial detail in the setting of Jacobi diagrams- to achieve this goal a certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> proved necessary...|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{analysis}} conducted on the basis of an indicative approach the author reveals the system of indicators as a characteristic of the patent process – the term which is argued in the article. These indicators allowed grouping Russian regions by the efficiency of patent dynamics. The patent dynamics is a complex phenomenon and it is understood, firstly, as the ratio of the filed applications to granted patents, secondly, as the efficiency of patent dynamics on implementing production, thirdly, as the ratio of granted patents to implemented patents and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> activity, and fourthly, as the ratio of efficiency of patent dynamics on implementing production to overall patent dynamics efficiency. The author reveals high and relatively high values for these indicators {{in the vast majority of}} Russian regions. The indicators for all Russian regions are calculated on the basis of the proposed estimation technique, and their grouping is performed. It was found that the dynamics of the patent cannot be an indicator of innovative activity in the region. This index can be used only in conjunction with other content that more fully reflects the state of the elements of the patent process. The author proves that in areas with high population density the direct connection between created and implemented patents is not observed. The article stresses that the innovators are not enough numerous to meet the innovation needs of the economy, and the created technologies are not always demanded in production. It was revealed that in the regions of Russia there are no prerequisites for the development of the patent process due to the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> activity...|$|E

40|$|In the start, an aproach of the {{situation}} regarding the objectification of innovation is given (from the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> and patents), through design to commercialization of new products (development and manufacturing) in accordance with advanced research and correct implementation of technological innovations. It shows the aspects of the integral system of industrial and municipal waste (there are biomass after the landscaping, green areas and parks), {{in the process of}} industrial production and processes which comprise the municipal utilities with waste treatments. Some of crucial elements of environmental policy and environmental objectives are emphasised. An algorithm of the activities of the work process regarding the management of solid waste-valuable raw material is given. It was pointed out that waste management is carried out, according to the requirements of legislation and the specifics of functioning of public enterprises and companies (including SMEs).

50|$|Taken as a whole, Lumsdaine's {{output is}} remarkably {{consistent}} in its <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> beauty and daring. If there are perhaps works in which length {{is not always}} justified by the material, these are in a small minority. A typical Lumsdaine work will be a serious, intense and sensuously exhilarating experience for performers and listeners alike. Right from his earliest acknowledged work, he has refused to use pure constructivism {{as an end in}} itself. Expressive honesty, a keen ear for the wonders of sound and an obvious passion for the world around us are the dominating characteristics of an output which is surely overdue to be recognised as one of the finest of his generation, and by any Australian-born composer to date.|$|R

40|$|Condit, Prelli, and Depew and Lyne offer useful {{taxonomies}} {{of scholarship}} in {{the rhetoric of}} science, technology and medicine (RSTM), and once again provoke questions about the distinctiveness of a rhetorical approach. Rhetorical studies examine the choices rhetors make at all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> (e. g., lines of argument, arrangement, terminology, visuals). But rhetoricians have not been clear in defining the distinctive contribution of their approach, and scholars in related fields do not routinely access or acknowledge rhetorical studies. There are also impediments to framing rhetorical studies for scientists and practitioners: the term rhetoric still has negative connotations in science publications, and rhetorical concepts like cooperation and reputation are addressed by other fields, creating a competing discourse. Nevertheless, RSTM will expand, and new directions for scholarship include visual rhetoric and the new persuasive practices brought about by online publication...|$|R
