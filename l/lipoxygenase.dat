50|$|Two <b>lipoxygenases</b> may act {{in series}} to make di-hydroxy or tri-hydroxy {{products}} that have activities quite different than either lipoxyenases' products. This serial metabolism may occur in different cell types that express {{only one of}} the two <b>lipoxygenases</b> in a process termed transcellular metabolism. For example, ALOX5 and ALOX15 or, alternatively, ALOX5 and ALOX12 can act serially to metabolize arachidonic acid into lipoxins (see 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#Further metabolism of 15(S)-HpETE, 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HpETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15-oxo-ETE and lipoxin#Biosynthesis) while ALOX15 and possibly ALOX15B can act with ALOX5 to metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to resolvin D's (see resolvin#Production).|$|R
2500|$|Human ALOX15 was {{initially}} named arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase or 15-lipoxygenase but subsequent studies uncovered a second human enzyme with 15-lipoxygenase activity {{as well as}} various non-human mammalian Alox15 enzymes that {{are closely related to}} and therefore orthologs of human ALOX15. Many of the latter Alox15 enzymes nonetheless possess predominantly or exclusively 12-lipoxygenase rather than 15-lipoxygenase activity. Consequently, human ALOX15 is now referred to as arachidonate-15-lipoxygenase-1, 15-lipoxygenase-1, 15-LOX-1, 15-LO-1, human 12/15-lipoxygenase, leukocyte-type arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, or arachidonate omega-6 <b>lipoxygenase.</b> [...] The second discovered human 15-lipoxygenase, a product of the ALOX15B gene, is termed ALOX15B, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase 2, 15-lipoxygenase-2, 15-LOX-2, 15-LO-2, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type II, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, second type, and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase; and mouse, rat, and rabbit rodent orthologs of human ALOX15, which share 74-81% amino acid identity with the human enzyme, are commonly termed Alox15, 12/15-lipoxygenase, 12/15-LOX, or 12/15-LO).|$|E
2500|$|The tuber is {{produced}} in one growing season and used to perennate the plant and {{as a means of}} propagation. [...] When fall comes, the above-ground structure of the plant dies, but the tubers survive over winter underground until spring, when they regenerate new shoots that use the stored food in the tuber to grow. [...] As the main shoot develops from the tuber, the base of the shoot close to the tuber produces adventitious roots and lateral buds on the shoot. The shoot also produces stolons that are long etiolated stems. [...] The stolon elongates during long days with the presence of high auxins levels that prevent root growth off of the stolon. [...] Before new tuber formation begins, the stolon must be a certain age. The enzyme <b>lipoxygenase</b> makes a hormone, jasmonic acid, which is involved in the control of potato tuber development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second step}} in this reaction, the {{conversion}} of 12(S)-HpETE to HxA3 and HxB3, may be catalyzed by ALOX12 as an intrinsic property of the enzyme. [...] Based on gene knockout studies, however, the epidermal <b>lipoxygenase,</b> ALOXE3, or more correctly, its mouse ortholog Aloxe3, appears responsible for converting 12(S)-HpETE to HxB3 in mouse skin and spinal tissue. It is suggested that ALOXE3 contributes in part or whole {{to the production of}} HxB3 and perhaps other hepoxilins by tissues where it is expressed such as the skin. [...] Furthermore, hydroperoxide-containing unsaturated fatty acids can rearrange non-enzymatically to form a variety of epoxyalcohol isomers. The 12(S)-HpETE formed in tissues, it is suggested, may similar rearrange non-enzymatically to form HxA3 and HXB3. Unlike the products made by ALOX12 and ALOXE3, which are stereospecific in forming only HxA3 and HxB3, however, this non-enzymatic production of hepoxilins may form a variety of hepoxilin isomers and occur as an artifact of tissue processing. Finally, cellular peroxidases readily and rapidly reduce 12(S)-HpETE to its hydroxyl analog, 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE; see 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; this reaction competes with the hepoxilin-forming reaction and in cells expressing very high peroxidase activity may be responsible for blocking the formation of the hepoxilins.|$|E

The two groups described the samples using similar terms. The traditional users preferred the control soy milk and lipoxygenase-free tofu while the nontraditional users preferred the lipoxygenase-free soymilk with no preference for tofu. In a separate study, a trained descriptive taste panel compared the odor of soymilk and tofu from control soybeans or those lacking lipoxygenase- 1 and lipoxygenase- 2 (Lx 12) or all three isomers (Lx 123). The rancid/grassy odor was rated the lowest in Lx 123 products, followed by Lx 12 products with the control products given the highest rating. The Lx 12 and Lx 123 products were also sweeter and less bitter than the controls.

2500|$|Lipoxygenases (LOXs): 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX or ALOX5) initiates the {{metabolism}} of {{arachidonic acid}} to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HpETE) which then may be rapidly reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) or further metabolized to the leukotrienes (e.g. LTB4 and LTC4); 5-HETE may be oxidized to 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE). In similar fashions, 15-lipoxygenase (15-lipoxygenase 1, 15-LOX, 15-LOX1, or ALOX15) initiates the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 15-HpETE, 15-HETE, eoxins, 8,15-dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 8,15-DiHETE), and 15-oxo-ETE and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX or ALOX12) initiates the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 12-HpETE, 12-HETE, hepoxilins, and 12-oxo-ETE. These enzymes also initiate the [...] metabolism of; a) eicosatetraenoic acid to analogs of the arachidonic acid metabolites that contain 5 rather than four double bonds, e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (5-HEPE), LTB5, LTC5, 5-oxo-EPE, 15-HEPE, and 12-HEPE; b) the three double bond-containing dihomo-γ-linolenic acid to products that contain 3 double bonds, e.g. 8-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (8-HETrE), 12-HETrE, and 15-HETrE (this fatty acid cannot {{be converted to}} leukotrienes); and the three double bond-containing mead acid (by ALOX5) to 5-hydroperoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-HpETrE), 5-HETrE, and 5-oxo-HETrE. In the most studied of these pathways, ALOX5 metabolizes eicosapentaenoic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid (5-HpEPE), 5-HEPE, and LTB5, and 5-oxo-EPE, {{all of which are}} less active than there arachidonic acid analogs. Since eicosapentaenoic acid competes with arachidonic acid for ALOX5, production of the eicosapentaenoate metabolites leads to a reduction in the eicosatetraenoate metabolites and therefore reduction in the latter metabolites' signaling. The initial mono-hydroperoxy and mono-hydroxy products made by the aforementioned lipoxygenases have their hydroperosy and hydroxyl residues positioned in the S chiral configuration and are more properly termed 5S-HpETE, 5S-HETE, 12S-HpETE, 12S-HETE, 15S-HpETE and, 15S-HETE. ALOX12B (i.e. arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type) forms R chirality products, i.e. 12R-HpETE and 12R-HETE. Similarly, ALOXE3 (i.e. epidermis-type <b>lipoxygenase</b> 3 or eLOX3) metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12R-HpETE and 12R-HETE; however these are minor products that this enzyme forms only under a limited set of conditions.
