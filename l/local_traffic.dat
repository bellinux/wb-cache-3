5|$|Reading {{was a major}} {{staging point}} on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol. This road still carries <b>local</b> <b>traffic,</b> but has now been {{replaced}} for long distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for <b>local</b> <b>traffic.</b> The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road. National Express Coaches run out of Reading Coachway, at Junction 12 of the M4. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving {{one of which is}} High Bridge.|$|E

The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge {{and to allow}} for dedicated <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> and bridge traffic lanes.

5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council as it could affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were the largest ever proposed in London and would affect far more than <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> due to its Inner Ring Road status.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} years of the Stadtbahn, many trains {{previously}} terminating at the old terminuses Lehrter Bahnhof, Görlitzer Bahnhof or Potsdamer Bahnhof operated via the Stadtbahn to reduce the load on the terminus stations. By the end of the 19th century, however, most of these train runs had to terminate at their old destination stations again due to the increasing <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the road}} was {{bypassed}} in 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then U.S. Route99 (US99), to handle increased traffic and remove many curves. The four-lane US99 was completed in 1953 and replaced by a freeway, Interstate5 (I-5) around 1968. The portion {{of the road}} within the Angeles National Forest {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1997, following the efforts of Harrison Scott. Much of the road has been closed by the U.S. Forest Service; other remnants of the road are used by <b>local</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The road's design {{varies from}} six lane dual {{carriageway}} to urban streets, {{the latter of}} which contribute to traffic congestion in London and are regularly featured on <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> reports, particularly at Henlys Corner and Bounds Green in Northwest London. The uncertainty of development has caused urban decay and property blight along its route, and led to criticism over its poor pollution record. Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities surrounding the North Circular.|$|E

5|$|When the National Freeway {{was built}} in western Maryland {{paralleling}} the old National Road, parts of US40 were bypassed. The part of the bypassed road between Keyser's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US40, and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became Maryland Route 144 (MD144) and U.S. Route 40 Scenic. Although Alt US40 has diminished in importance from its original status as the National Road {{with the construction of}} I-68, it remains an important route for <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> and serves as the Main Streets of Grantsville and Frostburg.|$|E
5|$|After {{intersecting}} SR163, {{also known}} as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21lanes wide. Eastbound SR56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.|$|E
5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the electrified commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for <b>local</b> <b>traffic,</b> with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup and Partners {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for <b>local</b> <b>traffic,</b> allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> and for Blue Water Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin {{at the end of}} 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US1/9) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E

5|$|The four lane road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges.|$|E
5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed. The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E
5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of <b>local</b> <b>traffic,</b> were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E
