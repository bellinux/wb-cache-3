40|$|Glass {{is largely}} used in {{buildings}} as a novel construction material. Due to the intrinsic mechanical properties of such material, however, specific design recommendations are demanded {{in order to}} offer appropriate “fail-safe” requirements. This {{is especially true in}} the case of load-bearing structural glass elements where redundancy, stability and residual resistance should be guaranteed. In this regard, based also on a past research effort, the paper experimentally investigates the structural performance of full-scale square hollow glass columns, whose resisting cross-section consists of four adhesively joined <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Impact tests are carried out on in-plane compressed specimens, including both a reference undamaged column and a deliberately, preliminary broken specimen. The effects of multiple impact test configurations (inclusive of various release configurations for the impact mass as well as type of impact body) are hence emphasized, with critical discussion of the observed overall results and failure mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Glass {{has been}} {{overwhelmingly}} used for windows and facades for modern constructions. Nevertheless, {{due to its}} relatively low tensile strength and mostly brittle behaviour, compared to other structural members, glass windows/facades {{are one of the}} most fragile components for a building envelop that are always associated with vast casualties in a blast incident. Several researches have been carried out to study the performance of glass windows and facades under blast loading, which include laboratory investigations on glass dynamic properties; analytical solutions for the analysis of the response of monolithic and <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> under shock; numerical modelling of window vulnerability to air blast waves; laboratory or field blast tests to validate the prediction and performance of glass windows and assemblies, as well as the efficiency of possible mitigation and retrofitting solutions for novel or existing glass claddings. This paper presents a review on the state of art of analysis and design of glass window/facade system under blast loading, with evidence of available experimental outcomes, design methods and trends, open challenges...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{minimization}} {{problems are}} presented that determine parameters for best practice single {{degree of freedom}} (SDOF) models, based on the blast response of structural members. The inputs for the model are dynamic experimental data as obtained from pressure and laser deflection measurements. The first approach compares model and experimental deflection and minimizes {{the differences between the}} two. Within this approach, a method is introduced to determine the best parameters of typical structural resistance functions for SDOF models. Examples for the determination of up to three parameters are given. The second approach uses a set of basic functions in terms of deflection and velocity to describe the resistance function as a linear combination of functions. Using experimental data, a matrix equation is obtained from the single degree of freedom force equation. Taking advantage of the minimization conditions, a second matrix equation is derived, then numerically inverted and solved for the response basis function expansion parameters. In a systematic way the response function may be improved, e. g. by adding more terms to polynomial basis functions. Both procedures determine SDOF and in particular response function parameters from dynamic data and also indicate whether they are well selected. Combining parameter data of multiple events and failure criteria, the overall model and failure behavior are determined in a P-I diagram for the example of a standardized <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>pane...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is the {{implementation}} and experimental investigation of different active structural acoustic control (ASAC) concepts for the reduction of interior noise in an automobile passen-ger compartment. For the control experiments, a medium-class test car was used, which had been equipped with an active windshield. The active windshield consists of the serialproduction <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> augmented with piezoceramic patch-transducers applied to theblackened rim of the wind-shield. A multi-reference test provided measurement data for the identification of a local discrete-time state-space model (SSM). The subsequent acquisition of frequency response functions (FRF) by way of using the same actuators but measuring on a much finer grid provided the database for the formulation of a least-squares problem to derive a global system model. Based on the local and global discrete-time SSMs, different controllers were designed and experimentally realized. The comparison of the vibration levels in open- and closed-loop showed a global reduction of 5 dB to 7 dB in the acoustically relevant frequency band containing {{the second and third}} structural resonance of the windshield system. The occurrence of complex operational deflection shapes (ODS) was identified as the main limitation con-cerning the disturbance rejection of the active system. The acoustic performance of the ASAC system is reflected in a reduction up to 15 dB in sound pressure level (SPL) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{load bearing}} {{capacity}} of a laminated glass pane changes with temperature. In blast protection, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> with a Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) interlayer are usually employed. The post-crack response of the laminated pane {{is determined by the}} interlayer material response and its bond to the glass plies. An experimental study has been performed {{to determine the effects of}} temperature on the post cracked response of laminated glass at a test rate of 1 m/s for PVB thicknesses of 0. 76 mm, 1. 52 mm and 2. 28 mm. Tensile tests were carried out on single cracked and randomly cracked samples in a temperature range of 0  °C– 60  °C. Photoelasticity observation and high speed video recording were used to capture the delamination in the single cracked tests. Competing mechanisms of PVB compliance and the adhesion between the glass and PVB, were revealed. The adhesion showed an increase at lower temperatures, but the compliance of the PVB interlayer was reduced. Based on the interlayer thickness range tested, the post-crack response of laminated glass is shown to be thickness dependent...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of two full-scale experimental tests {{carried out on}} square hollow glass columns under low velocity impacts, the paper aims to further assess via Finite Element models the structural performance of such structural systems. In them, the resisting cross-section consists of four adhesively bonded <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Adhesive joints are also used for the connection between glass columns and top/bottom restraints. As a result, careful consideration in the analysis and design of these innovative systems is required, to guarantee appropriate fail-safe design principles for a typically tensile brittle material, {{as well as to}} account for possible accidental or exceptional loading conditions. Simplified but computationally efficient FE models are validated in the paper towards the available full-scale test results. Key aspects in the observed overall performances under low velocity impact are then emphasized, with careful consideration for several loading configurations, including variations in the release distance for the impacting mass {{as well as in the}} type of impact (hard/soft body). In conclusion, a FE sensitivity analysis is also carried out, giving preliminary evidence of the effects of some main input parameters on the overall performance of the examined systems, including possible localized damage in glass, as well as geometrical and mechanical features in the column restraints...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> {{are widely}} adopted as blast-resistant glass windows to {{mitigate}} the hazard from ejecting fractured glass fragments. The response of laminated glass windows under blast loads is often predicted by equivalent static analysis or simplified equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) analysis. The equivalent SDOF and equivalent static analyses are also respectively adopted in UFC and ASTM design guide for glass window designs. Owing to the inherent problems, the SDOF analysis can only predict the global responses of glass windows and the predictions are not necessarily always satisfactory. Therefore the accuracy and applicability of the SDOF analysis is sometimes questioned. Often numerical simulations and/or experimental tests have {{to be carried out}} for reliable predictions of laminated glass window responses to blast loads. In this study, experimental tests on laminated glass windows subjected to impact and blast loads were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of available analyses and design methods. Pendulum impact tests were conducted first on laminated panes of various thicknesses. Full-scale field blast tests were performed on laminated glass windows of dimension 1. 5 m × 1. 2 m. Glass pane deflections were monitored by mechanical linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) and high-speed cameras. The responses of the tested windows are compared with the estimations of SDOF models and design standards in this paper. Available blast testing data by other researchers are also included together with the current testing data to evaluate the accuracy of the SDOF and equivalent static analyses defined in the design guides. The adequacy of these simplified approaches in predicting laminated glass window responses to blast loads is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{characteristic}} high slenderness ratios, monolithic and <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> elements in bending are frequently subjected to lateral–torsional buckling phenomena. As regards <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams or <b>panes,</b> in particular, {{the effects of}} temperature variations or the load duration represent only some aspects that contribute to make complex the buckling response, already conditioned by slenderness ratios and by limited tensile strengths. In this context, the load bearing capacity of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams in out-of-plane bending is investigated through a simple analytical model developed {{on the basis of}} Newmark’s theory, regarding the flexural response of composite beams with deformable connection. Some buckling curves are presented to illustrate how a combination of weathering variations, initial imperfections or particular load conditions can simultaneously affect the buckling response of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> beams and put forward their failure...|$|R
50|$|In practice, the {{interlayer}} provides three {{beneficial properties}} to <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> panes: first, the interlayer functions to distribute impact forces across a greater {{area of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> thus increasing the impact resistance of the glass; second, the interlayer functions to bind the resulting shards if the glass is ultimately broken; third the viscoelastic interlayer undergoes plastic deformation during impact and under static loads after impact, absorbing energy and reducing penetration by the impacting object as well as reducing {{the energy of the}} impact that is transmitted to impacting object, e.g. a passenger in a car crash. Thus, the benefits of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> include safety and security. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> also has decorative applications. The interlayer can be colored or patterned.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> is {{also used}} to {{increase}} the sound insulation rating of a window, where it significantly improves sound attenuation compared to unlaminated <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> of the same thickness. For this purpose a special [...] "acoustic PVB" [...] compound is used for the interlayer. In the case of the EVA material, no additional acoustic material is required, since the EVA provides sound insulation. An additional property of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> for windows is that a PVB and EVA interlayer can block essentially most ultraviolet radiation. A thermoset EVA could block up to 99.9% of the UV rays.|$|R
40|$|In modern-day architecture, {{large glass}} facades often define {{the skin of}} prestigious {{buildings}}. When these buildings are considered a target for terroristic attack, great care is required in the structural design as to saveguard human life. Above all, the window components need to be considered, since glass shard debris is {{the main cause of}} injury in any urban impact event. Typically, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are used in blast resistant glazing systems. These consist of 2 glass plies, bonded together by one or more polymer interlayers to retain glass fragments upon fracture. The efficiency of a laminated glass against impact loading depends on a number of factors: ply thicknesses, viscoelastic properties of the interlayer material and bonding strength between layers. The frame connection also plays an important role. Ideally, the window should remain in its frame without glass fragments being propulsed and without tearing of the interlayer. Then the questions are: - How and when does the glass fracture? - How are the fragments kept together by the interlayer? - How much of the impact energy can be dissipated by the window without causing danger to humans? Or practically, up to which load is a glazing panel able to withstand the attack? It may be clear that destructive testing is a complex and expensive manner to assess the applicability of a structural wall configuration. Computer simulation offers a tool that can save time and costs, and the possibility to gain a deeper insight in the quantification of the main failure mechanisms: brittle cracking, delamination, interlayer tearing and frame connection failure. Our aim is to develop a numerical modelling technique for laminated glass under impact and blast loads, validated by laboratory experiments. The finite element model takes into account non-linear material behaviour and allows for localised fracture, using upcoming techniques such as the cohesive zone method...|$|E
40|$|Glass {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} evidence submitted to forensic laboratories for analysis. It is frequently encountered at crime scenes, particularly those involving motor vehicle accidents or burglaries. This study emphasized on the examination of the fracture patterns performed on different types of glass panes after broken by different type of impact objects, analysis of fracture features to determine direction of force and identifying of refractive index of glass as further analysis. Three types of glass panes (float, tempered and laminated) and four levels of breaking devices (hammer, bat, golf ball and stone either by throwing or using catapult) were used in the experiment. The results show that almost the whole float glass panes were shatters into sharp glass pieces after broken by all type of breaking devices. Then, tempered glass pane was broken with the whole glass panes shatters into small pieces of blunt granules when only hammer exerted on the glass, meanwhile, for other breaking devices were caused a scratch marks on glass surface. For laminated glass when broken by bat, throwing a stone and using catapult, almost the whole of glass panes were remains intact on its interlayer film and got some splinters from point of impact were flying out. Meanwhile, fracture patterns on laminated glass pane when broken by hammer produced a cone or crater after striking. However, impact objects used to break those types of glass panes are not really reliable to be distinguished. This is because the fracture patterns on glass panes obviously differ by its types of glass only. When a pane of glass is broken by an impact, majority of the broken fragments will fall in the direction of the force, which is on the side of the glass panes opposite direction of the application of force. A determination of the direction of force in breaking a glass pane can be determined by the direction of the rib marks. As the impact occurs, concentric fractures form around the impact and interconnect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. The edge of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that describe the direction of the blow. The refractive index of each type of glass was determined by GRIM 3 equipment which produce results of refractive index for float glass panes are about 1. 5200; tempered glass panes are about 1. 5181 and, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5188...|$|E
40|$|Luminescent solar {{concentrators}} are devices {{capable of}} converting some spectral components of solar radiation by luminescence and concentrating them before collection by photovoltaic. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to design, develop and demonstrate the principle of all-inorganic semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) structures capable of passing most of the visible light through to provide illumination, while reflecting more than 90 % of the UV and IR radiations and scattering them {{to the edges of}} the glass where they are collected by PV cells to produce electricity. All-inorganic visibly-transparent energy-harvesting clear laminated glass windows are the most practical solution to boosting building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) energy outputs significantly while reducing cooling- and heatingrelated energy consumption in buildings. A typical semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator is based on the integration of micro-engineered optical structures, nano-materials and IR-selective thin-film coatings, to realise stable, long-lifetime and shatterproof clear glass panels. The ability of the proposed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators to generate electricity addresses the future net-zero-energy building demand [1, 2], making them ideal candidates for future high-rise glass buildings. The developed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators employ low-e thin films, which particularly, provide many benefits, including, (i) building overall aesthetic appearance, (ii) low glare and (iii) filtration of unwanted components of the incident sunlight thus increasing the energy saving rating of buildings. The low-e glass panes are typically used in a double glazing structure {{in order to protect the}} low-e film from environmental impacts and improve the insulation properties of the semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators in addition to reducing the energy consumed for cooling or heating the inside of buildings. Multi-layer thin film coatings for solar and thermal radiation control are designed, using the Optilayer software package, developed using Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD), and tested using spectrophotometry. Experimental results show that the measured transmittance spectra for the developed structures are in agreement with simulation results and demonstrate that with the use of optimum metal-dielectric layer combination it is possible to transmit/reflect arbitrary spectral components of the incident sunlight. In addition, two types of semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator structures are designed, developed and characterised, namely: 1. LSCs incorporating inorganic luminophore materials into the lamination interlayer. These luminophores, when used in conjunction with spectrally-selective low-e thin-film coatings and CuInSe 2 solar cells, enable most of the visible solar radiation to be transmitted through the glass window with minimum attenuation and the ultraviolet (UV) radiation to be down-converted and routed together with a significant part of infrared radiation to the edges for collection by solar cells. 2. Advanced LSCs incorporating inorganic luminophore materials as well as spectrallyselective diffraction gratings as light deflector structures of high visible transparency into the lamination interlayer. For these LSCs, most of the visible solar radiation can be transmitted through the glass windows with minimum attenuation while the ultraviolet (UV) and a part of incident solar infrared (IR) radiation energy are converted and/or deflected geometrically for routing towards the vicinity of glass panel edge regions for collection by solar cells. To boost the solar concentration capability of the <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> functionalized epoxy interlayers are especially developed, which comprise UV-curable epoxy and inorganic luminophores with engineered absorption and emission bands. The developed functionalized interlayers demonstrate an excellent ability to scatter and concentrate sunlight within the glass structure with minimum reabsorption. Several materials and combinations of several luminophore types were investigated in order to determine the optimum interlayer structure that exhibits maximum UV and IR radiation scattering, conversion, and deflection towards the edge solar cells. Measured conversion efficiencies of 3. 8 % and 5. 4 % are achieved for 10 cm × 10 cm LSCs samples without and with diffraction gratings, which correspond to output electrical power densities of 38 Wp/m 2 and 54 Wp/m 2,respectively. A photobioreactor based on the developed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator technology is developed, in collaboration with Murdoch University, for microalgae growth. An Insulated Glass Units (IGU) employing a special low-e thin film is developed, which passes more than 50 % of the visible light while blocking more than 90 % of the UV and IR radiations, hence, reducing the temperature inside the photobioreactor and improving the microalgae growth.

The reduced model {{is based on the}} Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Ritz vectors used are determined by simple static load-cases.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{application}} of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> panels in building facades and roofs, tending towards the minimization of frameworks, substructures and supports, technological solutions based {{on the use of}} glass panels with increasingly wide dimensions and modern design principles are becoming more frequent. The growing use of structural glass applications is leading to “lighter” and “smarter” optimized design solutions. The design of such applications greatly depends on the material mechanical properties of their structural elements and on their sensitivity to ambient and loading conditions. This is the specific case of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> where a temperature and time loading sensitive interlayer is generally used to bond together two (or more) <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> with brittle behavior and rather limited tensile resistance. In this research paper, a novel adaptive glass panel concept is developed by using shape-memory alloy (SMA) cables, and assessed by means of Finite-element numerical studies and experimental validation. Based on the case study of an existing <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> roof panel, several geometrical configurations of practical interest are investigated. A key role in the proposed approach is the application of external pre-stressing based on the Joule heating of the SMA bracing system. The structural efficiency of the cable system is emphasized by taking into account the effects of ordinary wind pressures and temperature variations. Due to the innovative adaptive control system, as shown, the structural performance of traditional <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> panels can be enhanced, e. g. optimized in terms of maximum displacements and stresses in the glass, {{as well as in the}} overall dimensions and thicknesses of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{terrorist}} explosions or accidental {{explosions in}} urban areas, {{the greatest threat}} of death and serious injury comes {{from the effects of}} <b>glass</b> fragments. <b>Laminated</b> glazing has been proven by trials and experience of actual events to eliminate the risk of significant fragment injury to people behind the glazing, and also to provide substantial protection from blast injury effects, provided that after cracking it remains as a continuous membrane substantially attached to the supporting frame. However, design of laminated glazing is currently based on extrapolation from testing, with limited understanding of the material behaviour that underlies the behaviour under blast loading. This thesis presents an investigation into the application of a simplified method of dynamic analysis for <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> the development of parameters derived from the properties of the materials in <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> and the behaviour of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> systems that {{can be applied to the}} design of laminated glazing to resist blast loading. The development of the single degree of freedom method for analysis of dynamic response is reviewed from its inception use for analysis of glazing, through its adaptation for reinforced concrete analysis, to its modern use for analysis of glazing. Although the principles of the method are widely applicable, some procedures established for elastic-plastic reinforced concrete analysis in the 1950 s are not appropriate for glazing, and should be treated with care. Coefficients for analysis of reinforced concrete date from approximate analyses in the 1950 s and 60 s and are not accurate. New calculations using advanced yield line models and finite element analysis have been used to provide alternative coefficients for rectangular panels supported on four edges. The elastic analyses for reinforced concrete are linear because they are based on small-deflection theory. Deflections of most uncracked <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> exceed the limits of this theory. The development of practical non-linear large-deflection analyses in the 1980 s was dependent on numerical methods and computer analysis, but they have previously only been applied to resistance and cracking. New non-linear finite element analyses refine the existing resistance data, and data from the same calculations has been used to derive large deflection single degree of freedom parameters for dynamic analysis and to assess the reaction distribution. The cracking of glass arises from small flaws in its surface, and can be very variable in its onset. In addition, the strength is sensitive to the loading rate. Statistical approaches have been based on quasi-static tests, either assuming a normal distribution, or using a more complex Weibull distribution. However, statistical refinement gains little, as strengths then need to be increased for the faster loading under blast. Back-analysis of extensive blast tests had been used to establish deterministic lower bound design cracking strengths for different types of glass. These have been applied in this thesis for design, and back-analysis of blast trials indicates that the design cracking strengths are lower bound. Formulae for a monolithic pane with equivalent behaviour to a <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> are proposed that would allow the large deflection analysis to be applied to <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> up to cracking of the final ply. The results of some blast trials of uncracked <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> are reported which are consistent with an equivalent monolithic analysis. They indicate that <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> under blast can be taken as fully composite to temperatures approaching 20 ºC, but that it is not fully composite at 29 ºC or above. Unfortunately, there is currently no data to indicate the performance in the critical temperature range between. After <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> cracks, the resistance is provided by an interlayer of the viscoelastic polymer, Polyvinyl Butyral. Though research is ongoing, non-linear viscoelastic material models for finite element analyses have not yet been developed to the point that they can reproduce the full range of behaviour observed in the tensile tests over the range of temperatures and elongation rates which are reported in the thesis. Instead, the results of the tensile tests are fitted to a simple bilinear material model by back-analysis of the tensile tests to give three stiffness and strength parameters that vary with temperature and strain rate. Non-linear finite element analyses of PVB membranes corresponding to two series of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> blast trials are used to produce single degree of freedom parameters for membrane response. The blast trials are reported, and back-analysis of the deflection histories is used to estimate the ratio of the PVB material strain rates and the observed <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> strain rates for the best-fit calculated response. This ratio, found to have a mean value of 3. 8, is expected to reflect the stiffening of PVB by attached glass fragments, together with other factors. However, the scatter in the data is large, so the reliability of this figure should be viewed with this in mind. <b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> providing blast protection is normally maintained close to room temperature, so a design based on a room temperature of 23 ºC is proposed, using single degree of freedom data that is a composite of the uncracked data up to cracking and the membrane data after that point. For normal laminated glazing where the observed strain rate is expected to be about 10 /s, design membrane properties based on a PVB strain rate of 40 /s are proposed, but this may need to be modified for other cases. Typical design cases for marginal behaviour are analysed on this basis, and also for material properties at temperatures 6 ºC higher and lower than 23 ºC, to assess the sensitivity of the design to likely temperature variations. These indicate that a margin of 16 - 21 % may be needed on deflection limits to allow for temperature increases, but that the calculated deflections would still be below the maximum deflections observed in the trials without PVB failure. The analyses indicate that the peak reactions are unlikely to be sensitive to temperature. However, they indicate that a margin of safety of 2. 4 will need to be incorporated in the design anchorage strength to resist in-plane tension in the PVB membrane at reduced temperature. The thesis develops an improved design method under blast loading for <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> and double glazing incorporating <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> although some of the values used in the method should be considered tentative. The thesis also indicates a level of anchorage strength sensitivity to temperature reductions that needs to be taken into account in practical glazing designs.

40|$|Because of evident aesthetic, {{lighting}} and architectural advantages, glass curtain walls are largely used to clad modern buildings. Since these elements {{are considered to}} constitute purely architectural systems, they are essentially designed to resist loads acting orthogonally to {{the plane of the}} façade (e. g. wind loads). Contrarily, glass elements are actually largely used as structural elements able to sustain vertical loads (e. g. columns, stiffening fins, beam elements, stairs, etc…), thus to preserve their integrity a buckling verification could assume great im-portance.

Several types of glass are considered: single layered glass as well as <b>laminated</b> and insulated <b>glass</b> units. Typical load cases for strength design of glass are applied. A recently developed finite element is suggested to be suitable for the modeling of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> structures. It is shown that the new finite element is superior to standard solid elements for modeling of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass.</b> The results show that the element provides excellent capabilities for modeling of complex <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> structures with several bolted or adhesive joints. The new element is utilized {{in the development of a}} method to compute stress concentration factors for <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> balustrades with two horizontal rows with two bolt fixings. The stress concentration factors are represented graphically in design charts. The use of the design charts allow the maximum principal stresses of the balustrade to be determined without using finite element analysis or advanced mathematics. The shear-capacity of adhesive glass-joints is tested in a short-term load-case. Commonly used stiff and soft adhesives are considered. Finite element models of the test are developed to determine the material models of the adhesives. The material models are verified through large-scale tests. For the stiff adhesives and the main part of the soft adhesives, the material models are experimentally validated for both small-scale and large-scale tests. For a group of the soft adhesives, further research is necessary to validate the material models for a large-scale joint. A reduced model for determining the maximum principal stresses of a glass subjected to dynamic impact load is developed and validated. The developed model is general in the sense that it is applicable to arbitrary location of the impact as well as to structures of arbitrary boundary condition. The validation is made for a four-sided supported <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> and centric applied impact as well as excentric applied impact. It is shown that the model is applicable to small and medium sized structures. Finally it is proven that the model performs very well for a <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> balustrade of standard dimensions and with clamped fixings. Finally, insulated glass subjected to soft body impact is analyzed be means of structureacoustic analysis. A parametric study is made with respect to in-plane dimensions, glass thickness and thickness of the gas layer. For quadratic <b>panes,</b> a larger <b>glass</b> has a larger center displacement but lower stresses than a smaller glass. A single layered glass is proven to have only marginally greater stresses than the corresponding double glass. The air layer thickness has almost no influence on the stresses of the insulated glass but the thickness of the glass has a large influence. Finally, there is almost nothing to be gained to add a third <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> to the insulated unit...|$|R

40|$|Annealed glass has the {{propensity}} to fast fracture. So, {{the need for}} redundancy in structural glass elements is a fundamental necessity. Currently, redundancy is provided by <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> whereby, if one <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> fails, then the remaining intact pane(s) sustain the loads. However, for the in-service (unbroken state) condition the element is {{at least twice as}} thick as necessary. This leads to increased weight and increased cost. The presented work develops and investigates a cheaper, lighter alternative redundant system using a GFRP sheet bonded to one annealed <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Consequently, a new material, Reinforced Glass, is created. For the in-service (unbroken state) condition it is shown that, under load, the Reinforced Glass has a similar structural response to ordinary annealed glass. A review of annealed structural glass design methods is presented - facilitating design for the unbroken state. Design recommendations are given. For the broken state an analytical, predictive model was developed, which was validated through experimental testing. The model draws similarities to Reinforced Concrete, whereby a compression block is generated in the broken glass - which is balanced by the GFRP tension reinforcement. Unique predictive equations are produced for application in design for the broken state. The model is validated for various thicknesses of glass.

40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>glass</b> {{is for a}} {{few decades}} a {{well-known}} product {{in the construction industry}} for conferring safety performances to glazing units. Besides to the safeguarding of persons, <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> products are contributing to a variety of other safety performances, in case of accidental or attack situations leading to breakage of or crack propagation in the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> of a <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> unit. The ultimate residual load-bearing capacity of a damaged element can be resumed to one critical load-transfer mechanism, in the form of interlayer ligaments bridging the glass fragments. The characterization for design purposes of the mechanical properties of the interlayer involved in this load-transfer mechanism through the ligament appears however far from obvious. This results from specificities on the one hand of adhesive polymer components and on the other of design and control processes in the building industry. These specificities are mainly related to two aspects : firstly to the time- and temperature dependent behaviour of interlayer materials and their possible sensitivity to ageing effects, and secondly to initially vaguely defined intended fields of use, especially when non-conventional structural applications are within the considered application scope. The combination of these two aspects raises constraints for the development of experimental methods, test configurations and assessment strategies for <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> products. This research proposes analysis grids to get an overview of the constitutive elements of application scopes and of the possibilities and limitations for experimental assessment, with purpose to distinguish and estimate different types of border effects. These are used to evaluate the representativeness and the robustness of different test methods and test configurations, corresponding to different experimental scales. An incremental experimental approach has been developed for investigating the time- and temperature dependent performances of damaged <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> elements, on the basis of tests on pre-cracked specimens of small dimensions. The assessment of the residual load-bearing capacity of damaged elements used in structural applications was the main focus of these investigations. This research highlights the need for adapting experimental assessment approaches to characterize properties of <b>laminated</b> <b>glass</b> products for design purposes with respect to their post-fracture performances, in comparison with other construction materials. It also explains specific difficulties for obtaining quantitatively meaningful results and the challenges for harmonizing experimental assessment strategies for different applications and products made with a same type of interlayer material...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{steel is}} a {{material}} {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, slender steel columns usually have a low load bearing resistance due to flexural buckling. It is possible to suppress flexural column buckling by adding <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Thus, use can {{be made of the}} steel section’s squash load reducing the amount of steel involved and obtaining a highly transparent glasssteel column. In this paper, a new type of slender transparent glass-steel column is proposed, consisting of a high strength steel bar supported in lateral direction by <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Its feasibility is shown experimentally and numerically. It is also shown that the design has sufficient redundancy to allow for the loss of supporting <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> without a reduction of the load bearing capacity. The key design feature of this glass-steel column is the way the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are connected to the steel bar, namely by sliding steel sleeves to avoid direct stresses to occur in the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> due to axial column deformation...|$|R
40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{the use of}} <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> as transparent stability elements in vertical façade structures subjected to in-plane loads including temperature loads. In the present façade architecture, glass is normally used non-structural. The only mechanical requirement is to resist transversal loads, which determines {{the thickness of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Thus, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are not used to stabilize the structural system. However, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> have excellent in-plane stiffness qualities, and providing appropriate connections between glass and the supporting structure, this in-plane stiffness can possibly attribute to the building’s stability. Temperature loads on the glass avoid making a totally stiff connection between glass and structure, whereas this would be required for the stability aspect. To investigate this problem, this paper presents two conceptual connection designs between glass and structure. For temperature loads, these connections will be studied using the theory of plates. It is shown that a bond line as connection, having a large stiffness directly leads to a uniformly distribution equal to almost the complete temperature load. If the shear stiffness of the bond line is taken into account, a complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> occurs, even for a geometrical and physical linear approach. Thus, the impact of the temperature loads is significant for all <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> (plate level) and is independent on façade size and this in contrast with the collaboration of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> and supporting structure to resist laterally mechanical loads (structure level). Research will continue with experiments to verify the theoretical derived results and with the development of finite element models to study the complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane,</b> dependent on connection type and load case...|$|R
40|$|Circumferentially {{adhesive}} bonded <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> in steel frames of facades {{can take over}} the structural function of steel braces for the stabilization of one-storey buildings. A system, built up of a steel frame, a single <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> and a flexible {{adhesive bonded}} joint across the full thickness of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> was subjected to a concentrated horizontal in-plane load at the top. Experiments with square <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal in-plane loads and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the adhesive bonded joint. At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> sizes have two glass-steel contacts. The mechanic models well predict the in-plane stiffness of the system, the largest maximum principle stress and the maximum normal and shear stresses in the adhesive bonded joint. The horizontal in-plane load and the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top at the first glass-steel contact are also well predicted. The criteria are the limitation of the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top (serviceability) or the strain rate of the adhesive bonded joint (strength). To guarantee the stability of a building all <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> in the facade have to be mobilized to transfer in-plane load...|$|R
