This was demonstrated by public meetings held to support {{the building of the}} bridge and the participation of local authorities in its building. It was completed at a time when funds for local authorities were scarce because of priority given by the government to developmental railways.

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran congratulated Pakistan where the major celebration took place. All new U.S. economic assistance to Pakistan was suspended in May 1998 though the humanitarian aid continued.

5000|$|By March 1968, {{spiralling}} {{debts and}} the [...] "Brentford Borough" [...] saga threatened the club's existence {{for the second}} time in a year. With £70,000 of the £135,000 debt needed to be paid in June 1968, former director Walter Wheatley stepped in and provided the club with a £69,000 interest-fee <b>loan,</b> <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> 12 months. On the pitch, the team had experienced something of a revival, winning five matches and drawing two of a 9-match spell between late February and early April, but the retirement of George Thomson and the departure of Eddie Reeve left manager Jimmy Sirrel with just 14 players with which to complete the season. Brentford finished in 14th place, having used just 18 outfield players during the course of the season.|$|R

The name [...] "Brentford Borough FC" [...] had already been chosen for the new Hillingdon-based club, but once again Brentford was saved at the eleventh hour, with former director Walter Wheatley granting the club a £69,000 interest-free <b>loan,</b> <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> 12 months.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Pakistan {{received}} about $2.5 {{billion per year}} in loan/grant assistance from international financial institutions (e.g., the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank) and bilateral donors. Increasingly, the composition of assistance to Pakistan shifted away from grants toward <b>loans</b> <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> foreign exchange. All new U.S. economic assistance to Pakistan was suspended after October 1990, and additional sanctions were imposed after Pakistan's May 1998 nuclear weapons tests. The sanctions were lifted by president George W. Bush after Pakistani president Musharraf allied Pakistan with the U.S. in its war on terror. Having improved its finances, the government refused further IMF assistance, and consequently the IMF programme was ended. The government is also reducing tariff barriers with bilateral and multilateral agreements. The government is also reducing tariff barriers with bilateral and multilateral agreements.|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{connection}} between money, banks, and aggregate credit. We start with a simple “real ” model without money, where banks make <b>loans</b> <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> goods and depositors hold claims on the bank payable on demand in goods. Aggregate production may be delayed in the economy. If so, we show {{that the level of}} ongoing bank lending, and hence of aggregate future output, can decrease with increases in the real repayment due on deposits: ceteris paribus, the higher the amount due, the more likely there will be insufficient goods, given the delay, to pay depositors, and the more new lending has to be curtailed to make up the shortfall. Thus a temporary delay in production can be exacerbated by banks into a more permanent reduction of total output. A number of inefficiencies including bank failures can result if deposits turn out to be too high. We then introduce money in this model. We show that if demand deposits are <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> money rather than in goods, banks can be hedged against production delays: under certain circumstances, the price level will rise with delays in production, reducing the real value of the deposits banks have to pay out. But demand deposits payable in money can expose the banks to new risks: the value of money can fluctuate for reasons other than delays in aggregat...|$|R

5000|$|For the {{construction}} of the railroad on Georgian territory, Azerbaijan is providing a US$200 million <b>loan</b> to Georgia, <b>repayable</b> <b>in</b> 25 years, with an annual interest rate of 1%.

[...] As of September 2007, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan has allocated the first US$50 million installment of this loan. The European Union and the United States declined to assist in the financing or promoting of the line because they saw it as designed to bypass Armenia, supporting instead the reopening of the Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railroad, thanks in part to pressure on the US Congress from Armenian lobbies in Washington like ARMENPAC or the Armenia National Committee in America.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present evaluation was to conduct a needs assessment of the Ottawa-Carleton community for the proposed implementation of a rent bank service by the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre. The purpose of a rent bank would be to provide individuals {{in danger of losing}} their housing due to owing rent arrears with financial assistance {{in the form of a}} <b>repayable</b> <b>loan.</b> Notably, <b>in</b> June 1999 the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre established a rent bank project on a pilot basis, pending the results of this needs assessment. The study used a multi-informant, multi-method approach for assessing needs, which included reviewing secondary data, conducting focus groups with community stakeholders, interviewing key informants, and reviewing available client information from the rent bank pilot service established in June, 1999 at the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre. A review of existing rent bank projects in Canada and the United States showed that irrespective of resources and target population, their goal is to prevent eviction, and therefore homelessness. Similarly, data indicated that key informants viewed the primary goal of a rent bank in Ottawa-Carleton as preventing eviction due to owing rent arrears. In contrast, focus group members saw the necessity for a more general goal for a rent bank (e. g., arrears in utilities, las...|$|R

50|$|From about 1985, {{like many}} other banks, Takugin opened {{branches}} in Tokyo and Osaka, and became concerned with real estate. In ordinary banking activity,finance is not provided above the 70% of real estate value, {{but at the time}} of the bubble it was foreseen that land values would rise steeply, so real estate financing was offered at 120-130% of value. Many credit facilities at this time were taking a similar form of finance, but Takugin had been somewhat slow off the mark. It therefore had to set collateral at a lower precedence than the collateral which had been already given to other credit providers. This meant that the part of the <b>loan</b> <b>repayable</b> to Takugin would be less if the borrowing real estate company were to go bankrupt. Ultimately, this is exactly what was to happen.|$|R
