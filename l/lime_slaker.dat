40|$|Single-rate and multirate sampled-data (SD) {{systems as}} well as linear time {{periodic}} (LTP) systems with discrete jumps are analyzed in the frequency domain. The focus of the analysis is both on rejection of disturbances and on robust stability properties. Due to the periodic behavior of LTP systems, a distinction is made between the performance frequency gain (PFG) and the robust frequency gain (RFG). The maximum power gain is computed for two different sets of input signals. In {{the analysis of the}} PFG a single sinusoidal signal v 0 e j w t is considered, while for the analysis of the RFG v 0 (t) e j w t is used as input, where v 0 (t) is a periodically time-varying complex vector. The RFG is related to current frequency response approaches for SD systems. In a parallel work, a semi-physical model is developed for an industrial dry lime slaking process. The model is based on mass and heat balances for two non-stationary ideal stirred tank reactors in series. It is shown how the total reaction rate is derived from the conversion rate for lime particles. The identification of the conversion rate is based on a number of batch experiments, where the temperature and water evaporation flow from the batch is continuously monitored. Experiments have also been performed on a pilot plant slaker. It is verified that the slaker can be modeled as two ideal tank reactors in series. The evaporation model is based on experimental data from the pilot plant slaker. The slaker model is simulated and compared to a step response experiment. An H ¥ -controller is designed for the <b>lime</b> <b>slaker</b> model using both continuous and discrete measurements. The design includes both H ¥ -synthesis and frequency analysis of the closed-loop system. An algorithm for the periodic solution of the Riccati differential equation with jumps, associated with the filtering update, is presented. A problem in LTP design is that the closed-loop system may never reach steady state when it is subjected to step disturbances. Instead the closed-loop system reaches a periodic steady state where the output oscillates. It is shown how weighting filters in the control design can be selected to avoid the oscillation problem...|$|E
40|$|The Miami-Dade 3, 000 tpd Refused-Derived Fuel (RDF) {{facility}} {{is located in}} Miami Dade County, FL and is operated by Montenay Power, a Veolia Environmental Services Company. A team composed of plant staff and outside experts underwent a thorough equipment-by-equipment review of the Air Pollution Control (APC) system and identified a series of low cost design and operational improvements to the <b>lime</b> <b>slakers,</b> the spray dryers and the baghouses. These improvements were implemented {{over the course of}} several months and resulted in a drop in lime consumption, in the economy of one and a half air compressor units, and in reduced APC related plant downtime and maintenance costs. This paper describes several key improvement projects (including the upgrade of the spray nozzles, the change in slaking water quality and the fly ash fluidization project), detailing the initial problem, the chosen solution, the difficulties encountered during implementation and the achieved benefits...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{installation}} of a completely automated powdered lime plant during 1994 is described. This {{marked the beginning of}} a major expansion at Maidstone Mill. The conversion from rock <b>lime,</b> a rotary <b>slaker</b> and full time lime plant attendant to a completely automated plant producing milk of lime from powdered or ground unslaked lime was a first within Tongaat-Hulett Sugar. The advantages in lime handling, transport, process control, productivity and safety vastly outweigh the disadvantage of the additional cost of powdered lime. The installation costs are relatively high, however the operating costs show a nett saving in excess of R 50 000 per annum. As a process operation, the new plant has proved a great success...|$|R
