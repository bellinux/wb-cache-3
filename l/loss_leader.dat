5|$|The Kansas City Royals {{were added}} to the American League in a 1969 {{expansion}} after the city's first Major League Baseball franchise departed for Oakland, California. Joe Gordon, one of two Hall of Famers to manage the Royals, was selected as the team's first manager, leading the team for one season. Bob Lemon, who took over during the 1970 season, is the second member of the Hall of Fame to lead the team, and managed until the end of 1972. Whitey Herzog is the franchise leader in regular-season wins (410) and winning percentage (.574), and Tony Muser is the <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> (431). Dick Howser is the leader in postseason wins and losses (8–12). Trey Hillman led the Royals for parts of three seasons after a five-year managerial career in Japan, but was fired May 13, 2010, and replaced by current manager Ned Yost.|$|E
5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b> The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E
25|$|Concorde service {{proved a}} <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> for Braniff. Braniff charged only a 10 percent premium over {{standard}} first-class fare {{to fly the}} Concorde – and later removed the surcharge altogether – but the 100-seat plane often flew {{with no more than}} 15 passengers. Meanwhile, Boeing 727s scheduled 5–10 minutes slower on the same route were filled routinely.|$|E

50|$|Similar to Bait pricing, {{retailers}} use leader pricing {{to entice}} customers {{to come into}} the stores by advertising items, the <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> at a low price. When they arrive at the stores aiming for the promoting products, they often end up buying extra products at their full prices. Therefore, businesses earn their profit off of the unplanned buying decisions by customers besides the <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> (Lazear, 1995).|$|R
25|$|Huntington's {{involvement}} with urban rail was intimately tied to his {{real estate development}} operations. Real estate development was so lucrative for Huntington and SP that they could use the Red Car as a <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b> However, by 1920, {{when most of the}} company's holdings had been developed, their major income source began to deplete. Many rural passenger lines were unprofitable, with losses offset by revenue generated from passenger lines in populated corridors and from freight operations. The least-used Red Car lines were converted to cheaper bus routes as early as 1925.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Harry Potters British publisher, Bloomsbury, and Asda, a British {{supermarket}} chain {{owned by the}} US corporation Wal-Mart. On 15 July, {{a week before the}} release of the final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was [...] "holding children to ransom" [...] and that, [...] "t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a quid-ditch as they have sent their prices up north on the Hogwarts Express. By setting the recommended retail price at this level can only be seen [...] as blatant profiteering on their part." [...] Pritchard {{went on to say that}} Asda was acting to [...] "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was [...] "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller". Asda had planned to sell the book as a <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's recommended retail price of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).|$|E
500|$|Asda, {{along with}} several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily {{discounted}} price, sparked a price war {{two days before the}} book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b> This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, [...] "It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans." [...] Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: [...] "You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|A <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> is {{a product}} that has a price set below the {{operating}} margin. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and [...] budget-priced retail outlets where {{it is intended to}} generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.|$|E
2500|$|However, General Motors and Ford Motor Company {{were locked}} in a battle for market {{supremacy}} that started in 1945 when Ford's new president, Henry Ford II, had a burning desire to make his company number one again. By 1953, all of the independent automobile manufacturers were also feeling the after effects of Henry Ford’s plan to dump {{tens of thousands of}} vehicles into the market at discounted prices to try and wrestle the top automotive manufacturing title from GM. General Motors responded by doing the same. With the market flooded by inexpensive cars, Studebaker, Packard, Willys, Hudson, Kaiser Motors, and Nash were all unable to sell their vehicles at <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> prices to keep up with Ford and GM. The [...] "frantic 1953–54 Ford/GM price war" [...] devastated the remaining [...] "independent" [...] automakers.|$|E

40|$|Internationally, {{the prices}} of retail {{products}} have been seen to drop during periods of exogenous increases in demand. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the generality of this stylized fact by investigating whether this behavior also takes place in Chile, through the monthly prices of a set of retail products with positive demand seasonality. The prices of some products show a drop during their peak idiosyncratic demand.

40|$|I {{evaluate}} German {{regulation that}} requires retail discounters {{to guarantee the}} availability of their products in bargain sales. The regulation is meant to prevent <b>loss</b> <b>leaders.</b> Retailers however claim that rationing is due to demand uncertainty and thereby undermine the regulation's rationale. Indeed, demand uncertainty explains empirical observations better than a theory of <b>loss</b> <b>leaders.</b> This paper shows, however, that also under demand uncertainty the regulation has positive effects. Ultimately, it raises production, which, under imperfect competition, is beneficial. A strict regulation overshoots its goal when high demand is relatively unlikely. In this case more sophisticated regulation is required. ...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> or {{leader is}} a product sold at a low price (i.e. at cost or below cost) to stimulate other {{profitable}} sales. This would help the companies to expand its market share as a whole. <b>Loss</b> <b>leader</b> strategy is commonly used by retailers in order to lead the customers into buying products with higher marked-up prices to produce an increase in profits rather than purchasing the leader product which is sold at a lower cost. When a [...] "featured brand" [...] is priced to be sold at a lower cost, retailers tend not to sell large quantities of the <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> products and also they tend to purchase less quantities from the supplier as well to prevent loss for the firm. Supermarkets and restaurants are {{an excellent example of}} retail firms that apply the strategy of <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{use of a}} <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> is to draw {{customers}} into a {{store where}} {{they are likely to}} buy other goods.

5000|$|Some <b>loss</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{rather than}} being advertised as bargains, are {{high-end}} products offered below profit margin to enhance the company's prestige and/or to attract [...] "lookers" [...] who may buy other less expensive but more profitable merchandise.|$|R

40|$|Dispersion {{in retail}} prices of {{identical}} goods {{is inconsistent with}} the standard model of price competition among identical firms, which predicts that all prices will be driven down to cost. One common explanation for such dispersion {{is the use of}} a loss-leader strategy, in which a firm prices one good below cost in order to attract a higher customer volume for profitable goods. By assuming each consumer is forced to buy all desired goods at a single firm, we create the possibility of an effective loss-leader strategy. We find that such a strategy cannot occur in equilibrium if individual demands are inelastic, or if demands are diversely distributed. We further show that equilibrium <b>loss</b> <b>leaders</b> can occur (and can result in positive profits) if there are demand complementarities, but only with delicate relationships among the preferences of all consumers.
