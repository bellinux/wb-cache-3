50|$|This {{species is}} found in {{freshwater}} lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers with mud bottoms. Radix auricularia can live on boulders or vegetation in low or high-flow environments, and is capable of tolerating anoxic conditions, but it tends to prefer very <b>lentic</b> <b>waters</b> in lakes, bogs or slow rivers {{where there is a}} silt substrate.|$|R

50|$|Andreone et al. {{suggest that}} the {{reproductive}} mode of B. angolafa is a derived character, having evolved from the more typical reproduction in <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies. The general scarcity of lentic habitats in Malagasy rain forests may have provided the conditions that favoured the evolution of this phytotelmic breeding strategy.|$|E
50|$|Perennial {{standing}} (<b>lentic)</b> <b>water</b> {{is usually}} called a lake or a pond, {{but there are}} several local or dialect English words for such features.

25|$|Lake {{ecosystems}} are {{a prime example}} of lentic ecosystems. Lentic refers to stationary or relatively still water, from the Latin lentus, which means sluggish. <b>Lentic</b> <b>waters</b> range from ponds to lakes to wetlands, and much of this article applies to lentic ecosystems in general. Lentic ecosystems can be compared with lotic ecosystems, which involve flowing terrestrial waters such as rivers and streams.

50|$|This species prefers {{freshwater}} lakes with soft, muddy or silty bottoms, reservoirs, slow-moving freshwater rivers, streams, paddy fields, {{and ponds}} with aquatic grass, creeping {{at the bottom}} of the water or on aquatic grasses.

It can tolerate conditions in stagnant waters near septic tanks.|$|E
5000|$|The tadpoles {{hatch and}} {{feed on the}} trophic eggs; they can remain in the nest for up to 25 days, growing in size. At {{the start of the}} rainy season, the tadpoles move to <b>lentic</b> <b>water,</b> where they will {{complete}} their metamorphosis, feeding on anuran eggs, other tadpoles, and carrion. [...] Other frog species do not lay their eggs until the first heavy rains; the head-start of the L. labyrinthicus tadpoles allows them {{to take advantage of the}} eggs and newly hatched tadpoles of other frog species. L. labyrinthicus tadpoles are mostly active at night, and hide from visual predators (including birds such as the creamy-bellied thrush) during the day by burrowing in gravel and leaves.|$|E
5000|$|After {{several years}} of good monsoons and a good crop in the early 1970s, India {{considered}} exporting food and being self-sufficient. Earlier in 1963, {{the government of the}} state of Maharashtra asserted that the agricultural situation in the state was constantly being watched and relief measures were taken as soon as any scarcity was detected. On the basis of this, and asserting that the word famine had now become obsolete in this context, the government passed [...] "The Maharashtra Deletion of the Term 'Famine' Act, 1963". They were unable to foresee the drought in 1972 when 25 million people needed help. The relief measures undertaken by the Government of Maharashtra included employment, programmes aimed at creating productive assets such as tree plantation, conservation of soil, excavation of canals, and building artificial <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies. The public distribution system distributed food through fair-price shops. No deaths from starvation were reported.|$|E

50|$|The {{best known}} {{examples}} for long term air retention under water are the floating ferns of genus Salvinia. About ten species of very diverse sizes {{are found in}} <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> in all warmer regions of the earth, one widely spread species (S. natans) found in temperate climates can be even found in Central Europe. The ability to retain air is presumably a survival technique for these plants. The upper side of the floating leaves is highly water repellent and possesses highly complex and species-specific very distinctive hairs. Some species present multicellular free-standing hairs of 0.3-3 mm length (e. g. S. cucullata) while on others, two hairs are connected at the tips (e. g. S. oblongifolia). S. minima and S. natans have four free standing hairs connected at a single base. The Giant Salvinia (S. molesta), as well as S. auriculata, and other closely related species, display the most complex hairs: four hairs grow on a shared shaft; they are connected at their tips. These structures resemble microscopic eggbeaters and are therefore referred to as “eggbeater trichomes”. The entire leaf surface, including the hairs, is covered with nanoscale wax crystals which are {{the reason for the}} water repellent properties of the surfaces. These leaf surfaces are therefore a classical example of a “hierarchical structuring“.|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in Bagmati river (Lotic water body), Taudah lake, Nag pokhari pond, Siddha pokhari pond and Godavari fish pond (<b>Lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies) of the Kathmandu valley from May 2000 to April 2002. A monthly samples of water and zooplanktons were collected from those sites and analyzed for the entire twenty four months period. Only three groups of zooplankton viz: Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda were collected from the lotic and <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies. It was observed that Rotifers were found to be more diversified than Cladocerans and Copepods in all water bodies except in Nagpokhari. A total of seventy one species of zooplankton were recorded during that period. The <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies sup-ported a higher species richness constituting seventy species whereas the lotic water bod-ies constituted only seven species of zooplankton. All investigated zooplanktons Rotifera, Cladodera and Copepoda were found contagiously distributed in all <b>lentic</b> <b>water</b> bodies. In the Bagmati river, Rotifers were recorded only in the upstream zone. Cladocerans predomi-nated (74 z%) in the upstream, Copepods predominated (70 %) in the mid-stream and again Cladocerans predominated (60 %) in the down-stream of the river. Among the investigated water bodies, the species richness was found higher in Godavari fish pond (36 species) than Taudah lake (35 species), Siddha pokhari (34 species) and Nag pokhari (26 species). The water quality of the investigated waterbodies were found to be deteriorated due to discharge of untreated effluents,solid wastes and poor conservation practices...|$|E

The number of taxa was considered high when compared to similar studies. Among the richest group, rotifers, the most expressed genera were Lecane and Brachionus.
