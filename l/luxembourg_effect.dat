40|$|This article uses patent boxes, which reduce {{taxes on}} income from patents and other IP assets, to {{illustrate}} {{the fact that the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice has a longer reach than has previously been recognized. This article argues that, along with having effects within the European Union, the ECJ’s decisions can also have effects on countries outside of the EU. In the direct tax context, the ECJ’s jurisprudence has hampered the ability of both EU and non-EU countries to police international tax avoidance. In 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposed restrictions on patent boxes that were designed to limit income-shifting opportunities. As this article points out, these restrictions are weaker than they could have been due to EU legal constraints. Although the majority of countries involved in the OECD’s work on patent boxes were not EU Member States, they were all constrained by the ECJ’s permissive definition of tax avoidance. This article argues that the tax jurisprudence of the ECJ placed downward pressure on international tax avoidance standards and that this in turn shows that countries both within and without the European Union are losing the ability to prevent international tax avoidance to the degree that would have been possible {{in the absence of the}} ECJ’s tax jurisprudence. This article refers to this downward pressure as the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>effect.</b> This effect is even more important in the context of the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union since it highlights that a vote to be free of EU law may not have the desired effect if even non-EU countries are subject to the consequences of the ECJ’s jurisprudence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Powerful {{radio waves}} can heat an {{electron}} gas via collisions between free electrons and neutral particles. Since {{the discovery of}} the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>effect</b> in 1934, this effect is known to take place in the D-region ionosphere. According to theoretical models, the EISCAT Heating facility is capable of increasing the electron temperature by a factor of 5 – 10 in the D region, depending mostly on the electron density profile. Various indirect evidence for the existence of the D-region heating effect has been available, including successful modification of ionospheric conductivities and mesospheric chemistry. However, an experimental quantification of the electron temperature at its maximum in the heated D-region ionosphere has been missing. In particular, incoherent scatter (IS) radars should be able to observe directly plasma parameters, such as the electron temperature, although the heated D-region ionosphere is not a trivial target because of low electron density, and hence, small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this thesis, Papers I and III present unique estimates for heated D-region electron temperatures based on IS measurements. It turned out that the theoretical predictions of the electron temperature generally agree with the few existing observations, at least at the altitudes of the maximum heating effect. Quite in contrast, when the D-region heating effect on the cosmic radio noise absorption was verified for the first time by the statistical data analysis presented in Paper II, the absorption enhancements due to heating were found to be an order of magnitude smaller than model results. The reason for this discrepancy remains still as open question, although one possible explanation is provided by the electron-temperature dependent ion chemistry, which was not taken into account in the modelling. The significance of the heating-induced ion chemistry effect in the D-region was investigated in Paper IV. There the heating-induced negative ion formation is proposed as a potential explanation for the observed modulation of Polar Mesosphere Winter Echo (PMWE) power...|$|E
50|$|Another sudden spike {{of success}} {{came at the}} end of the 1980s. Luxembourg won three National Division titles {{back-to-back}} between 1990 and 1992 and returned to the habit of European qualification. Nonetheless, as with so many clubs in Luxembourg during the 1990s and 2000s, Union could not withstand the pressure to consolidate. Union arranged a merger with CA Spora Luxembourg and CS Alliance 01 to form its modern form, Racing FC Union <b>Luxembourg,</b> to take <b>effect</b> after the 2004-05 season. As it happens, Union was relegated in 2004-05 (as was Spora), marking an unfitting end to one of Luxembourg's most successful clubs.|$|R

The seminar explains the proposed FTT and its mechanisms and analyze whether the FTT’s policy goals can actually be achieved through the proposed directive. It explores the differences between the French FTT and the Commission’s proposal and present some initial experiences with the FTT. The seminar also reflects on the <b>effects</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> financial institutions and funds can expect to endure if an FTT is introduced in Luxembourg, as well as provide a brief look into the potential consequences Luxembourg may face if surrounded by countries implementing an FTT...|$|R
40|$|While {{the value}} of ‘schematic representations’ in problem solving {{requires}} no further demonstration, {{the way in which}} students should be taught how to construct these representations invariably gives rise to various debates. This study, conducted on 146 grade 4 students in <b>Luxembourg,</b> analyzes the <b>effect</b> of two types of ‘schematic representation’ (diagrams vs. schematic drawings) on the solving of arithmetical problems. The results show that the presence of schematic representations has a clear positive effect on overall student performance and that a non negligible proportion of students manage to reuse the representations encountered in order to solve new problems. While showing an effect slightly in favor of diagrams as opposed to schematic drawings, our results do not really permit us to draw any conclusions about the form that these representations should take, in particular since a differential effect was observed {{depending on the type of}} problem.

40|$|Using {{a case of}} Luxembourg a {{cross-cultural}} comparative {{perspective is}} linked to between as well as within country comparisons by answering a two-folded question. First we analyzed the level of measurement equivalence, i. e. {{the extent to which}} ethnic groups in Luxembourg and citizen of their countries of origin assign the same meaning to attitude questions. Secondly, we examined whether ethnic-cultural groups within Luxembourg resemble citizens from their native country more than Luxembourger?s attitudes, i. e. we compared the relative influence of a given national context and cultural background of Luxembourg?s minorities on their attitudes. We selected three scales from the EVS 2009 to demonstrate different types of result from such analyses. As expected, it turned out that cultural background is more important than national context {{in the case of the}} Portuguese minority that is culturally more distant to the Luxembourg?s native population, and that national setting is prevailing factor in the cases of German and French minorities that are well integrated in the <b>Luxembourg</b> society. The <b>effect</b> of a common national setting is also important with regards to the issue of measurement equivalence, where it contributes to greater comparability of intra-national, cross-ethnic comparisons. cross-cultural research; measurement equivalence; attitudes; latent class factor analysis; European Value Study...|$|R
40|$|Luxembourg {{was able}} to develop, enlarge and improve its corporatist welfare system with Scandinavian standards, {{creating}} one of, if not the most substantial regime in the EU/OECD. Several aspects are outstanding: expansion and improvement took place {{over the last two}} decades; important reserves for the pension insurance allowed replacement rates being on top within OECD countries; corporatist elements had been reduced in favour of a higher impact of the State; defamilzation took place, thus a significant recalibration. There is no experience of cutbacks or significant cost containment measures leading to losses and a higher responsibility for the insured. The question is, how did Luxembourg manage to increase and improve its welfare offer, while other developed countries have had to cutback since the 1970 s? And what was the impact of the financial crisis on welfare policies up to the end of 2009. Luxembourg has the most regulated labour market within OECD, but also the most diversified in terms of migration and cross border movements. Two factors are commonly considered putting welfare systems under pressure: globalisation and ageing <b>effects.</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> avoided the last one via its permanently rejuvenating immigration and cross border movement: age- and family-member-dependency ratios are extremely low for cross border commuters compared to those of residents. The extremely transnationalised labour force might be considered as an implicit ?globalising? answer. This small nation-state used its sovereignty taking advantage of the imbrication of national and transnational (EU) law: crossers contribute fully, but are not fully entitled to benefits. Immigration is sometimes considered to be a threat to the sustainability of welfare schemes; in Luxembourg however immigrants and crossers were the main factors for expansion.
