GENERALIZED LOGISTIC FUNCTION Graphs of the TSE and NSE data have apparent asymptotes which are different from the x axis. These are called generalised <b>logistic</b> <b>curves.</b> These curves are expressed by the following equation, The common logistic equation is: k y = c + 1 + me k y 1 = 1 + me − ax (3. 1) −ax (3. 2) These equations are very simple, but both are non linear. Many teachers can easily handle y 1 type curves, but the (3. 1) type curve is a little different and is rarely treated in stochastic packages. We will determine the four parameters c, m, a and k of (3. 1) for TSE and NSE. Since (3. 1) is non linear we will first try to linearise this equation.

50|$|An {{important}} model {{related to}} carrying capacity (K), is the <b>logistic</b> growth <b>curve.</b> The <b>logistic</b> growth <b>curve</b> depicts {{a more realistic}} version of how population growth rate, available resources, and the carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the <b>logistic</b> growth <b>curve</b> model, when the population size is small {{and there are many}} resources available, population over-time increases and so does the growth rate. However, as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited, the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that carrying capacity does not change. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it. For instance, an increase in the population growth can lead to over-exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neuroprotective {{effects of}} esmolol in {{laboratory}} and clinical settings have been reported. The {{present study was}} designed to quantitatively evaluate the neuroprotective effects of esmolol using <b>logistic</b> regression <b>curves</b> and extracellular potentials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 42 gerbils, bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries was performed for 3, 5, or 7 minutes (n= 7 in each group). In treated animals, esmolol (200 µg/kg/min) was administered for 90 minutes, 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. Direct current potentials were measured in the bilateral CA 1 regions, in which histologic evaluation was performed 5 days later. Relations of neuronal damage with ischemic duration and duration of ischemic depolarization were determined using <b>logistic</b> regression <b>curves.</b> RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference in}} onset time between the 2 groups (the control group vs. the esmolol group: 1. 65 ± 0. 46 vs. 1. 68 ± 0. 45 min, P= 0. 76), and significant differences in durations of ischemic depolarization were not observed with any ischemic duration. However, <b>logistic</b> regression <b>curves</b> indicated that esmolol has a neuroprotective effect from 2. 95 to 7. 66 minutes of ischemic depolarization (P< 0. 05), and esmolol prolonged the duration of ischemic depolarization causing 50 % neuronal damage from 4. 97 to 6. 34 minutes (P< 0. 05). <b>Logistic</b> regression <b>curves</b> also indicated that esmolol has a neuroprotective effect from 3. 77 to 7. 74 minutes of ischemic duration (P< 0. 05), and esmolol prolonged the ischemic duration causing 50 % neuronal damage from 4. 26 to 4. 91 minutes (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
