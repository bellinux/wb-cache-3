5000|$|During remarks at a 2003 gathering, John Young {{stated that}} a {{protruding}} tile gap filler ducted hot gas {{into the right}} main landing gear well, which caused significant damage, including the buckling of the landing gear door. He said that neither he nor Crippen were told about this incident {{and he was not}} aware that it had happened until reading the postflight mission report for STS-1, also adding that the gas leak was noted in the report, but not the buckling of the <b>landing</b> <b>door.</b> (The buckling of the door is in fact in the anomaly report, anomaly STS-1-V-49.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} seals for {{the main}} <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> of the Shuttle Orbiters were raised by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board as a potential safety concern. Inspections of seals installed on the Shuttle Discovery revealed that they were permanently deformed and no longer met certified seal compression requirements. Replacement of the seals led to the inability to fully close the main <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors.</b> Johnson Space Center requested that Glenn Research Center conduct tests on the main <b>landing</b> gear <b>door</b> environmental seals to assist in installing the seals in a manner to allow the main <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> to fully close. Further testing was conducted {{to fill out the}} seal performance database. Results from the testing indicated that the method of bonding the seals was important in reducing seal loads on the main <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors.</b> Also, the replacement seals installed in Shuttle Discovery were found to have leakage performance sufficient to meet the certification requirements...|$|R

5000|$|Swearingen Aircraft {{was founded}} by Ed Swearingen in 1959. Early work by the company {{included}} the development of prototype aircraft for other manufacturers; such as the Twin Comanche prototype developed for Piper Aircraft during 1962 {{and the development of}} several research helicopters for the Bell Helicopter Company, work which led to the HueyCobra. The company also developed modifications of other designs, an activity Ed Swearingen had been involved in prior to his forming Swearingen Aircraft. These modification programs included the Excalibur 800 conversion of the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, (because the combined output of its two Lycoming IO-720 engines was 800 horsepower); airframe improvements included modifying the cabin to allow entry via an airstair instead of over the RH wing to a <b>door,</b> and <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> that fully enclosed the wheels when retracted. The airstair was factory-fitted by Beechcraft during manufacture of the ultimate J50 model of the Twin Bonanza. The Queen Air development of the Twin Bonanza also received the Swearingen treatment, the Queen Air Excalibur having less extensive modifications, also involving fitting of [...] IO-720s, replacing the more troublesome and lower-power geared Lycoming engines installed at manufacture, and the enclosed <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> (the Queen Air was designed from the outset with an airstair). The United States Army had several of its U-8 versions of the Queen Air modified to this standard. Excalibur aircraft are easily distinguishable from standard Twin Bonanzas and Queen Airs by the <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> and the more rectangular engine cowlings of the Excaliburs compared to the rounded cowlings of the originals.|$|R
25|$|During {{the time}} the F-102A was in service, several new wing designs were used to {{experiment}} with the application of increased conical camber to the wings. Ultimately, a design was selected that actually increased elevon area, reduced takeoff speed, improved the supersonic L/D ratio and increased the aircraft's ceiling to 56,000ft (17,069m). A modification was required to the <b>landing</b> gear <b>doors</b> due to the wing redesign.|$|R
