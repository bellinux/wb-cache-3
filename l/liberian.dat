5|$|The LFF {{was renamed}} as the Armed Forces of Liberia under the Amended National Defense Law of 1956, though other sources say 1962, {{which appears to}} have been the date the land force became the <b>Liberian</b> National Guard. From this period, Liberia's armed forces {{consisted}} of the <b>Liberian</b> National Guard, the <b>Liberian</b> Militia, whose ostensible structure is depicted below, and the <b>Liberian</b> Coast Guard. Until 1980, by law every able-bodied male between the ages of 16 and 45 years was to serve in the militia, though this stipulation was not enforced.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960s, Liberia {{dispatched}} troops, including a movement control unit, to support ONUC during the Congo Crisis, and were airlifted into the Congo by the United States Air Force. The <b>Liberian</b> troops were initially in Équateur province. In 1961, during their first combat action in country, 300 <b>Liberian</b> troops repelled an attack by 5,000 Baluba tribesmen and their European officers.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} Cold War, the AFL {{saw little}} action, apart from a {{reinforced}} company group which was sent to ONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1960s. This changed {{with the advent of}} the First <b>Liberian</b> Civil War in 1989. The AFL became entangled in the conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 1996–97, and then the Second <b>Liberian</b> Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Liberian</b> open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the <b>Liberian</b> government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The <b>Liberian</b> registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, the AFL {{consists}} of two infantry battalions, a Service Support Company a Military Police Company, the Logistics Command, and the <b>Liberian</b> National Coast Guard. For several years after the war, a Nigerian Army officer served {{as head of the}} armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the <b>Liberian</b> government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The <b>Liberian</b> government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the <b>Liberian</b> Forestry Development Authority {{was created}} to manage and {{preserve}} the country's forest resources. A year later, in 1977, the Division of Wildlife and National Parks was formed {{under the leadership of}} Alexander Peal, who served as its head until 1990.|$|E

5|$|Under Samuel Doe the Coast Guard was retitled the <b>Liberian</b> Navy in 1986 {{through the}} passage of The <b>Liberian</b> Navy Act of 1986. The Aviation Unit was founded in 1970 with the {{delivery}} of three Cessna U-17C light aircraft. An Aviation Unit aircraft crashed at Spriggs-Payne in 1984. In 1985 it operated three fixed-wing aircraft from Spriggs Payne Airport in Monrovia, including Cessna 172s. Their duties included reconnaissance and transport of light cargo and VIPs. The Aviation Unit was expanded in the 1980s with the delivery of more Cessna aircraft: three 172s, a 206, 207 and two single engined turboprop 208s.|$|E

5|$|Instead Taylor {{ran down}} the Armed Forces, letting go 2,400–2,600 former personnel, {{many of whom were}} Krahn brought in by former President Doe, in December 1997 – January 1998, and {{building}} up instead the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), the Special Operations Division of the <b>Liberian</b> National Police, and the Special Security Service. On November 19, 1999, Taylor named General Kpenkpah Konah as the new Chief of Staff of the AFL (where he would stay until 2006) and John Tarnue as head of the army. Tarnue was later implicated in a land dispute in 1999, while acting as AFL commander.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{years after}} the end of the civil war in 2003, Liberia {{witnessed}} large improvements in security. As highlighted in the first Issue Brief of this series, people in Liberia generally feel much safer than in previous years, and many <b>Liberians</b> consider development issues a more pressing concern than security threats (Small Arms Survey, 2011). At the individual household level, however, the picture is somewhat less positive. Despite the overall national improvement, many <b>Liberians</b> still worry that someone in their household may become the victim of a crime...|$|R
