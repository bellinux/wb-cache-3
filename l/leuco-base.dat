40|$|A {{series of}} {{derivatives}} of Brilliant Green containing substituents in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring has been synthesised, together with some derivatives {{in which the}} phenyl ring {{has been replaced by}} a heterocyclic ring. The visible absorption spectra of the dyes have been correlated with the electronic and steric effects of the substituents. The effect on the x-band of ortho-substitution is consistent with the relief of steric hindrance by rotation of the phenyl ring. The perchiorates of a range of ortho-substituted and heterocyclic derivatives of Brilliant Green have been prepared from the corresponding <b>leuco-base</b> or carbinol. A study of the alkaline hydrolysis of each dye has been made under conditions such that pseudo first order kinetics obtained. The effects on the observed rate constant of changing the hydroxide ion concentration, the concentration of the inert salt and the temperature have been observed. The same basic rate law has been determined for most of the dyes. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis has been applied to the series of ortho-substituted dyes and the rate of hydrolysis has been demonstrated to be dependent mainly on the steric factor, U, derived by Charton. The thermodynamic parameters and have been obtained for the ortho-substituted dyes and the reaction has been shown to be under enthalpy control. An isokinetic relationship has been established providing evidence that most of the orthosubstituted dyes undergo hydrolysis by the same mechanism. A value for the steric factor, U, for the ortho-nitro-group has been determined, which shows that this group lies between its coplanar and orthogonal extremes in the dye. Anomalous behaviour, for which reasoned arguments are presented, has been observed for 2 -hydroxy-Brilliant Green, 2, 6 -dichloro-Brilli-ant Green and 2 -Furyl Green...|$|E
40|$|New diaza angular and tetraaza complex {{phenothiazine}} {{rings are}} synthesized and characterized. Alkaline hydrolysis of 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -hydroxy- 5 -thiocyanatopyrimidine in 20 % sodium hydroxide solution and neutralization with acetic acid gave 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -hydroxyprimidine- 5 -thiol (7). Base catalyzed (anhydrous sodium carbonate) condensation of this compound with 2, 3 -dichloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone in yielded the diaza heterocycle 10 -amino- 5 -chloro- 8 -hydroxybenzo[a]- 9, 11 -diazaphenothiazin- 5 -one(9). Further condensation of (9) with another molecule of (7) {{in the presence}} of anhydrous sodium carbonate gave the tetraaza heterocycle identified as 7, 14 -diamino- 9, 12 -dihydroxy- 6, 8, 13, 15 -tetraazabenzo[a][1, 4]benzothiazino[3, 2 -c]pheno thiazine, a deep red solid. The intense colour, high molar absorptivity of the new heterocycles and the ease re-oxidation of the reduced <b>leuco-bases</b> by atmospheric air (O 2) makes them suitable as vat dyes...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{number of}} novel, symmetrically or unsymmetrically substitutedtriphenylmethane dyes have been synthesised from their respective <b>leuco-bases</b> or carbinols. The terminal groups and substituents {{were chosen to}} give a good variation in structural and electronic properties. The rates of alkaline hydrolysis of the dyes at various hydroxide ion concentrations, ionic strengths, temperatures and in mixed solvents of varying composition have been investigated {{with a view to}} elucidating the mechanism of reaction and the nature of substituent effects. A complete reaction scheme for the acidic and basic hydrolysis of Pyrrolidine Green is advanced and the associated equilibrium constants have been calculated. The rate data obtained for some substituted PyrrolidineÂ·Greens have been used to test the applicability of an isokinetic relationship in the TPM system. The 4 -morpholino-and 4 -piperidino-Pyrrolidine Green dyes show enhanced reactivity relative to the other dyes studied and the reasons for this behaviour have been discussed. The thermodynamic parameters t. Ht and t::S* have been obtained for all the dyes and compared with data from the literature for related dyes. The effect of substitution and the influence of the tenninal group on the visible spectra of the dyes have been examined in solvents of varying acidity. The nature of the electrical and/or steric effects in some 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -substituted Pyrrolidine Greens has been examined by the analysis of both kinetic and spectroscopic data using single substituent parameter and multiparameter regression techniques. Substituent constants and electron donor potentials for a number of nitrogen-containing substituents have been interpolated. The light fastness of some Pyrrolidine Green derivatives has been measured and the commercial implications assessed...|$|R
