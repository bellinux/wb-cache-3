Methods and Results: The EO showed the prevalence of linalool (95 %, n = 5). It was bactericidal against the majority of tested strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0. 72 to 2. 89 mg ml(- 1) (Aer. hydrophila, Edwarsiella tarda, Vibrio furnissii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus garvieae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium). The fish was fed with 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 % leaf powder supplementation diets for 21 days. Nonspecific immunity parameters (lysozyme, haemolytic and bactericidal activities of plasma) were assessed 21 days after feeding period and before the experimental infection. Weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were improved by supplementation of L. cubeba in a dose-related manner, and a significant difference appeared at the highest dose (8 %) when compared to the control. The increase in plasma lysozyme was significant for all the treated groups. Haemolysis activity was higher for the groups fed with 4 and 8 % plant powder.

40|$|Essential oils (EOs) are {{recommended}} by some veterinarians to treat otitis externa in pets, but data about their efficacy in scientific literature are very scant. Methods: Nine commercial EOs, from roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis L.), star anise (Illicium verum), lavender (Lavandula hybrida), litsea (<b>Litsea</b> <b>cubeba</b> (Lour.) Pers.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), oregano (Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirticum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), clary sage (Salvia sclarea L.), and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) were tested against bacterial and fungal pathogens previously isolated from {{dogs and cats}} with otitis externa. In particular, the analyses were carried out against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudointermedius, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichosporon sp., and Rhodotorula sp. Results: O. vulgare and S. sclarea showed superior antibacterial activity, even if not against all the strains. Trichosporon sp., C. albicans, and A. terreus were insensitive to most Eos, while other yeasts and molds showed different degrees of sensitivity. In particular, most fungi were inhibited by O. vulgare and R. officinalis. Conclusions: The obtained results suggest that some EOs could be included in treatment as an alternative therapeutic option in bacterial otitis complicated by fungi, in association with conventional drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) {{is considered}} to be associated with oxidative stress, mononuclear leukocyte recruitment and infiltration, and matrix production and/or matrix degradation, although the exact etiology and pathogenic pathways remain to be determined. Establishment of a pathogenesis-based therapeutic strategy for the disease is clinically warranted. Citral (3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal), a major active compound in <b>Litsea</b> <b>cubeba,</b> a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, can inhibit oxidant activity, macrophage and NF-κB activation. In the present study, first, we used a mouse model of FSGS with the features of glomerular epithelial hyperplasia lesions (EPHLs), a key histopathology index of progression of FSGS, peri-glomerular inflammation, and progressive glomerular hyalinosis/sclerosis. When treated with citral for 28 consecutive days at a daily dose of 200 mg/kg of body weight by gavage, the FSGS mice showed greatly reduced EPHLs, glomerular hyalinosis/sclerosis and peri-glomerular mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, suggesting that citral may be renoprotective for FSGS and act by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis and early activating the Nrf 2 pathway. Meanwhile, a macrophage model involved in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities was employed and confirmed the beneficial effects of citra...|$|E
40|$|Non-small cell lung {{carcinoma}} (NSCLC) {{is a major}} {{killer in}} cancer related human death. Its therapeutic intervention requires superior efficient molecule(s) as it often becomes resistant to present chemotherapy options. Here we report that vapor of volatile oil compounds obtained from <b>Litsea</b> <b>cubeba</b> seeds killed human NSCLC cells, A 549, through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Vapor generated from the combined oils (VCO) deactivated Akt, {{a key player in}} cancer cell survival and proliferation. Interestingly VCO dephosphorylated Akt at both Ser 473 and Thr 308; through the suppression of mTOR and pPDK 1 respectively. As a consequence of this, diminished phosphorylation of Bad occurred along with the decreased Bcl-xL expression. This subsequently enhanced Bax levels permitting the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol which concomitantly activated caspase 9 and caspase 3 resulting apoptotic cell death. Impairment of Akt activation by VCO also deactivated Mdm 2 that effected overexpression of p 53 which in turn upregulated p 21 expression. This causes enhanced p 21 binding to cyclin D 1 that halted G 1 to S phase progression. Taken together, VCO produces two prong effects on lung cancer cells, it induces apoptosis and blocked cancer cell proliferation, both occurred due to the deactivation of Akt. In addition, it has another crucial advantage: VCO could be directly delivered to lung cancer tissu...|$|E
40|$|<b>Litsea</b> <b>cubeba</b> L., {{also named}} as Makauy, is a {{traditional}} herb and {{has been used as}} cooking condiment or tea brewing to treat diseases for aborigines. The present study was undertaken to explore the chemical compositions of the fruit essential oil of L. cubeba (LCEO) and the immunomodulatory effect of LCEO on dendritic cells and mice. The LCEO was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with direct injection (DI/GC) or headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME/GC). In total, 56 components were identified, of which 48 were detected by DI/GC and 49 were detected by HS-SPME/GC. The principal compounds were citral (neral and geranial). An immunosuppressive activity of LCEO was investigated with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) which have a critical role to trigger the adaptive immunity. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of LCEO on immune response was elucidated by performing the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in mice. Our results clearly showed that LCEO decreases the production of TNF-α and cytokine IL- 12 in a dose-dependent manner in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated DCs. CHS response and the infiltrative T cells were inhibited in the tested ears of the mice co-treated with LCEO. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the LCEO mainly containing citral exhibits an immunosuppressive effect on DCs and mice, indicating that LCEO can potentially be applied in the treatment of CHS, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{production}} and seed dispersal of two pioneer (<b>Litsea</b> <b>cubeba</b> and Lindera metcalfiana) and two shade-tolerant species (Cinnamomum soegengii and Cryptocarya densiflora) of Lauraceae were studied at a tropical lower montane forest in Doi Inthanon National Park, northern Thailand. Mature seed fall was monitored weekly to monthly using seed traps or belt transects for 1 - 3 trees per species. During the two-year study period, we observed only one fruiting episode {{for each of}} ten sample trees. Fruiting period was synchronized within each species, while there was no overlap in fruiting among the species. The seed fall periods were relatively short in Litsea (16 - 54 days), Lindera (25 - 65 days) and Cinnamomum (69 days), while quite long in Cryptocarya (159 - 187 days). The seed dispersal distance was short for all the species (< 12 m), and the density of seed dispersal had a mode at 0 - 2 m {{from the center of}} the canopy. The total seed production of each tree was estimated by a Weibull seed dispersal model as 93 - 6029, 985 - 3977, 1035 - 8910 and 6331 for Lindera, Litsea, Cryptocarya and Cinnamomum, respectively. Total fruit dry weight of each tree was estimated to be comparable to the leaf dry weight for Cryptocarya and Cinnamomum, while less than 3 % of the leaf dry weight for Lindera and Litsea...|$|E
