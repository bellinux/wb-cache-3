40|$|Defaults {{arising from}} {{illiquidity}} {{can lead to}} private workouts, formal bankruptcy proceedings or even liquidation. All these outcomes can result in deadweight losses. Corporate illiquidity {{in the presence of}} realistic capital market frictions can be managed by (a) equity dilution, (b) carrying positive cash balances, or (c) entering into <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> with a syndicate of lenders. An efficient way to manage illiquidity is to rely on mechanisms that transfer cash from "good states" into "bad states" (i. e., financial distress) without wasting liquidity in the process. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of costly equity dilution as a method to deal with illiquidity, and characterize its effects on corporate debt prices and optimal capital structure. We show that equity dilution produces lower firm value in general. Next, we consider two alternative mechanisms: cash balances and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments.</b> Abstracting from future investment opportunities and share re-purchases, which are strong reasons for corporate cash holdings, we show that carrying positive cash balances for managing illiquidity is in general inefficient relative to entering into <b>loan</b> <b>commitments,</b> since cash balances (a) may have agency costs, (b) reduce the riskiness of the firm thereby lowering the option value to default, (c) postpone or reduce dividends in good states, and (d) tend to inject liquidity in both good and bad states. <b>Loan</b> <b>commitments,</b> on the other hand, (a) reduce agency costs, and (b) permit injection of liquidity in bad states as and when needed. Then, we study the trade-offs between these alternative approaches to managing corporate illiquidity. We show that <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> can lead to an improvement in overall welfare and reduction in spreads on existing debt for a broad range of parameter values. We derive explicit pricing formulas for debt and equity prices. In addition, we characterize the optimal draw down strategy for <b>loan</b> <b>commitments,</b> and study its impact on optimal capital structure. <b>Loan</b> <b>commitment,</b> cash reserve, liquidity management, security pricing...|$|R

Both checking accounts and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> require the institution offering them to have a pool of liquidity.

The link between these two goes back all the way to medieval money changers; Kashyap et al. presented empirical evidence showing that banks which had more <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> tended to also have more checking accounts, and they showed why this is optimal for imperfectly correlated withdrawals and commitment takedowns because of the cost savings from accommodating both with a common pool of liquidity.|$|R

40|$|We {{rationalize}} {{fixed rate}} <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> (forward credit contracting with options) {{in a competitive}} credit market with universal risk neutraility. Future interest rates are random, {{but there are no}} transactions costs. Borrowers finance projects with bank loans and choose ex post unobseravable actions that affect project payoffs. Credit contract design by the bank is the outcome of a (non-cooperative) Nash game between the bank and the borrower. The initial formal analysis is basically in two steps. First, we show that the only spot credit market Nash equilibria that exist are inefficient {{in the sense that they}} result in welfare losses for borrowers due to the bank's informational handicap. Second, we show that <b>loan</b> <b>commitments,</b> because of their ability to weaken the link between the offering bank's expected profit and the loan interest rate, enable to the complete elimination of informationally induced welfare losses and thus produce an outcome that strictly Pareto dominates any spot market equilibrium. Perhaps our most surprising result is that, if the borrower has some initial liquidity, it is better for the borrower to use it now to pay a commitment fee and buy a <b>loan</b> <b>commitment</b> that entitles it to borrow in the future rather than save it for use as an inside equity in conjunction with spot borrowing. ...|$|R
