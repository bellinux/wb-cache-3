5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> and additional <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> is that the process of additional <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and <b>language</b> <b>acquisition.</b> Research in first <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second <b>language</b> <b>acquisition,</b> when adults learn a new language.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs.

He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with <b>language</b> <b>acquisition,</b> object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to <b>language</b> <b>acquisition</b> is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of video}} podcasts in {{education}} {{has emerged as}} a phenomenon that has gained a considerable amount of attention over the last few years. Although video podcasting is becoming a well-established technology in higher education, new multimedia instructional strategies such as student-created video podcasts in grades K- 12 are under-researched. The study investigated the effects of video podcasts created by students to promote foreign <b>language</b> grammar <b>acquisition</b> at the middle school level and find how students described such experience. The current investigation was conducted by using the explanatory sequential design, which is a mixed methods research design that occurs in two distinct interactive phases. The use of the explanatory sequential mix methods design allowed the collection of quantitative and qualitative data that served as corroborative evidence to answer three research questions: What differences in terms of achievement exist between middle school students who create a video podcast to promote foreign <b>language</b> grammar <b>acquisition</b> and students who followed a traditional instructional approach? How do the interviews with students help to understand their experiences when using a student-created video podcast as an instructional strategy to promote foreign <b>language</b> grammar <b>acquisition?</b> How can the experiences that emerge from the quantitative and qualitative data be useful to promote student achievement in other subject areas? Although quantitative results indicated that the use of student-created video podcasts by middle school students had no significant effect on foreign <b>language</b> grammar <b>acquisition,</b> the qualitative findings of this investigation provide insights for middle school educators, parents, school administrators, and stakeholders with respect to the experiences of middle school students when using this multimedia learning strategy.

Consequently, language instructors are required to adjust course materials, teaching objectives and didactic strategies in order to address the students’ adequate English language speaking abilities. The finality of these <b>language</b> <b>acquisitions</b> consists of equipping students with proper communicational tools which should allow them to be competitive agents on both the Romanian labor market and abroad.
