40|$|Future {{missions}} to Mars may require pin-point landing precision, possibly {{on the order}} of tens of meters. The ability to reach a target while meeting a dynamic pressure constraint to ensure safe parachute deployment is complicated at Mars by low atmospheric density, high atmospheric uncertainty, and the desire to employ only bank angle control. The vehicle aerodynamic performance requirements and guidance necessary for 0. 5 to 1. 5 <b>lift</b> <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> vehicle to maximize the achievable footprint while meeting the constraints are examined. A parametric study of the various factors related to entry vehicle performance in the Mars environment is undertaken to develop general vehicle aerodynamic design requirements. The combination of low <b>lift</b> <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> and low atmospheric density at Mars result in a large phugoid motion involving the dynamic pressure which complicates trajectory control. Vehicle ballistic coefficient is demonstrated to be the predominant characteristic affecting final dynamic pressure. Additionally, a speed brake is shown to be ineffective at reducing the final dynamic pressure. An adaptive precision entry atmospheric guidance scheme is presented. The guidance uses a numeric predictor-corrector algorithm to control downrange, an azimuth controller to govern crossrange, and analytic control law to reduce the final dynamic pressure. Guidance performance is tested against a variety of dispersions, and the results from selected tests are presented. Precision entry using bank angle control only is demonstrated to be feasible at Mars...|$|E

The tests were conducted at Mach numbers of 2. 3, 2. 96, 4. 0, and 4. 63. In some cases, the configuration with negative tail deflections yielded higher values of maximum <b>lift</b> <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> than did the configuration with an undeflected tail. This was due to body upwash acting on the tail and producing an additional lift increment with essentially no drag penalty.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method that {{makes use of}} deep neural {{networks}} and gradient decent to perform automated design on complex real world engineering tasks. Our approach works by training a neural network to mimic the fitness function of a design optimization task and then, using the differential nature of the neural network, perform gradient decent to maximize the fitness. We demonstrate this methods effectiveness by designing an optimized heat sink and both 2 D and 3 D airfoils that maximize the <b>lift</b> <b>drag</b> <b>ratio</b> under steady state flow conditions. We highlight that our method has two distinct benefits over other automated design approaches. First, evaluating the neural networks prediction of fitness can be orders of magnitude faster then simulating the system of interest.

These two strengths work together to overcome some of the current shortcomings of automated design. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
