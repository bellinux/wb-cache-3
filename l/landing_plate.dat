Experimental tests are practically only option to assess the behavior of glass and to certificate it. Glass may be assumed as isotropic material; mechanical properties do not depend on direction for orientation thus easy for modeling. Main issue once designing staircase landings assumptions of critical stress in particular as tensile and in certain extend bending strength of glass is not a constant value. This stress level depending on glass type, location of load and glass laminate panel compilation. This paper presents assessment of existing design practice in contrary to physical experiments of single glass stair <b>landing</b> <b>plate.</b> In order to perform an optimization task, a different kind of glass samples has been tested in 4 -point bending using testing equipment INSTRON 8802. Bending test settings are corresponding to LVS EN 1288 - 3 standard requirements and based on similar research performed earlier at DTU Netherlands. The results demonstrated that the glass mechanical and physical properties such as Young’s modulus, the Poisson ratio and the density, of the annealed and tempered glass are practically the same nevertheless the bending stress is depend on glass type...|$|E

The correlation peaks at a land-lead of about 36 yr with an average correlation distance of 200 km, with the implication of an average strain migration rate of 5. 6 km yr-l.

40|$|Quantifying past {{motions of}} tectonic plates in the {{southwest}} Pacific is important because the Pacific-Antarctic ridge is the only non-destructive boundary between the Pacific plate and other major plates. However, formation of sea-ice near Antarctica impairs the collection of magnetic anomaly data {{that are necessary to}} calculate plate rotations. A detailed analysis of all ship-track magnetic data available {{in the southwest}} Pacific (61 cruises, 153 profiles, including several cruises collected after 1995) is presented here. Four different sources of uncertainty are quantified: (1) confidence of magnetic anomaly identification, (2) magnetic reversal location picking precision, (3) ship navigation precision, and (4) magnetic data quality. Finite plate rotations are calculated for the southwest Pacific (42. 5 to 79 Ma) using the resulting magnetic anomaly database (1528 magnetic reversal data). Finite rotations were calculated using the Hellinger criterion, or by a new method presented here that assumes orthogonality between fracture zones and ridge segments. The new method requires less parameters and is hence able better estimate rotations in cases with an uneven distribution of sparse magnetic data. Rotations and formal uncertainties are calculated for thirty-one chrons (c 20 y to c 33 o). They confirm the existence of a three plate system (Pacific, Marie Byrd Land, Bellingshausen) in the southwest Pacific from before c 31 o (68. 7 Ma) until c 28 y (62. 5 Ma).

40|$|Interpretations of {{multichannel}} seismic (MCS) {{reflection and}} potential field {{data suggest that}} some prominent gravity anomalies in the Bellingshausen Sea are associated with plate boundaries that were active during the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. Between 83 degrees and 93 degreesW, a belt of negative anomalies extends along the West Antarctic continental slope, which we term the continental slope gravity anomaly (CSGA). MCS profiles show that the CSGA coincides with an acoustically opaque structural high imaged beneath the lower slope. We interpret this structure as {{the upper part of}} an accretionary prism which formed during southward subduction of the Phoenix and Charcot plates, before Chatham Rise separated from West Antarctica. MCS profiles crossing the same margin to the northeast show no evidence of an extensive buried accretionary prism, but instead reveal an abrupt northeastward steepening of the continental slope near 78 degreesW. We attribute this change in tectonic style, at least in part, to subduction erosion resulting from subduction of rough oceanic basement which formed at the Antarctic-Phoenix ridge after an abrupt decrease in spreading rate at chron 23 r (52 Ma). Near 95 degreesW, the Bellingshausen gravity anomaly (BGA) consists of a prominent low-high gravity couple which crosses the West Antarctic continental shelf, slope, and rise. The BGA corresponds to a buried asymmetric basement trough, where Cretaceous oceanic basement dips beneath more elevated basement to the east. The trough probably formed after subduction of Charcot plate ocean floor stalled at the nearby Antarctic Peninsula margin, {{near the end of the}} Cretaceous Normal Superchron. Ocean floor to the east of the BGA became attached to the Antarctic Peninsula, and the BGA trough subsequently accommodated a small amount of convergent motion between the Antarctic Peninsula and the ocean floor to the west (initially part of the Marie Byrd <b>Land</b> <b>plate</b> and later part of the Bellingshausen plate). Tectonism probably ceased at the BGAat chron 27 (61 Ma), as a result of a general plate reorganization in the South Pacific...|$|R
40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are expendable pump parts. New types of valve with a damper chamber without rubber or polyurethane seal and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction a valve with a damper chamber contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in damper chamber, – to define speed of <b>landing</b> of <b>plate</b> at the entrance in a damper chamber, – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of damper chamber as a result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve with a damper chamber. For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat. The computer three-dimensional parametric model of valve with a damper chamber has been developed for the valve assembly No. 7 of triplex single action pump. A paramet-ric model gives a possibility to change the height of getting up of plate H and the geometri-cal parameters of seat and plate and clearances in damper chamber.

40|$|Automated water-level data {{collected}} using vented pressure transducers deployed in Hanford Site Central Plateau wells commonly display more variability than manual tape measurements {{in response to}} barometric pressure fluctuations. To explain this difference, {{it was hypothesized that}} vented pressure transducers installed in some wells are subject to barometric pressure effects that reduce water-level measurement accuracy. Vented pressure transducers use a vent tube, which is open to the atmosphere at land surface, to supply air pressure to the transducer housing for barometric compensation so the transducer measurements will represent only the water pressure. When using vented transducers, the assumption is made that the air pressure between land surface and the well bore is in equilibrium. By comparison, absolute pressure transducers directly measure the air pressure within the wellbore. Barometric compensation is achieved by subtracting the well bore air pressure measurement from the total pressure measured by a second transducer submerged in the water. Thus, no assumption of air pressure equilibrium is needed. In this study, water-level measurements were collected from the same Central Plateau wells using both vented and absolute pressure transducers to evaluate the different methods of barometric compensation. Manual tape measurements were also collected to evaluate the transducers. Measurements collected during this study demonstrated that the vented pressure transducers over-responded to barometric pressure fluctuations due to a pressure disequilibrium between the air within the wellbores and the atmosphere at land surface. The disequilibrium is thought to be caused by the relatively long time required for barometric pressure changes to equilibrate between land surface and the deep vadose zone and may be exacerbated by the restriction of air flow between the well bore and the atmosphere due to the presence of sample pump <b>landing</b> <b>plates</b> and well caps. The disequilibrium is likely limited to wells screened across the water table (i. e., open to the deep vadose zone) where the depth to water is large or a low-permeability layer occurs in the vadose zone. Such wells are a pathway for air movement between the deep vadose zone and land surface and this sustains the pressure disequilibrium between the well bore and the atmosphere for longer time periods. Barometric over-response was not observed with the absolute pressure transducers because barometric compensation was achieved by directly measuring the air pressure within the well. Users of vented pressure transducers {{should be aware of the}} over-response issue in certain Hanford Site wells and ascertain if it will affect the use of the data. Pressure disequilibrium between the well and the atmosphere can be identified by substantial air movement through the wellbore. In wells exhibiting pressure disequilibrium, it is recommended that absolute pressure transducers be used rather than vented transducers for applications that require precise automated determinations of well water-level changes in response to barometric pressure fluctuations...|$|R
