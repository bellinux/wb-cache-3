500|$|It is {{believed}} that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes {{has been compared to}} the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter has noted, [...] "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> I am used to it." [...] He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating.|$|E
500|$|Landis {{felt that}} the Black Sox scandal had been {{initiated}} by people involved in horse racing, and stated that [...] "by God, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{anything to do with}} this game, they'll never get another hold on it." [...] In 1921, his first season as commissioner, New York Giants owner Charles Stoneham and manager John McGraw purchased Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. Landis gave Stoneham and McGraw an ultimatum—they could not be involved in both baseball and horse racing. They quickly put the track back on the market.|$|E

500|$|In July 2007, it was {{announced}} that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records America was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. Jackson's tenth studio album, Discipline, which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, [...] "I wanted to name the album Discipline because {{it has a lot of}} different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have...</b> And to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after dark}} on 31 March, Langlais told Major Marcel Bigeard, who {{was leading the}} defense at [...] "Eliane", to fall back across the river. Bigeard refused, saying [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> one man alive I won't let go of 'Eliane 4'. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for." [...] The night of the 31st, the 316th Division {{attacked}} [...] "Eliane 2". Just as it appeared the French {{were about to be}} overrun, a few French tanks arrived, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on [...] "Eliane 4" [...] were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured [...] "Huguette 7", only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on 1 April.|$|E
500|$|The Skinker family {{announced}} that any gentleman who [...] "would {{take her to}} his bed after loyall Matrimony" [...] would receive a dowry of £40,000. The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted {{a large number of}} would-be husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent the greater part of a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, [...] "hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke." [...] An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that [...] "so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout".|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told her}} that I would be her brother, and that <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a {{shilling}} she should never want sixpence. And I mean it. And as for what you say about romance and repenting it, that simply comes from your being a lawyer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{forced me}} into a corner," [...] McFarlane said to Wayland, peevishly. [...] "I lied out of one night; but they {{know that you were}} here last night.

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Grimaldi {{and his son}} first became strained during the early 1820s. JS, who had {{made a career of}} emulating his father's act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. [...] He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. [...] JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. [...] In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS {{went out of his way}} to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money. JS once replied: [...] "At present I am in difficulties; but as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a shilling you shall have half". [...] However, there is no record of him ever sending money to his father. JS finally returned home in 1827, when the Grimaldis were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in the business, there are very few firsts." ...|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Stobell {{started and}} eyed her indignantly. [...] "So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> him <b>I</b> didn’t want {{anything}} else," [...] she said, stiffly. [...] "We {{were all in}} all to each other; he couldn’t bear me out of his sight. I remember once, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone to see my poor mother, he sent me three telegrams in thirty-five minutes telling me to come home." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{working as}} a foreign {{correspondent}} for the American journal The Living Age, Fry visited Berlin in 1935, and personally witnessed Nazi abuse against Jews {{on more than one}} occasion, which [...] "turned him into an ardent anti-Nazi". He said in 1945, [...] "I could not remain idle <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any chances at all of saving even a few of its intended victims." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{scouting}} my expostulations, {{he commanded}} the longboat, bidding me {{be ready to}} go ashore with him. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do but to say farewell to MacMuir and Lowrie and Auctherlonnie, which was hard enough. For the honest first mate <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a great liking, and was touched beyond speech when he enjoined me to keep his shore suit <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> want of it.|$|R

2500|$|GAA President Christy Cooney {{said the}} events were a [...] "watershed" [...] and {{one where the}} [...] "{{circumstances}} were bizarre. I have never seen circumstances like it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been a member of}} this Association". He promised life bans for those who assaulted the referee.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{frequently}} {{makes use}} of Gene Hunt's comical rudeness {{in the form of}} jokes and dramatic irony about a future which the audience already knows, but which the characters in 1973 do not. For example, in Series 1: Episode 5, Hunt declares, [...] "There will never be a woman prime minister as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a hole in my arse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] he said, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "the {{adventure}} here {{which was}} most interesting to me, which I shall never forget so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> live, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not written about at all. It is for the memory only." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{was what}} {{happened}} to us, among whom were men of the 24th, Natal Carabineers and Mounted Police.

With my very last cartridge I killed the Captain Indudu {{who had been in}} charge of the escort that conducted me to the Tugela. He had caught sight of me and called out-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Again Eliza fixed a musing {{look upon}} her. [...] "I reckon {{if the truth}} was known your aunt Celia was nigher to being your mother than I ever was. They always said you was all Wetherford, and I reckon they were right. I always liked men better than babies. So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> your father, you didn't count--now that's the God's truth. And I didn't intend that you should ever come back here. I urged you to stay--you know that." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his autobiography, Mansell {{claimed that}} his final race with the Lotus team—the 1984 Portuguese Grand Prix—was heavily {{compromised}} by Warr's unwillingness to give Mansell the brake pads he desired for the race. With 18 laps {{of the race}} remaining, and with Mansell in second position, the brakes on his car failed. On Mansell's departure, Warr {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "He'll never win a Grand Prix as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a hole in my arse".|$|E
2500|$|And {{going around}} with the master mason, {{examining}} which figures to leave and which to destroy, the priest spotted a Saint Anthony and said: 'Save this one.' Then he found a figure of Saint Sano and said: 'This one is to be gotten rid of, since as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been the Priest here I have never seen anyone light a candle in front of it, nor has it ever seemed to me useful; therefore, mason, get rid of it.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Exact set lists {{during this}} tour are still sketchy, due partly {{to the lack}} of early live Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings. Old Yardbirds' live staples such as [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'", [...] "Dazed and Confused", [...] "White Summer" [...] and {{possibly}} [...] "For Your Love" [...] were performed, in addition to material from the as yet unfinished debut album, such as: [...] "Communication Breakdown", I Can't Quit You Baby, [...] "You Shook Me", [...] "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You", and [...] "How Many More Times". The band also likely performed a Garnet Mimms cover, [...] "As <b>Long</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> You".|$|E
60|$|But, I reflected, I {{ought not}} to be surprised. His whole career, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known him, had been dotted with little eccentricities of a type which an unfeeling world {{generally}} stigmatises as shady. They were small things, it was true; but they ought to have warned me. We are most of us wise after the event. When the wind has blown, we can generally discover a multitude of straws which should have shown us which way it was blowing.|$|R
60|$|When {{one takes}} service with Deceit, one signs a {{contract}} that one may not break but under penalty. Maybe {{it was good for}} my health, those lonely runs; but oh, they were dreary! By a process of argument not uncommon I persuaded myself that truth was a matter of mere words, that so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> actually gone over the ground I described I was not lying. To further satisfy my conscience, I bought a big satchel and scattered from it torn-up paper <b>as</b> <b>I</b> ran.|$|R

'And I told,' again {{broke in}} Helen, 'how Cousin Hugh {{said it was}} an honour and a glory to be burnt like you; and I told him how I got the water and should have put out the fire, if that horrid Simmonds had not carried me away, and <b>I</b> wish he <b>had</b> not.
