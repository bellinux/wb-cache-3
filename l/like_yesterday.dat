Opposing captain Daniel Vettori, who conceded that they were already on the back foot after letting Chennai score 205, said [...] "Would have been a much better game {{if we could have}} put up a bowling {{performance}} <b>like</b> <b>yesterday,</b> but it was not to be. I think 200-plus was tough for us; 160–170 would have been chaseable." ...|$|E

The close {{seclusion}} in which Romola's trouble had kept her in the weeks preceding her flight and his arrest, had denied him the opportunity he had sought of seeing the Wife who lived in the Via de' Bardi: and at this moment the descriptions he had heard of the fair golden-haired woman were all gone, <b>like</b> <b>yesterday's</b> waves.|$|R

2500|$|In the 13th century, Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre {{made the}} insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be {{measured}} in divine years, not human years. Psalm 90:4 says, [...] "For a thousand years in thy sight are but <b>like</b> <b>yesterday</b> when it is past, and like a watch in the night." [...] Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, {{that we are in}} the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.|$|E

5000|$|At age 14, Frum was a {{campaign}} volunteer for an Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Jan Dukszta for the 1975 provincial election. During the hour-long bus/subway/bus ride each way {{to and from}} the campaign office in western Toronto, he read a paperback edition of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, which his mother had given to him. [...] "My campaign colleagues jeered at the book [...] - [...] {{and by the end of}} the campaign, any lingering interest I might have had in the political left had vanished <b>like</b> <b>yesterday’s</b> smoke." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band's early gigs {{included}} several at the Windsor Castle and a residency at the Elgin. [...] They {{were supported by}} the Sex Pistols at the Nashville Room on 3 April 1976; this is when Strummer claimed he saw the light and got involved in the punk scene. Joe Strummer commented on this event in the Don Letts documentary Westway to the World {{on the end of}} the 101ers by saying [...] "5 seconds into their (the Pistols') first song, I knew we were <b>like</b> <b>yesterday's</b> paper, we were over." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was there}} all the time, Jack," [...] I cried, in a fever of exaltation: [...] "and I heard every word of it!

60|$|The old couple sit side by side, and the {{old time}} seems <b>like</b> <b>yesterday</b> indeed.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} it is," [...] said he, [...] "but I had hoped for so much from his return. But surely his hand was not tied up <b>like</b> that <b>yesterday.</b> What can be the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But please don't look <b>like</b> <b>yesterday.</b> To-day's too heavenly. Oh! I love {{beautiful}} days, and I love riding, and--" [...] She {{broke off}} {{and looked at}} him. 'Why can't you just be nice to me'--she seemed to be saying--'and love me as you ought!' That was her power--the conviction that he did, and ought to love her; that she ought to and did love him. How simple! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sense of}} life's {{continuity}} depended on trifling bodily impressions. The trivialities of daily existence were an armour for the soul. And this thought reinforced the inward quietness of Razumov {{as he began}} to climb the stairs familiar to his feet in the dark, with his hand on the familiar clammy banister. The exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day resemble another. To-morrow would be <b>like</b> <b>yesterday.</b>|$|E
6000|$|All {{this was}} to him <b>like</b> <b>{{yesterday}},</b> a long yesterday a yesterday gone over innumerable times, analysed meditated upon for years. It had a vividness and force for that old man of which his daughter {{who had not been}} shut out of the world could have no idea. She was to him the only living figure out of that past, and it was perhaps in perfect good faith that he added, coldly, inexpressive and thin-lipped: [...] "I lived only for you, I may say. I suppose you understand that. There were only you and me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{had spoken}} to me <b>like</b> that <b>yesterday,</b> I'd have wanted to punch your head," [...] he said. [...] "But you're a good fellow, Roger, and I don't blame you for acting as you do. Do {{you know what the}} papers contain?" ...|$|R

2500|$|YMO were {{pioneers of}} synthpop, a genre {{development}} Simon Reynolds believes to be [...] "perhaps {{the single most}} significant event in melodic music since Mersey-beat" [...] with its influence still evident in contemporary rock and pop music. In 1993, Johnny Black of Hi-Fi News, in a review for the record Hi-Tech/No Crime, described YMO as [...] "the most adventurous and influential electro-techno-dance technicians the world has produced" [...] and further argued that [...] "without them (and Kraftwerk) today's music would still sound <b>like</b> <b>yesterday's</b> music." [...] In 2001, Jason Ankeny of the Allmusic Guide to Electronica described YMO as [...] "a seminal influence on contemporary electronic music – hugely popular {{both at home and}} abroad" [...] and placed them [...] "second only to Kraftwerk as innovators of today's electronic culture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember!" [...] I cried with enthusiasm, for at {{that moment}} the thought {{occurred}} to my own mind; [...] "how can I ever forget it, Jack? It seems to me just <b>like</b> <b>yesterday.</b> I can hardly believe that six long years have passed since we drank that delicious natural lemonade out of the green cocoa-nuts, and wandered on the coral beach, and visited Penguin Island, and dived into the cave to escape the pirates. The whole scene rises up before me so vividly that I could fancy we were still there. Ah! these were happy times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eet {{is not the}} air. I am {{to relate}} to you a secret of verree fine value. Listen me, Meester Tansee. At the age of twenty-three I arrive in Mexico from Spain. When?

Three hundred ninety-six year ago I learn the secret always to leeve. Look at these clothes I war--at these diamantes.

60|$|The miracle is ended, for the {{starling}} {{has begun}} its job; {{and the sun}} is fretting those dark, busy wings with gold. Full day has come again. But the face of it is a little strange, it is not <b>like</b> <b>yesterday.</b> Queer-to think, no day is like to a day that's past and no night like a night that's coming! Why, then, fear death, which is but night? Why care, if next day have different face and spirit? The sun has lighted buttercup-field now, the wind touches the lime-tree. Something passes over me away up there.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Sam, you're {{the doctor}} and what you say goes. I {{certainly}} don't want to act <b>like</b> I did <b>yesterday</b> again," [...] and poor Tom looked greatly worried.|$|R
6000|$|Presently turning sharp to {{the right}} (south-east), we struck across a second divide, far more shallow than the first; and fell into the {{northern}} basin of the great Dámah valley, also known as El-Rahabah, [...] "the Open;"--the Rehoboth ("spaces") of the Hebrews. <b>Like</b> <b>yesterday's,</b> the loose red sand is Hismá; {{and it is also}} scattered with Harrah lava. After a four hours' ride we halted to enable the caravan to come up. Our Shaykhs were bent upon making twelve miles the average day's work; and their [...] "little game" [...] was now to delay as much as possible. Here we again found flocks of sheep and goats tended by young girls, who ran away like ostriches, and by old women who did not: on the contrary, Sycorax enjoyed asking the news and wrangling over a kid. The camels throughout this country seem to be always under the charge of men or boys.|$|R

6000|$|... "A {{thousand}} thanks {{that you}} could, {{in a day}} <b>like</b> <b>yesterday,</b> find the moment to think of your Friends, and to employ yourself for them.

6000|$|... "Thank you, Ida, {{the same}} to you; you have got most of your Christmases before you, {{which is more than}} I have. God bless me, it only seems <b>like</b> <b>yesterday</b> since the big bunch of holly tied to the hook in the ceiling there fell down on the breakfast table and smashed all the cups, and yet it is more than sixty years ago. Dear me! how angry my poor mother was. She never could bear the crockery to be broken--it was a little failing of your grandmother's," [...] and he laughed more heartily than Ida had heard him do for some weeks.|$|E
60|$|I {{reached the}} moor--I stood {{again on the}} brow of the hill--I looked on along the path--and there were the {{familiar}} garden trees in the distance, the clear sweeping semicircle of the drive, the high white walls of Limmeridge House. The chances and changes, the wanderings and dangers of months and months past, all shrank and shrivelled to nothing in my mind. It was <b>like</b> <b>yesterday</b> since my feet had last trodden the fragrant heathy ground. I thought I should see her coming to meet me, with her little straw hat shading her face, her simple dress fluttering in the air, and her well-filled sketch-book ready in her hand.|$|E
