At this point, there is a real need for better understanding of the factors hindering the deployment of mobile payments. We conducted several series of interviews involving key Swiss experts to elicit the preferences of the different industries involved in the mobile payment market.

We then examine these effects empirically for Costa Rica during the 20 th century using an econometric approach that addresses the irreversibilities in deforestation. We find significant effects of the relative returns to forest on deforestation rates. Thus, carbon payments would induce conservation and also carbon sequestration, and if land users were poor could conserve forest while addressing rural poverty. However, we find poorer areas are less responsive to returns. This and transaction costs could <b>lead</b> carbon <b>payments</b> policies not to be focused upon the poor. Other practical considerations may also dampen an understandable enthusiasm for service-based payments addressing both environment and inequality. Nonetheless, as the poor live in areas with more forest, they may benefit most from payments.

The {{objective of this}} paper is to assess the effects of CAP trends on the montado ecosystem in southern Portugal in terms of land, labour and capital allocation and farm income. A positive mathematical supply model disaggregated by the main montado agro-forestry production system in the Alentejo region is developed. The results show that decoupling payments of CAP have important economic effects and the foreseen increases in prices do not compensate the loss of the Agenda 2000 area payments. ...|$|R
40|$|Medicare administers a {{traditional}} public fee-for-service (FFS) plan while also allowing enrolles to join government-funded private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. We model how selection and differential payments - {{the value of}} the capitation payments the firm receives to insure an individual minus the counterfactual cost of his coverage in FFS - change after the introduction of a comprehensive risk adjustment formula in 2004. Our model predicts that firm screening efforts along dimensions included in the model ("extensive-margin" selection) should fall, whereas screening efforts along dimensions excluded ("intensive-margin" selection) should increase. These endogenous responses to the risk-adjustment formula can in fact <b>lead</b> differential <b>payments</b> to increase. Using individual-level administrative data on Medicare enrollees from 1994 to 2006, we show that while MA enrollees are positively selected throughout the sample period, after risk adjustment extensive-margin selection decreases whereas intensive-margin selection increases. We find that differential payments actually rise after risk-adjustment, and estimate that they totaled $ 23 billion in 2006, or about six percent of total Medicare spending.

Using daily data on U. S. defense spending (announced and actual payments), we document that the dollar immediately and strongly appreciates after announcements about future government spending. In contrast, actual <b>payments</b> <b>lead</b> to no discernible effect on the exchange rate.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of multitasking to <b>lead</b> to fixed <b>payments</b> instead of incentive schemes are identified. It is shown that the primary determinant of whether multitasking leads to higher or lower powered incentives is the role that noncontractible outputs play in helping the agent deal with the production risk associated with the observable and contractible outputs. When the noncontractible outputs are risk substitutes and are socially undesirable, standards are never optimal. If the noncontractible outputs are socially desirable, standards are never optimal if the noncontractible outputs play a risk-complementary role. 1...|$|R

Since providing this service can <b>lead</b> to <b>payments</b> to owners of vehicles, it effectively reduces the cost of {{electric vehicles}}. Using data from a national stated preference survey (n = 3029), this paper presents the first study of the potential consumer demand for V 2 G electric vehicles. In our choice experiment, 3029 respondents compared their preferred gasoline vehicle with two V 2 G electric vehicles. The V 2 G vehicles were described {{by a set of}} electric vehicle attributes and V 2 G contract requirements such as “required plug-in time” and “guaranteed minimum driving range”. The contract requirements specify a contract between drivers and a power aggregator for providing reserve power to the grid. Our findings suggest the V 2 G concept is mostly likely to help EVs on the market if power aggregators operate on pay-as-you-go-basis or provide consumers with advanced cash payment (upfront discounts on the price of EVs) in exchange for V 2 G restrictions. electric vehicles, vehicle-to-grid, stated preference, latent-class model...|$|R

We show that a suitable generalization of the Vickrey-Clark-Groves mechanism, based on the marginal contribution of each agent, leads to truthtelling in every period. A leading example of a dynamic allocation model is the sequential auction of a single good in which the current winner of the object receives additional information about her valuation.

40|$|Empirical and {{experimental}} papers find that high-powered incentives may reduce performance rather than improve it; a phenomenon {{referred to as}} choking under pressure. We show that competition for high ability workers nevertheless leads firms to offer high bonus payments, thereby deliberately accepting pressure-induced performance reductions. Bonus payments allow for a separating equilibrium in which only high ability workers choose high-powered incentive contracts. Low ability workers receive fixed payments and produce their maximum output which, however, is still below the reduced output of high ability workers. Bonus <b>payments</b> <b>lead</b> to a social loss which is increasing {{in the degree of}} competition.
