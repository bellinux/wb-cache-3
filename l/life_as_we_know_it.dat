5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood {{is in the form}} of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's thirteenth writing credit and Kretchmer's eleventh directing credit for the series. The episode features several notable guest appearances. Dan Castellaneta, {{best known as the}} voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, appears as Dr. Kinny, a sociology professor. Rider Strong guest stars as a student who participates as a guard in the experiment. The episode features a guest appearance by Samm Levine, best known for his role on Freaks and Geeks. Levine had previously worked with series star Chris Lowell on <b>Life</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>It,</b> a show that had been cancelled in 2005. Rachelle Lefevre, known for her later roles as Victoria in The Twilight Saga and in Under the Dome, guest stars as Marjorie, one of the sorority girls who becomes friends with Veronica.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{drawbacks}} to the pulsar timing method: pulsars are relatively rare, and special circumstances are required for a planet to form around a pulsar.

25|$|However, the {{question}} of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, the radiation, and the host stars plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated. Liquid water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters.|$|E

25|$|The {{observed}} {{values of}} the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen {{in the early universe}} to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{observations}} {{have shown}} that comets contain complex organic compounds. These are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids, essential ingredients for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Comets {{are thought to have}} delivered a vast quantity of water to Earth, and they may have also seeded Earth with organic molecules. Rosetta and Philae will also search for organic molecules, nucleic acids (the building blocks of DNA and RNA) and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) by sampling and analysing the comet's nucleus and coma cloud of gas and dust, helping assess the contribution comets made to the beginnings of life on Earth. Before succumbing to falling power levels, Philae COSAC instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet's atmosphere.|$|E
