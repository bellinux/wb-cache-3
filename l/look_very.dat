5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds <b>look</b> <b>very</b> different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids <b>look</b> <b>very</b> similar to sea anemones, but belong to {{an entirely different}} subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would <b>look</b> <b>very</b> well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E

60|$|The {{other one}} {{sat on a}} tuft of grass, eating {{something}} that <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> nice; but, all of a sudden, she dropped her bowl, and ran away, <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> much frightened.|$|R

5|$|Spring onions or salad onions may {{be grown}} from the Welsh onion (A. fistulosum), {{as well as}} from A. cepa. Young plants of A. fistulosum and A. cepa <b>look</b> <b>very</b> similar, but may be {{distinguished}} by their leaves, which are circular in cross-section in A. fistulosum rather than flattened on one side.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse's mother, Luann Van Houten, {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in this episode. She was designed to <b>look</b> <b>very</b> similar to Milhouse. Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he got {{from one of his}} wife's friends.|$|E
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not <b>look</b> <b>very</b> different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
6000|$|Oh she <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> pretty, she <b>looked</b> <b>very,</b> very pretty! If {{the father}} of the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his son, and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself, and had the {{happiness}} to make her loving as well as loveable! ...|$|R

50|$|However, this {{standard}} maps the Armenian full stop (whose glyph <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> {{close to the}} ASCII colon) in code value 4C and the Armenian abbreviation mark (that <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar to an angular grave accent) in code value 4F, that are both missing from all ArmSCII code charts.|$|R
5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held {{a hearing}} on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to <b>look</b> <b>very</b> unrealistic to mitigate the violence. Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often <b>look</b> <b>very</b> different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand {{out in the world}} screens. The cities were designed to not <b>look</b> <b>very</b> fantastical, so as to make the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process {{to give the impression that}} the people of the city were living both literally and figuratively under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E

25|$|European earwig nymphs <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{similar to}} their adult {{counterparts}} except {{that they are a}} lighter color. The young go through four nymphal stages and do not leave the nest until after the first moult.|$|E
25|$|Characters shi シ and tsu ツ, and so ソ and n(g) ン, <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{similar in}} print {{except for the}} slant and stroke shape. These {{differences}} in slant and shape are more prominent when written with an ink brush.|$|E
25|$|The ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} is {{the type}} species for the genus Campephilus, a group of large American woodpeckers. Although they <b>look</b> <b>very</b> similar to the pileated woodpeckers, they are not close relatives as the pileated {{is a member of}} the genus Dryocopus.|$|E

25|$|There may be dust {{along the}} line of sight from the GRB to Earth, both in the host galaxy and in the Milky Way. If so, the light will be {{attenuated}} and reddened and an afterglow spectrum may <b>look</b> <b>very</b> different from that modeled.|$|E
25|$|In print, {{the letter}} ÿ (lowercase y with diaeresis) and ij <b>look</b> <b>very</b> different, {{but in the}} {{handwriting}} of most Dutch speakers, ÿ, ij and Y, IJ look identical. Fortunately, since the y occurs only in loanwords, the letter ÿ is extremely rare (if not altogether non-existent) in Dutch.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between the Cyclic epics and Homer is also bound up in this question. As told by Proclus, the plots of the six non-Homeric epics <b>look</b> <b>very</b> much as though they are designed to integrate with Homer, with no overlaps with one another.|$|E

25|$|The colours applied on {{this horse}} further enhance the lifelikeness of the horse, making it <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{similar to a}} real horse. The {{contrast}} of green against brown on this sculpture, directs the viewer’s attention immediately to the elaborate harness on the horse, so that viewers would notice the distinctive decoration on this harness.|$|E
25|$|Byblis species <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{similar to}} Drosera and Drosophyllum, but are {{distinguished}} by their zygomorphic flowers, with five curved stamens {{off to one}} side of the pistil. These genera are in fact not closely related; modern classifications place Byblis in the Lamiales, while the sundews and Drosophyllum are now placed in the Caryophyllales.|$|E
25|$|The mandibles of O. bauri are {{an exaggerated}} {{form of the}} sturdy and long mandibles found in many ant species. Additionally, the muscles found in the mandibles of O. bauri are found in other ants, {{although}} those found in O. bauri are large and <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{similar to those found}} in cicadas.|$|E
