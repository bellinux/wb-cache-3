500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought." [...] Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, [...] "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E

500|$|While Confessions {{was still}} in production, Usher promised [...] "real talk" [...] in it. He decided [...] "to let it all hang out by singing about {{some of his own}} little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets." [...] He explained: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal". Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the World Hockey Association, a major {{professional}} league {{proposed to}} rival the NHL, held an Entry Draft on July 17, 2004. Holding the first overall selection, Toronto chose Crosby. The following month, {{it was reported}} that Crosby turned down a US$7.5million deal over three years to play for Hamilton. Crosby told reporters that while [...] "it took a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to that much money", he [...] "work hard most of his life to play in the NHL." [...] The deal would have paid him $2.5 million annually and an additional $2 million payout regardless of whether the WHA was realized as a legitimate league or not. It was not clarified, however, how Hamilton could have signed Crosby, as Toronto held his WHA rights. Nevertheless, the WHA never materialized.|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|... a {{realization}} {{of something that}} we'd wanted {{to be from the}} beginning," [...] Foreman explains. [...] "When we were signed to re:think Records , the goal was to get the music out to everybody. [...] when Sparrow [...] bought re:think Records, it was evident that our music wasn't {{going to be in the}} hands of everybody. As a Christian, I have a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> within the walls of the church. But also, as a Christian, I've got a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just about life in general ... So to be able to be on Columbia and on Sparrow felt like the realization of the two sides of what we had to say. It's a dream come true to be able to have songs that are outside of the box." ...|$|E

[...] "You must arrange to come and dine with us immediately; it's only because I've been so steeped in misery that I didn't write to you the other day--directly after you had called.

2500|$|Another {{controversial}} film at {{that time}} was [...] (1997), where Basu Bhattacharya, making the last film of his career, cast her as a housewife who moonlights as a prostitute.

I don't have problems playing anything. I've reached a stage where I could do justice to any role that came my way. It could be role of a mother, a sister-in-law; negative, positive, sensational or anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tony Kubek {{initially}} {{had trouble}} {{adjusting to the}} world of broadcasting. Although he had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek [...] "He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this policy, in the same Washington Post article, Dr. Myers stated that: [...] "I was {{recently}} informed by the director of data research at U.S. News, the person at the magazine who has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about how the rankings are computed, that absent students' SAT scores, the magazine will calculate the college's ranking by assuming an arbitrary average SAT score of one standard deviation (roughly 200 points) below the average score of our peer group. In other words, in the absence of real data, they will make up a number. He made clear to me that he believes that schools that do not use SAT scores in their admission process are admitting less capable students and therefore should lose points on their selectivity index." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamlett was {{receptive}} to dissenting {{views about the}} progress of the war, most notably arranging for Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). [...] "Vann had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about what was going on}} in Vietnam, which was completely counter to the reports we were receiving through JCS channels. And they were so different that I wanted him to brief the Chiefs." [...] On his own authority, Hamlett scheduled the briefing for July 8, 1963, but it was canceled at the last minute by Army chief of staff Earle G. Wheeler at the behest of JCS chairman Maxwell D. Taylor, whose protÃ©gÃ©, General Paul D. Harkins, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, was producing the optimistic reports that Vann's briefing was intended to contradict.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{really want}} to give you the lowdown on the SW re-formation but there's {{honestly}} not a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Legal issues prevented me from doing my own band on my own terms {{over the past couple of}} years but thankfully those problems are all resolved now. The kind of stuff happens sometimes. I won't deny that those problems - which were really just the culmination of many years of a lot of other b.s. - left a foul taste in my mouth about SW. But now that all the headaches are behind me I'm feeling great about it. I'm finally running my own band again and I'm really happy and excited to be back at it. I've got a killer line-up [...] myself, Danny Vapid, Simon Lamb (the Ritalins), Justin Perkins (Yesterday's Kids) and Adam Cargin (Blueheels) (he's also the new Riverdales drummer) and we've got a great set list." ...|$|E
5000|$|McConnell said of {{his role}} as Ro Nevin: [...] "They're pushing the {{boundary}} just like Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek.

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I figured I had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and there were so many things I wanted to express â€“ and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from critics. Jonah Krakow of IGN gave the episode a 9.7 calling it [...] "Incredible" [...] and also stated [...] "Most sitcoms don't {{have as many}} water-cooler moments as serialized adventure shows like Lost or 24, but I know this episode of Community will be an exception." [...] Jason Hughes gave the episode a positive review saying [...] "Like most action movies, there isn't a whole <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the plot.
