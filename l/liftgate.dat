25|$|Available in 2006 Route 66 Edition was {{finished}} in either Solar Yellow or Black. This version featured Solar Yellow brake calipers, body-color grille, solar-tinted sunscreen glass, <b>liftgate</b> mounted spoiler, 17-inch all-season performance tires, four-wheel anti-lock brakes with low-speed traction control, speed control, and a sport suspension. Brightwork accents included chrome body-side moldings, a chrome exhaust tip and , chrome-plated, and five-spoke Empire aluminum wheels. Exterior identification included a 'Street Cruiser' badge with Solar Yellow accents on the <b>liftgate</b> and 'Route 66' badges {{on the front}} doors. A total of 1443 Route 66 models were produced in North America, with 142 of those equipped with 5 speed manual transmissions.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} CR-V {{went on sale}} in the US in late September 2006, as the 2007 model year. The {{third generation}} CR-V was launched for the 2007 model year. Unlike preceding models it features a rear <b>liftgate</b> rather than a side-opening rear door and {{no longer has the}} spare tire mounted on the rear door.|$|E
50|$|Stampings and {{assemblies}} including hoods, roofs, <b>liftgates,</b> side apertures, fenders {{and floor}} pans. These provided parts {{for the many}} Chrysler vehicles, including {{in recent years the}} Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram Trucks.|$|R
50|$|The Caliber in Japan {{joined the}} Chrysler PT Cruiser in 2007, as the PT Cruiser was offered since 2000, {{but as with}} {{previous}} Chrysler products sold in Japan, the width dimension exceeded Japanese Government dimension regulations, and Japanese consumers were liable for annual taxes for driving a larger car which affected sales. As Chrysler products were considered large to the Japanese market, Chrysler offered products that offered spacious interiors with four doors and one piece <b>liftgates</b> to broaden their appeal to the Japanese as a compromise for paying the annual tax for large vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Truck tents are {{basically}} conventional 2-3 person tents that are rigged {{to hook up}} to a truck bed. Most truck tents are designed with {{a particular type of}} truck in mind, or a truck with certain features — those with dropgates, <b>liftgates,</b> camper tops, short beds, or long beds, etc. The tents either hook in or strap in to several locations around the truck. The initial set up may take some time, but is fairly simple after one or two attempts. Once the tent is fitted to a specific truck, setting up is as easy as setting up traditional tent. Many proponents choose to put a mattress in the bed of the truck for a more comfortable experience. These mattresses are available in various sizes to fit all trucks. A zip up window provides access to the cab for trucks that have a rear window.|$|R
25|$|The {{hatchback}} coupe {{features a}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The notchback sedan {{had the lowest}} price {{and is the only}} Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up <b>liftgate.</b> A panel delivery based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary front passenger seat was optional.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Life {{represented}} Honda's {{efforts in}} {{competing in the}} kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a <b>liftgate</b> installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E
25|$|The RX {{was built}} on a unibody chassis. Its {{exterior}} design was not typical of existing four-door vehicles at its introduction. Among design features, the vehicle featured front triangular quarter-windows, door-mounted side mirrors, a rear <b>liftgate</b> with top-mounted spoiler, and translucent front and rear light covers with round lenses. The exterior color scheme was two-tone, with the bumper and lower body-side cladding a gray color. The RX 300 carried a drag coefficient of 0.36 C'd. The first-generation Lexus RX was built in Kyushu, Japan.|$|E
500|$|The {{low-emission}} package standard {{available on}} later 2012 Volts {{destined for the}} California market {{is included in the}} 2013 Volts sold in New York state to allow their owners access to high-occupancy lanes. The <b>liftgate</b> and roof of the 2013 model is body-colored rather than black, and a new interior color [...] "Pebble Beige" [...] is available in both cloth upholstery and leather seats with suede inserts. A removable rear-seat center armrest is included in the premium trim package. Other changes include an improved audio system with GPS-based navigation; a comfort package that includes heated driver and front passenger cloth seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel; and there are a pair of available safety packages.|$|E
500|$|The Chevrolet Volt {{concept car}} debuted at the January 2007 North American International Auto Show, {{becoming}} the first-ever series plug-in hybrid concept car shown {{by a major}} car manufacturer. The Volt concept vehicle had four doors with a rear <b>liftgate</b> and seating for four passengers. This was {{a significant change in}} design when compared to the General Motors EV1 of the 1990s, which only seated two to reduce weight and to make the necessary room for the lead-acid battery pack. The top speed was also increased on the Volt, from the electronically limited [...] to [...] The battery pack size was reduced, from about [...] in volume in the EV1, to [...] in the Volt.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Pinto {{went on sale}} on September 11, 1970 in one bodystyle, a {{fastback}} sedan with {{trunk and}} metal trunklid. [...] A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model. Marketed as the Runabout, the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062. The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the <b>liftgate</b> and five decorative chrome strips, pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately {{as large as the}} sedan's, and a fold down seat — a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered [...] of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be replaced with a rear hatch that was entirely glass.|$|E
2500|$|For {{increased}} cargo capacity, {{a station}} wagon body style was offered from 1977. The wagon version was only five inches longer (127mm) and weighed only [...] more than the coupe. It was also a less unusual-looking design with a squared-off back and straight, almost upright, rear side windows. Although front vent windows were optional on all Pacers, the wagon's rear side glass featured vent windows as standard. [...] The broad and rear <b>liftgate</b> opened to a wide, flat cargo area with [...] of space, significantly easing the task of loading cargo. The rear seat also folded flat to form {{a continuation of the}} cargo floor. Some wagon models featured simulated woodgrain trim on the lower body sides and the <b>liftgate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{station wagon}} (also {{known as an}} estate or estate car) is an {{automobile}} with a body style variant of a sedan/saloon with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the <b>liftgate</b> or tailgate), instead of a trunk lid. [...] The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design—to include an A, B, and C-pillar, {{as well as a}} D-pillar. [...] Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced <b>liftgate</b> which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|E
2500|$|The Rally-based Spirit liftbacks were {{available}} in two sports versions, the standard [...] "Rally AMX" [...] and the high performance [...] "Rally GT" [...] in their first year. Both versions came standard with a Transmission Technologies Corporation (Tremec) 176-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, power brakes with front disks and rear drums, power steering, front and rear sway bars, heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, seven-bladed flexible cooling fan, tinted windshield, leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, tachometer, center console with armrest and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges plus rear ashtray, reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, split-back rear seat, three-point retractable seatbelts, woodgrain panels on dashboard, full light group (hood, courtesy, ashtray, glove box) except reading dome light, blacked-out dual remote-controlled mirrors and VAM-designed aluminum grille with a central [...] "Rally" [...] emblem. The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of fan shroud and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a clutch fan instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric <b>liftgate</b> lock release and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|E

50|$|Rear door: Hatchbacks {{typically}} {{feature a}} top-hinged <b>liftgate</b> for cargo access, with variations {{from a single}} <b>liftgate</b> to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk lid (e.g., the 2008 Škoda Superb's TwinDoor). Station wagons also have numerous tailgate configurations. Typically, a hatchback's hatch or <b>liftgate</b> does not extend down to the bumper, as on wagons. Another appearance variation that seems to blur the lines between a commonly defined hatchback versus a station wagon is called a kammback, which generally features a sloping roof {{towards the end of}} the vehicle, with an almost vertical rear section to the bumper.|$|E

5000|$|In early 2003, Toyota {{added an}} {{optional}} Appearance Package for the SR5 model that included color-keyed cladding, bumpers, and <b>liftgate</b> trim. In April 2003, Toyota made the Appearance Package, {{along with the}} previously optional fog lamps, running boards, and 16-inch aluminum wheels, standard on the SR5. The Sport Edition also added black running boards and color-keyed trim, replacing the grey cladding and silver-painted grille, door handles and <b>liftgate</b> trim.|$|E

50|$|The front fascias of the Chevy Suburban and GMC Yukon XL are distinct, {{but from}} the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now {{includes}} inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and <b>liftgate</b> panels are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that was located on the <b>liftgate</b> door is moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear <b>liftgate</b> window. Also noticeable is the SUV's length, which expands from 222.4 in to 224.4 in (the Yukon XL's length is shorter at 224.3 in) and its width from 79.1 in to 80.5 in, while the height decreases from 76.8 in to 74.4 in, thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a little bit wider, more streamlined, and roomier.|$|E
5000|$|Hatchback (a.k.a. liftback) sedans {{typically}} have the fastback profile, {{but instead of}} a trunk lid, the entire back of the vehicle lifts up (using a <b>liftgate</b> or hatch). A vehicle with four passenger doors and a <b>liftgate</b> at the rear can be called a four-door hatchback, five-door hatchback, four-door hatchback sedan, or five-door sedan. An example of such is the Chevrolet Malibu Maxx and Audi A5 Sportback. There can also be two-door hatchback sedans (three-door sedans), by the same technical explanation for two-door sedans. Examples of this design are the Ford Focus, Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Chevrolet Chevette and Daewoo Nexia(Opel Kadett E) ...|$|E
50|$|The 2005 {{model year}} saw the long-standard side-hinged panel doors {{discontinued}} {{in favor of}} the formerly optional <b>liftgate.</b> All engines switched to an all-electric cooling system to reduce power loss and fuel consumption.|$|E
