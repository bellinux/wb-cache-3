500|$|In {{the late}} 14th century, the rocket <b>launching</b> <b>tube</b> was {{combined}} with the fire lance. This involved three tubes attached to the same staff. As the first rocket tube was fired, a charge was ignited in the leading tube which expelled a blinding lachrymatory powder at the enemy, and finally the second rocket was fired. An illustration of this appears in the Huolongjing, and a description of its effectiveness in obfuscating {{the location of the}} rockets from the enemy is provided. The Huolongjing also describes and illustrates two kinds of mounted rocket launchers that fired multiple rockets. There was a cylindrical, basket-work rocket launcher called the [...] "Mr. Facing-both-ways rocket arrow firing basket", as well as an oblong-section, rectangular, box rocket launcher known as the [...] "divine rocket-arrow block". Rockets described in the Huolongjing were not all in the shape of standard fire arrows and some had artificial wings attached. An illustration shows that fins were used to increase aerodynamic stability for the flight path of the rocket, which according to Jiao Yu could rise hundreds of feet before landing at the designated enemy target.|$|E
2500|$|One {{offensive}} weapons upgrade in 1943 for the Bf 109G — {{and also}} used for the Fw 190A — was one that mounted the Werfer-Granate 21 heavy calibre rocket weapon system with one <b>launching</b> <b>tube</b> under each wing panel. The rockets, fitted with a massive 40.8kg (90lbs) warhead, were aimed via the standard Revi reflector sights, and were spin-stabilized in flight. In emergency, the tubes could be jettisoned via a small explosive charge. Intended as a [...] "stand-off" [...] weapon, fired {{from a distance of}} 1,200 meters and outside the effective range of the formations defensive guns, it was [...] employed against Allied bomber formations, the Wfr. Gr. 21 rocket was unofficially known as the BR 21 (Bordrakete 21cm) for the Bf 109G-5, G-6 and G-14. The weapons system received the designation of Rüstsatz VII on the G-10.|$|E
50|$|Some water rocket {{launchers}} use <b>launch</b> <b>tubes.</b> A <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> fits {{inside the}} nozzle of the rocket and extends upward toward the nose. The <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> is {{anchored to the}} ground. As the rocket begins accelerating upward, the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> blocks the nozzle, and very little water is ejected until the rocket leaves the <b>launch</b> <b>tube.</b> This allows almost perfectly efficient conversion of the potential energy in the compressed air to kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the rocket and water. The high efficiency during the initial phase of the launch is important, because rocket engines are least efficient at low speeds. A <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> therefore significantly increases the speed and height attained by the rocket. <b>Launch</b> <b>tubes</b> are most effective when used with long rockets, which can accommodate long <b>launch</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{features}} of container–type missile launch technology for multi-barrel rocket, combined with non-lethal weapons {{in the field of}} application, a new concept about the launching unit for anti-riot rockets, which was the integration of storing and launching non-lethal rockets, was proposed. The load bearing on the launcher was analyzed and engineering plastics were selected as <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> materials. Combined the computer aided design software Pro/Engineer with the finite analysis software ANSYS, the numerical simulation of the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> was created. To ensure the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> design according with the theoretical design requirements, the stress and displacement of the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> under the maximum load were analyzed in comparison.

50|$|An {{advantage}} of a hot-launch system is that the missile propels itself out of the launching cell using its own engine, which {{eliminates the need for}} a separate system to eject the missile from the <b>launching</b> <b>tube.</b> This potentially makes a hot-launch system relatively light, small, and economical to develop and produce, particularly when designed around smaller missiles. A potential disadvantage is that a malfunctioning missile could destroy the launch tube.|$|E

5000|$|Accuracy is {{increased}} by spinning the projectile. This is achieved for a bullet by being forced against spiral rifling grooves in the barrel. A rocket {{does not have}} enough initial energy to allow stabilization this way. Spin stabilization of the Gyrojet was provided by angling the four tiny rocket ports rather than by forcing the projectile through a rifled barrel. Combustion gases released within the barrel were vented through vent holes in it. Spin stabilization is limited in accuracy as a targeting technique by the accuracy with which one can point the <b>launching</b> <b>tube</b> and the accuracy with which the orientation of the projectile is constrained by the tube. The technique requires the shooter to have a line of sight to his target.|$|E

According {{to some of the}} publicized examples of GJB 5860-2006 requirement, there are 3 types of VLS that differs in length: 9 meter, 7 meter and 3.3 meter respectively (section 5.1.3), but the diameter is same for all, 850 mm maximum (section 6.1.2), with each <b>launching</b> <b>tube</b> filled with either dry air or nitrogen inside (section 6.1.4), and with higher internal pressure. (section 6.1.4). Similar to U.S. Navy's MK 41, a launching module includes 8 launching tubes (section 5.2.4), and each tube can house 1~4 missiles (section 5.2.4). Each launching model has a launching control unit (section 5.3.7), which can simultaneously launch up to 4 missiles of different kind (section 5.3.6). The launching control unit must have built-in test/diagnostic function (section 5.3.8). These publicized portions of GJB 5860-2006 are surprisingly similar to that of Mk 41 VLS, which prompt some Chinese internet sources to claim that there are potential future export of such system so that it has to comply to Mk 41 VLS, the most widely used VLS in the world.|$|E
