In episode [...] "Reset" [...] Owen agrees to go on a date with her, but dies {{at the end of the}} episode after being shot in the heart. When Owen is briefly revived by team leader Jack Harkness using a resurrection glove, Tosh says her goodbye to him by confessing that she has always loved him. Owen flatlines, only to revive again permanently, existing in a state resembling undeath. In the episode [...] "Fragments", the audience comes to understand how Toshiko came to work for Torchwood; Captain Jack rescued her from a UNIT detention centre where she was held after she was forced to build a sonic modulator for an unnamed terrorist organisation. In the show's second-season finale, [...] "Exit Wounds", Toshiko is shot and killed by Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), Jack Harkness's unstable younger brother. She dies within minutes of Owen, having been unable to save him from his own death when he becomes trapped in a nuclear power facility bunker flooding with radioactive material. In the moments before their deaths, Owen apologises to Toshiko for never having managed to bring their relationship to fruition. By initiating the final <b>log-off</b> procedure for her account on the Torchwood computer system, Ianto activates a pre recorded message from Toshiko, in which she thanks Jack for saving her. She tells him that she is grateful for the opportunity to work in Torchwood and that she hoped her contributions were valued. After being killed off, the character is mentioned in the two episodes of Doctor Who which follow [...] "Exit Wounds". In these episodes, Gwen (Eve Myles) and Ianto vow to keep fighting in Tosh and Owen's memory, and later discover a [...] "time lock" [...] designed by Tosh which protects the Hub from Dalek invasion.|$|E

With {{the increase in the}} number of Internet users and applications in e-commerce, education, and communications, users security has become an important HCI issue. Our preliminary studies show that providing sufficient information for users is not adequate in handling user-related security issues (such as privacy). More than a quarter of 27 cyber-café users surveyed sometimes do not <b>log-off</b> their email account before timeout. On such occasions, their email accounts are accessible to the next user that logs in immediately. In this paper, we explore security issues that are of concern to users, and approach to user-security oriented designs for multi-user systems.

The existing LDPC code simulation tools consume very long time in evaluating {{the performance of a}} specific code design. This is due to the intensive number of required computations. This problem is overcome by developing a parallel protocol to distribute the computations among processing nodes in a TCP/IP network. As indicated by experimental results, the proposed simulation platform is scalable with the number of processing nodes. Another practical advantage of the proposed system {{is that it does not}} need dedicated processors to run it; rather, it can utilize idle times of processing nodes in a network and work transparent to a node user.

Various security technologies have been developed, such as authentication, authorization, and auditing. However, once a user logs on, it is assumed that the system would be controlled by the same person. To address this flaw, we developed a demonstration system that uses facial recognition technology to periodically verify the identity of the user. If the authenticated user's face disappears, the system automatically performs a <b>log-off</b> or screen-lock operation. This paper presents our further efforts in developing image preprocessing algorithms and dealing with angled facial images. The objective is to improve the accuracy of facial recognition under uncontrolled conditions. To compare the results with others, the frontal pose subset of the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) database was used for the test.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{strategies}} for better utilizing the network capacity of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) {{when they are}} faced with stochastic and dynamic arrivals and departures of customers attempting to log-on or <b>log-off,</b> respectively. We propose a method in which, depending {{on the number of}} modems available, and the arrival and departure rates of different classes of customers, a decision is made whether to accept or reject a log-on request. The problem is formulated as a continuous time Markov Decision Process for which optimal policies can be readily derived using techniques such as value iteration. This decision maximizes the discounted value to ISPs while improving service levels for higher class customers. The methodology is similar to yield management techniques successfully used in airlines, hotels, etc. However, there are sufficient differences, such as no predefined time horizon or reservations, that make this model interesting to pursue and challenging. This work was completed in collaboration with one of the largest ISPs in Connecticut.

The pattern of results suggested the operation of a social facilitation effect, as highly skilled monitored participants keyed more entries than highly skilled nonmonitored par-ticipants. The opposite pattern was detected among low-skilled participants. No signs of social loafing were detected among group-monitored participants. Nonmonitored work-ers and members of cohesive groups felt the least stressed. The implications of these findings for organizations adopting EPM systems are discussed. Electronic performance monitoring (EPM) is one of many technological innovations employees face in today's workplace. Using network technology, EPM systems provide managers with access to their employees ' computer termi-nals and telephones, allowing managers to determine at any moment throughout the day the pace at which employees are working, their degree of accuracy, log-in and <b>log-off</b> times, and even the amount of time spent on bathroom breaks. The study presented in this article examines how productivity and subjective experiences are affected by EPM and how the social context within which monitoring occurs moderates that influence.

40|$|Heightened {{interest}} and increased accessibility to computer systems have presented new threats to computer security, {{particularly in the}} areas of unauthorized system access. To counter such threats, computer password systems are used due to ease of implementation and low cost. However, there is nothing to prohibit access to a system if an adversary has discovered a valid password. Passwords are therefore open to compromise without the knowledge of their disclosure. In addition, passwords are static identity verifiers implying the same person is assumed until <b>log-off.</b> ^ There is very limited evidence of studies done with respect to techniques which aid in dynamically discriminating among users to ascertain whether the user at the terminal is actually the verified and authorized user at login time. A new authentication model is developed which is based on the variability in individual human-computer interactions, and implements a technique for formally modeling and analytically evaluating human-computer interactions. It employs dynamic, continuous, unobtrusive verification throughout a user 2 ̆ 7 s login session. The model is used in conjunction with a system 2 ̆ 7 s existing password mechanism and is composed of individual user models, based on users 2 ̆ 7 personal cognitive characteristics and usage patterns.

However, the proliferation of cloud storage services has fuelled concerns over privacy and security (e. g., dissemination of malware and unauthorised access of private information). Together with the growing of StaaS proposals, cloud storage is attracting the attention of research, although cooperative storage cloud forensic is relatively underexplored as this is a fairly new concept.

Significant effort, regulations, and safeguards are in place to protect the systems used in the healthcare industry. Employee handling of security remains an area of vulnerability related to security protocols. The unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT) served as the model for this qualitative exploratory study with the purpose of understanding registered nurse (RN) perceptions and lived experiences related to IT security. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 participants from the Three Rivers Chapter American Association Critical Care Nurses. Transcribed data were analyzed with a priori codes aligned to the constructs of UTAUT and emergent themes. The emergent themes from the RNs 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences revealed perceptions of IT security mishandling, including walking away from the computer without <b>log-off,</b> and sharing of accounts through single sign on authenticated badges. Strategic planning for the organizational IT security may be strengthened due to the insight about the RNs 2 ̆ 7 workflow related to IT security. Understanding employee perceptions, expressed intentions, and self-reported behaviors to IT security allows for the ability as managers to apply that knowledge to IT security systems, access methods, and implement procedures that will provide for increased organizational IT security and increased patient confidence.

The petrophysical logs are used in both subsurface modelling and to optimise the well completion strategy, ensuring effective coal dewatering and desorption for gas production. At the moment, the industry common practice for data acquisition is to use open-hole wireline logging tools, which were developed primarily for {{the oil and gas}} industry. These tools are designed for higher pressure and temperature specifications compared to the reservoir conditions normally seen in coalbed methane (CBM), commonly called coal seam gas (CSG) in Australia. This results in heavier tools, larger logging trucks and increased manpower requirements than seen in mining logging operations. Arrow 2 ̆ 7 s CBM development projects in Queensland, Australia, are designed with a large number of wells (more than ∼ 1000 wells) that will need to be drilled and evaluated over the next ten years. At present, the cost of logging (direct wireline contractors and associated rig time cost) is forcing Arrow to choose between early data coverage (reducing project economics) versus restricted logging (increasing project risk). In order to resolve this issue, Arrow has embarked on a series of technology trials to investigate various cost effective formation evaluation solutions, while still ensuring data quality and operational safety. This paper will present the results of a comparison (<b>log-off)</b> of state-of-the-art mining stackable logging technology and conventional oil and gas logging technology.

In this paper, a web-based online examination system is developed to address these aforementioned drawbacks. The system is designed to facilitate the examination processes and manage challenges surrounding the conduct of examination, auto-submission, auto-marking and examination result report generation. The conceptual design including the Data Flow Diagram (DFD), the Use Cases and the Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the system developed is also presented. The programming tools used for the front-end development of the system are Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 integrated development environment while Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is used as the database backend.
