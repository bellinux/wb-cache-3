5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and <b>low-strength</b> surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E

The Director considered the harm serious enough to enforce a 6-month trial in which the sale of take-away alcohol was restricted. Under the restrictions, only <b>low-strength</b> beer could be sold at the take-away liquor store in Fitzroy Crossing. Full-strength beer, wine and spirits were only available for consumption during opening hours within licensed premises.|$|E

25|$|December 1808. Its new {{commander}} General Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado {{allowed his}} soldiers to rest but {{was forced to}} execute three soldiers. One, a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders. The remnant of the 1st Division was sent home to Valencia province to recruit, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Divisions were reorganized into four divisions including a Vanguard and a Reserve. Many <b>low-strength</b> line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two. Stragglers and reinforcements swelled the ranks. The soldiers' spirits rose when a brigade under General Conde de Alacha Lilli marched into camp, having escaped from Napoleon's armies. Hearing that the emperor had gone off to the north, Infantado decided to launch an offensive toward Madrid before his reorganization was completed.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{strengths}} of concrete {{are used for}} different purposes. [...] Very <b>low-strength</b> - [...] or less - [...] concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight. [...] Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced. [...] For most routine uses, [...] to [...] concrete is often used. [...] concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option. [...] Higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects. [...] Strengths above [...] are often used for specific building elements. [...] For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of [...] or more, to keep {{the size of the}} columns small. [...] Bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required. [...] Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads. Strengths as high as [...] have been used commercially for these reasons.|$|E

50|$|Aspdin {{called the}} product Portland cement because set mortar made from it resembled “the best Portland stone". Portland stone {{was the most}} prestigious {{building}} stone in use in England at the time. The patent clearly does not describe the product recognised as Portland cement today. The product was aimed at the market for stuccos and architectural pre-cast mouldings, for which a fast-setting, <b>low-strength</b> cement was required (see cement). It was fired at low temperature (below 1250 °C) and therefore contained no alite.|$|E
50|$|Die cutting is {{the process}} of using a die to shear webs of <b>low-strength</b> materials, such as rubber, fiber, foil, cloth, paper, {{corrugated}} fiberboard, paperboard, plastics, pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes, foam and sheet metal. In the metalworking and leather industries, the process is known as clicking and the machine may be referred to as a clicking machine. When a dinking die or dinking machine is used, the process is known as dinking. Commonly produced items using this process include gaskets, labels, corrugated boxes, and envelopes.|$|E

Rossby waves in the Earth's atmosphere are easy to observe as (usually 4-6) large-scale meanders of the jet stream. When these deviations become very pronounced, masses of cold or warm air detach, and become <b>low-strength</b> anticyclones and cyclones, respectively, and are responsible for day-to-day weather patterns at mid-latitudes. The action of Rossby waves partially explains why eastern continental edges, such as the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada, are colder than Western Europe at the same latitudes.|$|E

House, still unconvinced, demands Detective Tritter and Wilson leave his office. Eventually, Dr. Cuddy sides with Wilson and refuses House any Vicodin, forcing him to detox, and removes him from his team's case: a 15-year-old girl suffering from a collapsed lung and anemia.|$|E
50|$|Few of {{the reforms}} planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm {{civilian}} political guidance, with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.Secondly, declining funding worsened the progress. Finally, there was no firm consensus within the military about what reforms should be implemented. General Pavel Grachev, the first Russian Minister of Defence (1992-96), broadly advertised reforms, yet wished to preserve the old Soviet-style Army, {{with large numbers of}} <b>low-strength</b> formations and continued mass conscription.

5000|$|High impact {{polystyrene}} (HIPS) {{was discovered}} by Charles F. Fryling in 1961. HIPS is a low cost, plastic material that is easy to fabricate and often used for low strength structural applications when impact resistance, machinability, and low cost are required. Its major applications include machined prototypes, <b>low-strength</b> structural components, housings, and covers. In order to produce the graft polymer, polybutadiene (rubber) or any similar elastomeric polymer is dissolved in styrene and polymerized.

50|$|Non-{{hydraulic}} lime {{takes longer}} to set and is weaker than hydraulic lime, {{and should not}} be allowed to freeze before it is well set. Although the setting process can be slow, the drying time of a lime mortar must be regulated at a slow rate to ensure a good final set. A rapidly dried lime mortar will result in a <b>low-strength,</b> poor-quality final mortar often displaying shrinkage cracks. In practice, lime mortars are often protected from direct sunlight and wind with damp hessian sheeting or sprayed with water to control the drying rates. But it also has the quality of autogeneous healing (self healing) where some free lime dissolves in water and is redeposited in any tiny cracks which form.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheap and}} simple water {{aspirator}} {{is the most}} common type of aspirator. It is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee fitting attached to a tap and has a hose barb at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. While previously common for <b>low-strength</b> vacuums needed in chemistry benchwork, they use a lot of water, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for, i.e. solvent removal, they can violate environmental protection laws such as RCRA by mixing these potentially hazardous solvents into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.|$|E

50|$|Although {{most states}} have {{somewhat}} limited experience to date with flowable fill, nearly all {{states that have}} used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance {{with little or no}} problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance {{to the use of the}} material by contractors or engineers. Since flowable fill is normally a comparatively <b>low-strength</b> material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in flowable fill or controlled low strength material mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in flowable fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix flowability. Its relatively low dry unit weight (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{construction}} challenge {{involved the}} weather in the region. Wang Yong, chief director of the Hangzhou Bay Trans-Oceanic Bridge Construction Command Post, described the bridge as being built [...] "in the world's most complicated sea environment, {{with one of the}} three biggest tides on Earth, the effect of typhoons and the difficult content of the sea soil." [...] Erosion of materials and cracking and bubbling of any concrete components became a large problem. To combat bubbling and eventual holes, engineers used a cloth-covered template over the concrete. This would improve the color and density of the pieces, making them both more aesthetically pleasing and sturdier. To reduce cracking, engineers used <b>low-strength</b> early-stretching technology when constructing box girders. This technology involves casting (molding) the girder, or bridge panel, letting it harden for no more than three days, and then squeezing it before it reaches its full density. This gives the girder more room to stretch after the bridge is constructed, preventing cracks in the concrete over time.|$|E
50|$|Some modern {{semi-automatic}} pistols are {{double action}} only (DA or DAO); that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, striker, or firing pin, and additionally releases {{the same to}} fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires {{the same amount of}} pressure. The Kel-Tec P-32 {{is an example of a}} DAO action. DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols. A notable exception is Glock-brand pistols which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO. The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a <b>low-strength</b> sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter's accuracy (like models G34 and G35).|$|E
5000|$|Legal {{definition}} of a [...] "junk gun" [...] usually restricts the materials {{that can be used}} in the manufacture of the gun, targeting zinc castings, low melting points (usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit), powder metallurgy, and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. As nearly all guns made this way are chambered for low-pressure cartridges, such as [...]22 Long Rifle and [...]25 ACP, these techniques provide sufficient strength and desirable weight and cost savings. The <b>low-strength</b> materials and cheap construction result in poor durability and marginal accuracy at longer ranges, but as most of these guns are designed for use in self-defense, accuracy and durability are not primary design goals. Most guns targeted by the [...] "junk gun" [...] bans are made by a group of current or former manufacturers in the Los Angeles area, such as Bryco Arms, Jimenez Arms, Jennings Firearms, Raven Arms, and Phoenix Arms, collectively known as the [...] "Ring of Fire".|$|E
