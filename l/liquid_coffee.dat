50|$|Ponche crema is a Venezuelan and Trinidadian cream-based liqueur. Recipes vary {{depending}} on the region, but main ingredients typically include milk, eggs, sugar, rum, and other minor ingredients such as vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and lemon rind. A variant type is prepared with concentrated <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> or instant coffee powder. However, most references to the ponche crema name aim at a traditional commercial product, available since 1900, whose recipe and manufacturing process are kept secret. Ponche crema is a beverage traditionally served in Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago during Christmas time, much as eggnog is in the United States. It is usually served cold, in small cups, either as an aperitif or a pousse-café.|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} ways of preprocessing chemical sensor data are presented {{as a means to}} improve the interpretation and the classification ability of an electronic nose (EN). The practical problem at hand is the distinction between four commercial coffee blends - containing up to 12 types of coffees - all of which are to be consumed as Espresso. Coffee was sampled in three successive preparation phases: as beans, ground (powder) or liquid (the actual Espresso). In the case of beans, stress is put on the improved clusters visualization after the preprocessing and before the actual classification is performed. Different catalysed sensors and successive extractions were used to differentiate the response pattern towards the various coffees. The features which permitted the best samples' classification as judged from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plots were selected. To this end, an empirical search strategy inside the feature space is presented. Scores from PCA were subsequently utilized as inputs for a feed forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) with cross-validation resulting in 100 % correct classification with just two sensors. In the case of ground coffee, a (supervised) drift compensation algorithm was developed. It essentially consists of removing the first principal component (PC) for every cluster since this is seen to be given by the drift. An 87. 5 % classification performance was achieved. <b>Liquid</b> <b>coffee,</b> on the other hand, was not successfully classified, probably due to the difficulty in assuring reproducible sampling conditions.

50|$|Strength {{refers to}} the amount of {{dissolved}} coffee solids per unit of <b>coffee</b> <b>liquid</b> volume. An espresso, specifically a ristretto, is the strongest of coffee drinks, meaning that it takes the same amount of coffee solubles and dissolves it in significantly less water. For example, a 20% extraction of 15 grams of espresso in a double shot (60 mL) yields 3 grams per 60 mL, or 5% strength, which is 3-4&times; typical brewed coffee strength.|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of {{different}} spraying lances and spraying volumes {{on the control}} of Brevipalpus phoenicis in coffee crops. The mite Brevipalpus phoenicis is found on coffee plantations in Brazil since the 1950 's. Responsible for indirect losses due to its role as vector of a virus disease, this mite species often requires control measures, the most common based on mitecide spraying. It was evaluated the mortality of B. phoenicis due the coverage of spraying <b>liquid</b> applied on <b>coffee</b> plants, with two types of lances used in air assisted sprayers and four spraying. volumes. Treatments were applied with mitecide abamectin (Vertimec 18 CE (R) at 0. 4 L per hectare), in volumes of 250, 400, 550 and 700 L per hectare, with two types of lances for the nozzles. The control efficiency against B. phoenicis, deposition and coverage by spray <b>liquid</b> on <b>coffee</b> plants was evaluated. Experimental delineation was in randomized blocks, with eight treatments plus a check plot in four replications. The statistical analysis was carried in a factorial scheme 2 x 4 + 1. No {{significant differences in the}} number of mites were found between treatments. As regards spraying liquid deposition, it was observed an increment with increasing spraying volumes, with the plant tops showing the best deposition of spraying liquid. The duplication of the lances (nozzle branches) resulted in a significant increase in control efficiency for B. phoenicis compared with conventional branch and with check plot, without dependence of spraying volume...|$|R
40|$|The study aims {{to compare}} the {{efficiency}} of previously used <b>liquid</b> media for <b>coffee,</b> evaluating NAA concentrations in liquid medium and proline in semi-solid medium in the regeneration of somatic embryos and asses concentrations of BA and IAA in the maturation of embryos in temporary immersion bioreactors.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a double blind study in {{patients}} with senile dementia to determine if {{the quality and quantity of}} sleep could be changed with various amounts of caffeine. Twelve patients with dementia were studied in a nursing home setting. Patients were medication free for a month prior to the study. Four treatments were given in a double blind technique. These included an uncaffeinated <b>liquid</b> and <b>coffee</b> with various amounts of caffeine. Measurements checked included sleep induction time, quality of sleep, total length of sleep, time awake during the night, and a global rating. No significant dif-ferences were noted between the noncaffeinated placebo and the coffee containing various amounts of caffeine. HERE have been anecdotal reports A (personal communication from A. J. Moss, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Rochester) of a soporific effect of coffee or caffeine sodium benzoate in patients with dementia. We have re-cently completed a double blind controlled study in patients with senile dementia to deter-mine if the quality and quantity of sleep changed with varying amounts of caffeine in-take. METHODS Subjects. — Twelve patients were studied in a nursing home setting. They unequivocally fulfilled the criteria for dementia (APA DSM II) as demonstrated by disorientation to time and place, loss of both recent and past memory, inability to calculate, and scores on the SET (Isaacs & Akhtar, 1972; Isaacs & Kennie, 1973) test below 15.

40|$|We {{sought to}} prospectively study all {{injuries}} {{in children and}} adolescents up to 16 years of age presenting to a regional Emergency Department (ED), to ascertain detailed injury patterns and to use this data to recommend injury prevention priorities. Electronic injury surveillance was prospectively collected over a 10 year period (1997 - 2007) in a hospital with a paediatric catchment population of 75, 000 in a region with pockets of high social deprivation. All fatalities were obtained from data provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Over a 10 year period, there were 31 fatalities, 5, 408 admissions and 40, 817 new attendances due to injury. Males outnumbered females in a 3 : 2 ratio. Of all injuries 24, 317 (60 %) occurred at home. Peak injury presentation time was in the evening between 18 : 00 and 20 : 00. Minor injuries (bruises, minor head injuries, lacerations and sprains) accounted for 32, 456 (80 %) of total. Fractures resulting from high falls (n= 1, 194) tended to result from bunk beds, staircases, horses, walls and playground equipment. Burns (n= 630) involved hot <b>liquids</b> (tea, <b>coffee),</b> hot bath water, hot cooking oil and hot cooking plates. Pedestrian injuries (n= 251) were predominantly 'dart outs' in urban areas. Car passenger injuries (n= 869) showed low rates of documented car restraint use. Poisonings (n= 1, 153) were predominantly medicinal products. Cyclist injuries (n= 477) indicated low documented use of appropriate helmet wear. Prevention priorities should focus on home injuries, hot liquid burn and scald injuries and high falls from walls, beds and playground equipment. To prevent road-related injuries and deaths, further legislation, urban planning and greater police enforcement is required...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{awareness}} and ever-growing restrictive regulations over contamination {{have increased the}} need for more environmentally-friendly lubricants. Due to their superior biodegradability and lower toxicity, vegetable oils are a good alternative to replace currently-used mineral oils. However, vegetable oils show low oxidation and thermal stability and poor anti-wear properties. Most of these drawbacks can be attenuated through the use of additives. In the last decade, ionic liquids have emerged as high-performance fluids and lubricant additives due to their unique characteristics. In this study, the tribological behavior of two phosphonium-based ionic liquids is investigated as additives of coffee bean oil in steel-steel contact. <b>Coffee</b> bean oil-ionic <b>liquid</b> blends containing 1, 2. 5, and 5 wt% of each ionic liquid are studied using a block-on-flat reciprocating tribometer and the test results are compared to commercially-available, fully-formulated lubricant.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reference}} price on brand choice decisions {{has been well}} docu-mented in the literature. Researchers, however, have differed in their conceptual-izations and, therefore, in their modeiing of reference price. In this article, we evaluate five alternative models of reference price of which two are stimulus based (i. e., based on information available at the point-of-purchase) and three that are memory based (i. e., based on price history and/or other contextual fac-tors). We calibrate the models using scanner panel data for peanut butter, <b>liquid</b> detergent, ground <b>coffee,</b> and tissue. To account for heterogeneity in model parameters, we eniploy a latent class approach and select the best segmentation scheme for each model. The best model of reference price is then {{selected on the basis}} of fit and prediction, as well as on the basis of parsimony in cases where the fits of the models are not very different. In all four categories, we find that the best reference price model is a memory-based model, namely, one that is based on the brand's own price history. In the liquid detergent category, how-ever, we find that one of the stimulus-based models, namely, the current pric...|$|R
50|$|T&H Smith was {{established}} as a chemists at 21-23 Duke Street, Edinburgh in 1827, by Thomas Smith and his brother Henry. On 13 April 1839, just three months after Henry Fox Talbot had announced his photogenic drawing process, T&H Smith placed an advert in The Scotsman offering photographic paper and chemicals. In 1840, having bought Blandfields Chemicals in Canongate and moved into their premises, the company developed the first <b>liquid</b> essence of <b>coffee,</b> later supplemented by creating various carbonated beverage flavours. Having opened a London branch in 1848, in 1851 the company discovered Aloin. But the company fortunes were made from 1855, when the first Morphine injection was developed. T&H Smith was the first company to produce commercial quantities of Apomorphine, and then Diamorphine in 1887. In 1906 the company moved from Canongate to the suburban outskirts of Edinburgh at Gorgie. During World War I, the company supplied Morphine and over 7500 LT of Lint-based medical dressings to the British Army. In 1919, T&H Smith bought Glasgow Apothecaries. In 1926, the company acquired John Mackay Chemicals, subsequently incorporating its associated subsidiaries in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|R
