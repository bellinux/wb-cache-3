25|$|On 20 June Foy issued {{orders to}} {{evacuate}} Bilbao. On 21 June, {{the day of}} battle, Maucune's division set off at dawn from Vitoria, escorting a large convoy toward the French frontier. That evening Maucune told Foy at Bergara {{that he had heard}} the sound of cannon fire behind him. The next day, refugees appeared, telling of a disaster and warning that Allied troops were in pursuit. <b>Longa's</b> division left Vitoria at dawn on 22 June. Girón's tired troops left Vitoria in the afternoon but were soon halted when Clausel was discovered to the south. With only two battalions, Foy was able to slow <b>Longa's</b> advance at the cost of about 200 casualties. By 23 June, Foy collected about 3,000 soldiers at Bergara and with these he confronted <b>Longa's</b> division while waiting for the garrison of Bilbao and Vertigier Saint Paul's Italian brigade to reach him. The Army of Galicia arrived at noon, but since the soldiers were in a state of exhaustion, Girón planned to attack Foy the following day. As soon as the missing French units reached Bergara in the afternoon, Foy marched east to Villareal de Álava.|$|R

5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the {{addressee}} of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione <b>longa,</b> {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this never occurred.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia <b>longa</b> where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the roughtail stingray {{is not fully}} resolved, with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic, southwestern Atlantic, and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology, found that the roughtail stingray is the sister species to the broad stingray (D. lata), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. <b>longa).</b> The close relationship between the roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz and colleagues in 2006. The roughtail and broad stingrays {{are found in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively, and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma).|$|E

40|$|There {{are rare}} reports about {{isolated}} streptomyces {{associated with the}} rhizosphere of Rhizoma Curcumae <b>Longae.</b> In the present study, the cultural characteristics, phylogenetic analysis of the streptomyces strain Eri 12 isolated from the rhizosphere of Rhizoma Curcumae <b>Longae</b> and antioxidant activity of the ethyl acetate extract of mycelia of Eri 12 were investigated. The Strain Eri 12 was isolated from the rhizosphere of Rhizoma Curcumae <b>Longae</b> which was collected from Ya'an city of Sichuan province, southwest of China. The strain Eri 12 was subjected to molecular identification which included DNA extraction, amplification of 16 S rDNA, 16 S rDNA gene sequencing, BLASTN search and construction of 16 S rDNA phylogenetic tree using MEGA 4. 1. Simultaneously, the mycelia extract using ethyl acetate was tested for its antioxidant activity using ABTS (2, 2 -Azinobis- 3 -ethyl benzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) radicals scavenging test and DPPH [1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl] radicals scavenging test. Analysis of 16 S rDNA gene sequence demonstrated that the strains Eri 12 was most closely related to representatives of the genera Streptomyces. The ethyl acetate extract showed the antioxidant activity against the ABTS (2, 2 -Azinobis- 3 -ethyl benzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) free radicals and DPPH(1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl) free radicals with IC 50 (The half-inhibitory concentration) of 172. 4322. 19 and 842. 18161. 24 g mL - 1, respectively.

25|$|A {{syllable}} that {{is heavy}} because it {{ends in a}} long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called syllaba nātūrā <b>longa</b> ('syllable long by nature'), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called positióne <b>longa</b> ('long by position').

25|$|Anxious that Allied troops {{might use}} {{the road from}} Salvatierra to cut him off, Foy {{instructed}} Maucune to hold the road open until his 8,000 soldiers got past the danger point. Maucune sent the convoy ahead to Tolosa and turned back. He assigned one brigade to hold Villafranca de Ordicia and the second brigade to defend Beasain. Foy's column left Villareal de Álava in the predawn hours of 24 June with Saint Paul's brigade acting as the rearguard. <b>Longa's</b> troops {{caught up with the}} Italians but were unable to slow them down.

25|$|As {{with the}} notes, {{the shapes of}} the rest symbols in mensural {{notation}} are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced {{in the course of the}} period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the <b>longa</b> rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the <b>longa</b> was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three <b>longa</b> rests combined. If several <b>longa</b> rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.|$|E
