In restoring order and justice, everything like retaliation ought to be religiously avoided; and an example ought to be set of a total alienation from the Jacobin proceedings in their accursed revolutionary tribunals. Everything like <b>lumping</b> <b>men</b> in masses, and of forming tables of proscription, ought to be avoided.|$|R

60|$|I beseech you ponder with yourselves your eternal condition, and {{see what}} title, what ground and {{foundation}} you have for your Christianity: if more than a profession, and an historical belief of the gospel. Have you known the baptism of fire, and the Holy Ghost, and the fan of Christ that winnows away the chaff in your minds, the carnal lusts, and affections; that divine leaven of the kingdom, that, being received, leavens the whole <b>lump</b> of <b>man,</b> sanctifying him throughout in body, soul, and spirit? If this be not the ground of your confidence, {{you are in a}} miserable state.|$|R
60|$|That Sunday evening, {{sitting in}} baggy canvas lawn-chairs beside the house, the Kennicotts saw Fern {{laughing}} with Cy Bogart who, though still {{a junior in}} high school, was now a <b>lump</b> of a <b>man,</b> {{only two or three}} years younger than Fern. Cy had to go downtown for weighty matters connected with the pool-parlor. Fern drooped on the Bogart porch, her chin in her hands.|$|R

50|$|Subsequently an {{alternative}} approach was suggested combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology and biogeography. This supported Manning et al.s Clade C within which Ornithogalum was contained, but the very large subgenus Ornithogalum was noted to still be heterogeneous, an issue which those authors had managed by treating the subgenus in seven sections. In contrast Martinez-Azorin et al. suggested reversing the sensu lato (<b>lumping)</b> approach of <b>Manning</b> et al., reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting Galtonia and eighteen other genera.|$|R

50|$|Further {{analysis}} with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) {{and a third}} plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/Ornithogalum. Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, Ornithogalum corresponding to clade C, placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into subgenera and sections, with 160 species. Galtonia was retained as a taxon, but at the subgenus level. An alternative approach was suggested by combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology, and biogeography. This supported Manning's clade C within which Ornithogalum was contained, but the very large subgenus Ornithogalum was noted to still be heterogeneous, which they had managed by treating it as seven sections. This study suggested reversing the sensu lato (<b>lumping)</b> approach of <b>Manning</b> et al., reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting Galtonia.|$|R
60|$|I {{am aware}} that in saying this I take {{my life in}} my hands. I shall be {{prepared}} to defend myself from the infuriated Westerner with the usual argument, which I shall carry about loaded in all its chambers in my right-hand pocket. I am also aware that less infuriated Easterners, choosing their own more familiar weapon, will inundate my leisure with sardonic inquiries whether I don't consider Oliver Wendell Holmes or Charles Eliot Norton (thus named in full) the equal in culture of the average American woman. Well, I frankly admit these cases and thousands like them; indeed I have {{had the good fortune}} to number among my personal acquaintances many American gentlemen whose chivalrous breeding would have been conspicuous (if you will believe it) even at Marlborough House. I will also allow that in New York, in Boston, and less abundantly in other big towns of America, men of leisure, men of culture, and men of thought are to be found, as wide-minded and as gentle-natured as this race of ours makes them. But that doesn't alter the general fact that, taking them in the <b>lump,</b> American <b>men</b> stand a step or two lower in the scale of humanity than American women. One need hardly ask why. It is because the men are almost all immersed and absorbed in business, while the women are fine ladies who stop at home, and read, and see, and interest themselves widely in numberless directions.|$|R
40|$|If we were {{to regard}} E. H. ’s public persona {{from the point of}} view of Venezuela’s {{prevalent}} official discourses and practices of exclusion, he would no doubt belong to the brand of dangerous barrio (shantytown) youngsters and grown-up <b>men</b> <b>lumped</b> under the label of malandros (thugs). As an ordinary inhabitant of the shantytowns of Caracas, E. H. personifies in his very flesh and personal style the suspicious appearance named by Julio de Freitas (1995 : 3 - 4) as typical of the streets of Venezuela’s capital city. E. H. is an ordinary tierrúo who, once out of his immediate urban territory, his shantytown, frequently notices that others cross the street to avoid him, that merchants lock their shops upon spotting him, that police officers comment on how he does not fit in and that they may reach for their guns or harass him, that taxi drivers speed away while refusing him a ride.
