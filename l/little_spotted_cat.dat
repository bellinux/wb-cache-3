25|$|The oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} tiger cat, <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cat,</b> and tigrillo, is a small spotted cat ranging from Central America up to central Brazil. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the population is threatened by deforestation and conversion of habitat to agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Most big cats in Costa Rica are nocturnal or hide {{in trees}} in the {{rainforest}} like the margay. The most likely place to find a big cat is in the Simon Bolivar Zoo in San José, Costa Rica {{where there is a}} selection of all the native big cats along with other animals. Ocelots usually hunt on the ground at night and rarely climb trees. An ocelot's diet consists of birds, monkeys, rats, and other small animals. The <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cat</b> is the smallest wild cat and does not grow bigger than a house cat. They live in cloud forests up to 3200 m.|$|E
50|$|The Tumbes Region is the {{smallest}} in Peru and also the northernmost. It is near the border with Ecuador. Despite its size, {{it is home to}} extremely varied terrain which attracts equally varied tourists. The coast of the department is defined by white sand beaches such as Punta Sal and Zorritos. The protected areas of Amotape Hills National Park, Tumbes National Reserve, and the Tumbes Mangals National Sanctuary are all visited by tourists worldwide. The Amotape Hills National Park is home wildlife such as the Andean condor, the <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cat,</b> the red deer, the peccary, the northern anteater, the spectacled bear, the grey deer, and the Guayaquil squirrel. The mangroves forests are home to birds such as black hawks, egrets, and other types of birds. The swamps contain American crocodile farms, a species nearing extinction. The department's cuisine is exquisite and uses local resources such as black scallops and crabs. More than 50% of the land area of this department is in national parks.|$|E
50|$|Wild cats {{that exist}} in Costa Rica are: jaguars, ocelots, pumas, jaguarundi, margays, and <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stifle joints of <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats</b> in captivity using radiographic and CT studies. The hypothesis was that these animals would have meniscal mineralisation that could be detectable by imaging studies. Twelve intact <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats</b> (Leopardus tigrinus), 2 females and 10 males, aged from 1. 5 to 11. 11 years old and weighing 1. 9 - 3. 05 kg were studied. These animals, which were living in the Quinzinho de Barros Municipal Zoo, had no symptoms or known disease processes at the time of the study. The plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of both stifle joints were performed under general anaesthesia. Sequential transverse images were acquired on a spiral scanner. Results: No signs of articular disease were observed in any of the animals. Radiographically, the meniscal mineralisation was detected as an oval radiopacity in the cranial compartment on the mediolateral projection, located within the area of the medial meniscus. On craniocaudal projection, the mineralisation was more difficult to visualise. In one of the animals, it was not possible to identify the meniscal mineralisation in either of the stifle joints. Using CT, meniscal mineralisation was best identified in the transverse plane images. Conclusions: Meniscal mineralisation appears to be a normal anatomic feature in <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats.</b> © 2013 Rahal et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{samples from}} 18 pumas (Puma concolor), one ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and two <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats</b> (Leopardus tigrinus) {{collected}} from free-ranging animals in Brazil between 1998 and 2004 were tested by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) for antibodies to feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV 1), calicivirus (FCV), coronavirus (FCoV), parvo-virus (FPV), Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma pha-gocytophilum, and Bartonella henselae. Serum samples also were tested, by Western blot and ELISA, for {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) specific antibodies and antigen, respectively, by Western blot for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and by indirect ELISA for antibodies to puma lentivirus (PLV). Antibodies to FHV 1, FCV, FCoV, FPV, FeLV, FIV, PLV or related viruses, and to B. henselae were detected.

40|$|Hemotropic mycoplasmas, epicellular {{erythrocytic}} bacterial parasites {{lacking a}} cell wall, are the causative agents of infectious anemia in numerous mammalian species. The presence of hemotropic mycoplasmas in blood samples of neotropical and exotic wild canids and felids from Brazilian zoos were recorded using molecular techniques. Blood {{samples were collected}} from 146 Brazilian wild felids, 19 exotic felids, 3 European wolves (Canis lupus), and from 97 Brazilian wild canids from zoos in the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso and the Federal District. Using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), this work found 22 (13 %) wild felids positive to Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum [4 jaguars (Panthera onca); 3 pumas (Puma concolor); 10 ocelots (Leopardus pardalis); 2 jaguarondis (Puma yagouaroundi); and 3 little spotted cats (Leopardus tigrinus) ]. Only one <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus tigrinus) was positive to Mycoplasma haemofelis, and none was positive to Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis. Two bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) were positive for a Mycoplasma sp. closely related to Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum, and two European wolves were positive for a Mycoplasma sp. closely related to candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum. This is the first study regarding the molecular detection of hemotropic mycoplasmas in wild canids.

50|$|The Huánuco Region {{is divided}} into two {{distinct}} geographical regions, the sierra and the jungle. The capital city, also known as Huánuco is in the Andean sierra. It was founded in 1539 by the Spanish and ever since it has been a site of colonial architecture typical of the Peruvian Andes. On {{the opposite side of the}} department, in the jungle area, is Tingo María, the department's second largest city. It is home to the Tingo Maria National Park which contains a variety of flora such as orchids, cat's claw, and dragon's blood, as well as animals such as <b>little</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>cats,</b> jaguars, reptiles, sachavacas, oilbirds, Andean cock-of-the-rock, and the howler monkey. A tourist destination in this area is the Owl's Cave, home to nocturnal birds and the Turkey's Cave, home to abundant vegetation.|$|R
