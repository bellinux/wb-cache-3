5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States {{in order to}} evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{the breakdown of}} his marriage, Afroyim {{decided to return to}} the United States, but the State Department refused to renew his U.S. passport, ruling that because Afroyim had voted in the 1951 Israeli legislative election, he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. A letter certifying Afroyim's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on January 13, 1961.|$|E

5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Swiss citizenship, {{according}} to article 37, is legally {{a consequence of}} cantonal and municipal citizenship, reflecting the three-tiered setup of the Swiss state. Nonetheless, federal law regulates the general rules of acquisition and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> as set forth in article 38. The exact procedure of acquiring citizenship is governed by cantonal law. Some cantons have instituted administrative bodies to process petitions for citizenship, while in others, prospective citizens are vetted, and their petitions voted on, by a municipal citizens' assembly. These procedures are a subject of perennial political controversy between advocates of {{a more or less}} strict immigration policy.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Knežević {{remained}} in exile and was tried in absentia alongside others. He {{was found guilty}} of treason and war crimes and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour, loss of political and civic rights for 5 years, confiscation of all property, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The sentence of imprisonment with hard labour was to commence from the date of his future arrest. He emigrated to Canada where he was the editor of Glas kanadskih Srba (Voice of the Canadian Serbs). In the early 1950s, an acrimonious dispute arose between Cvetković and Knežević. Knežević wrote an article in the international relations journal International Affairs claiming that Prince Paul and Cvetković had formulated a secret plan to ally Yugoslavia with Germany and to gain control of the port of Salonika while Greece was defending against the Italian invasion. While Cvetković issued two strong denials in the historical journal Dokumenti o Jugoslaviji, and stated that seizing Salonika had never been on the agenda of the Yugoslav government, his latter statement was not true. The main purpose of Knežević's allegation was to discredit Prince Paul and portray the coup plotters in a favourable light. Knežević died in Toronto on 22 June 1983.|$|E

500|$|In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren {{argued that}} [...] "Citizenship is man's basic right, {{for it is}} nothing less than the right to have rights" [...] and that [...] "a {{government}} of the people cannot take away their citizenship simply because one branch of that government can be said to have a conceivably rational basis for wanting to do so." [...] While Warren was willing to allow for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> as a result of foreign naturalization or other actions [...] "by which [...] manifests allegiance to a foreign state [...] may be so inconsistent with the retention of [...] citizenship as to result in loss of that status", he wrote that [...] "In specifying that any act of voting in a foreign political election results in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship,</b> Congress has employed a classification so broad that it encompasses conduct that fails to show a voluntary abandonment of American citizenship." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in 2005, which sought, among other things, to force the State Department to abolish the above policy on <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> and reinstate its pre-1990 policy [...] "of viewing dual/multiple citizenship as problematic and as something to be discouraged, not encouraged."

500|$|The minority—in a dissent {{written by}} Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II and joined by Associate Justices Tom C.

500|$|Afroyim's counsel had {{addressed}} {{only the}} foreign voting question and had carefully avoided any direct {{challenge to the}} idea that foreign naturalization might legitimately lead to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> (a concept which Warren had been willing to accept in his Perez dissent). [...] Nevertheless, the Court's Afroyim ruling went beyond even Warren's earlier position—holding instead that [...] "The very nature of our government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1967 Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Afroyim v. Rusk, US law had {{provided}} for numerous ways for citizens {{to lose their}} citizenship. In its Afroyim ruling, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment barred Congress from revoking anyone's citizenship without their consent. Specifically, {{the court held that}} a law automatically revoking the citizenship of anyone who had voted in a foreign election was unconstitutional and unenforceable. [...] However, US law continued, after Afroyim to list several other [...] "expatriating acts," [...] the voluntary performance of any of which would result in automatic <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship.</b>|$|E

500|$|Before {{heading the}} ACLU, Ennis {{had served as}} {{general counsel for the}} INS. [...] In his oral {{argument}} supporting Afroyim, Ennis asserted that Congress lacked the power to prescribe forfeiture of citizenship, and he sharply criticized the foreign-relations argument under which the Perez court had upheld <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> for voting in a foreign election—pointing out, for example, that when a referendum was held in 1935 on the status of the Saar (a region of Germany occupied after World War I by the United Kingdom and France), Americans had participated in the voting without raising any concerns within the State Department at the time.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{affirmation}} by Congress, in the Expatriation Act of 1868, that individuals had an inherent right to expatriation (giving up of citizenship), it {{has historically been}} accepted that certain actions could result in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship.</b> This possibility was noted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, an 1898 case involving a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were legally domiciled in the country.

500|$|Two Supreme Court {{decisions}} after Perez {{called into}} question the principle that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>citizenship</b> could occur even without the affected individual's intent.

[...] Associate Justice William J. Brennan (who had been in the majority in Perez) wrote a separate opinion concurring with the majority in Mendoza-Martinez and expressing reservations about Perez. [...] In Schneider v. Rusk (1964), where the Court invalidated a provision revoking the citizenship of naturalized citizens who returned to live permanently in their countries of origin, Brennan recused himself and did not participate in the decision of the case.|$|E
