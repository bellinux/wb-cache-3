50|$|With the {{promotion}} of alternative fuels, concerns arise regarding {{their impact on the}} environment. To address these concerns Title II makes a number of specific changes to existing policies. Changes include the extension of EPAs authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to control engines, vehicles, fuels, and fuel additives to include effects on water pollution. Additionally, the EPA administrator is to study adverse effects on air quality resulting from the expansion of the RFS and to promulgate regulations to mitigate said effects.Another area of particular interest is greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy consumption during production and use of alternative fuels. As such, EISA Title II requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to expand biological research and development program to include environmental effects, GHG reduction potential, and sustainable agriculture potential. > Furthermore, The Secretary of Energy is to develop tools for evaluating <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and GHG emissions from biofuels.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recognized}} that much {{energy is lost}} {{in the production of}} energy commodities themselves, such as nuclear energy, photovoltaicelectricity or high-quality petroleum products. Net energy content is the energy content of the product minus energy input usedduring extraction and conversion, directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturingsolar cells requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell [...] The result was refuted.Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is Energy Cannibalism. Energy Cannibalism refers to an effect where rapidgrowth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for energy that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing powerplants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the embodied energy offuture power plants.

50|$|Metals {{and their}} {{compounds}} {{have been used}} for millennia because of their unique properties. They are used in highly valued products of modern technology, furthermore, they plan an essential role in renewable energy technologies. After having analyzed issues of metal stocks in society and recycling rates and recycling conditions and opportunities in the previous two reports on metals, Metal Stocks in Society report and Recycling Rates of Metals report, the International Resource Panel decides to address the environmental and energy issues related to the use and the production of metals. In this report, an assessment is made of literature on metal flows and cycles in nature and in society, the way they are connected, and the potential impacted related to them. The four areas of focus are 1) Local impacts of mining, 2) <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> use, 3) non-metal sources, and 4) the need for a final sink. Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development.|$|E

40|$|A {{holistic}} approach to low-energy building design is essential to ensure that any efficiency improvement strategies provide a net energy benefit {{over the life of}} the building. Previous work by the authors has established a model for informing low-energy building design based on a comparison of the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand associated with a broad range of building assemblies. This model ranks assemblies based on their combined initial and recurrent embodied energy and operational energy demand. The current study applies this model to an actual residential building in order to demonstrate the application of the model for optimising a building’s <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how the availability of comparable energy performance information at the building design stage can be used to better optimise a building’s energy performance. The <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand of the case study building, located in the temperate climate of Melbourne, Australia, was quantified using a comprehensive embodied energy assessment technique and TRNSYS thermal energy simulation software. The building was then modelled with variations to its external assemblies in an attempt to optimise its <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance. The alternative assemblies chosen were those shown through the author’s previous modelling to result in the lowest <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand for each building element. The best performing assemblies for each of the main external building elements were then combined into a best-case scenario to quantify the potential <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> savings possible compared to the original building. The study showed that significant <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> savings are possible through the modelling of individual building elements for the case study building. While these findings relate to a very specific case, this study demonstrates the application of a model for optimising building <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance that may be applied more broadly during early-stage building design to optimise <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance...|$|E
40|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} for significant energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, globally. <b>Life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> analysis if often {{used to assess the}} total energy use of buildings and identify relevant reduction measures. However, most existing studies underestimate embodied energy, do not consider the occupant’s transport-related energy and focus on a single country. This study relies on a comprehensive <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> analysis framework to assess three different dwellings in Australia, Belgium and Lebanon. Results show that the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> profile varies significantly depending on the location and is influenced by a range of factors. This study shows that the proposed method can be applied in different contexts as long as the required data is available. By relying on a comprehensive <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> analysis framework, building designers can prioritise the most effective measures to reduce energy use and ultimately the environmental impact of buildingsinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Most {{zero-energy}} concepts {{focus on}} a reduction of the non-renewable operational energy use in buildings rather than taking the reduction of their <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> use as a starting point. Nevertheless, the life cycle embodied and end-of-life energy will become more important, especially in buildings with low operational energy. Therefore, the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> use of a Belgian zero-energy reference house is examined by means of <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> assessment. The influence of design decisions and regulations on the building construction type, the building services, {{and the performance of}} the building envelope are investigated. In terms of thermal performance of the building, the results show that the life cycle embodied energy in zero-energy houses with passive or standard thermal performance was not substantially different. From a <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> perspective, passive house requirements are not essential criteria for zero-energy houses in Belgium. On the other hand, large <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> savings were obtained through a proficient selection of all building construction materials and services. For the life cycle embodied energy in building constructions, the best timber frame and masonry houses were equally efficient.

Results and Conclusion Results show that the two assessment approaches for non-energetic resource utilisation lead to qualitatively equal results. Nevertheless they differ considerably {{from each other in}} their absolute values. This makes obvious that there is still a need for further methodological research work on that issue. Nevertheless, both methodologies yield that the accumulated effect of ore and mineral use is considerably lower than the accumulated effect of fossil primary energy utilisation in all <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> analysed.
