30|$|In 2010, the Madras High Court {{declared}} the Noyyal river unfit {{for human consumption}} as per the reports of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). In India, one-fifth of the exports are from the textile industries in Coimbatore and Tirupur areas. The untreated sewage and industrial effluents containing bleaching <b>liquids,</b> <b>soda</b> ash, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium peroxide, chemicals and various dyes are drain into the Noyyal River (The Hindu, 16 th January 2012). Recently, Water Resource Organisation (WRO) of the Public Works Department laboured to rejuvenate the Noyyal system at Rs. 180 crores aided by World Bank in 2013 (The Hindu, 15 th August 2013). All these necessitate the treatment of industrial effluents.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Zircon sand was {{reacted with}} <b>liquid</b> caustic <b>soda</b> (50 % NaOH) in open vessel at 600 o C for 2 h. The effect of NaOH/ZrSiO 4 {{reactant}} ratio on the yield of zirconia recovery was verified. Samples of fusion products water washed {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the main compounds formed. Silica powders were obtained via acid catalyzed reaction and zirconia powders were resulted from crystallization of zirconium oxychoride. Both zirconia and silica powders were analyzed by XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and BET method. Laser Quasi Elastic Light Scattering (QLS) technique was used for agglomerate size distribution determination. High purity and fine zirconia and silica powders were obtained. The specific surface area of zirconia calcined a...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 a {{shows the}} results of {{viscosity}} measurements of the substrate, which is a two-phase suspension mixture of cake syrup (<b>liquid)</b> and baking <b>soda.</b> The viscosity measurements were taken at constant shear rates (1.3 s^- 1 and 11 s^- 1) using a cone-plate-type rheometer (Bohlin CVO, Malvern Instruments) at 25 ^∘C. The viscosity gradually increases with the mass (i.e., concentration) of the baking soda for masses up to 15 g and then greatly increases for masses above 20 g (Fig.  4 a). Although {{the growth rate of}} the disturbance by RTI (τ) varies with baking soda concentration, all growth rates are on the order of 1 s and sufficiently smaller than the cooling rate (τ _cool; Additional file 1 : Table S 2).|$|R
40|$|Issue: Glass {{container}} {{manufacturers are}} using increasing quantities of recycled {{glass in the}} manufacture of new containers. Increasing percentages of recycled glass bring increasing amounts of contaminants. Ceramic contaminants in recycled glass include fragments of dishware (saucers, cups) cookware (Visionware, Pyrex), mirror glass, window glass, as well as bricks, rock, and concrete. Ceramic contaminants are more difficult to detect and remove than ferrous or non-ferrous metals or organics because they cannot be detected electro-magnetically. This best practice details the protocol and limitations of the methods for ceramic removal. Best Practice: Although small chips of many ceramic contaminants will actually melt with the glass at glass furnace temperatures, ceramic contaminants larger than No. 12 mesh do not melt during the standard furnace cycle (1 to 1. 5 days), resulting in inclusions in finished glass products. These inclusions can lead to eventual breakage of the glass product, especially if the product is filled with a pressurized <b>liquid</b> like <b>soda</b> or beer. To avoid these impurities, the cullet supply can be fine-sized to No. 12 mesh or smaller (See the Fine-sizing of Recycled Glass Best Practice), or the ceramic contaminants can be physically removed, or both. The methods of ceramic removal include source reduction, manual sorting, and automated ceramic removal...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Ceramic {{contaminants}} in recycled glass cullet {{can result in}} inclusions in finished glass products. Ceramic inclusions can lead to eventual fracturing or breakage of the glass container, especially if the container is filled with a pressurized <b>liquid</b> like <b>soda</b> or beer. Providing a cullet supply free of ceramic contaminants is generally {{the responsibility of the}} materials recovery facility (MRF). Many MRFs physically remove ceramic contaminants from the cullet, either manually or with automated systems. An alternative to complete ceramic removal is to reduce the entire cullet supply to No. 12 mesh or smaller. Called “fine-sizing”, this size reduction enables most ceramics to melt in the furnace. This Best Practice describes some prevalent technologies for fine-sizing cullet. Best Practice: This best practice considers two approaches to fine-sizing glass cullet: vertical shaft grinding and flexible impact pulverizing. Moisture control is also discussed. For more information on ceramic removal and moisture considerations, refer to the Best Practices Removal of Ceramics from Recycled Glass and Moisture Considerations in Processing and Distribution of Glass Cullet. Vertical Shaft Impact Grinders A vertical shaft grinder (VSG) uses a multiport, cullet lined rotor to finesize cullet through autogenic particle-to-particle attrition. A steady stream of cullet is fed into the top of a VSG system and accelerated through a turning rotor. The accelerated cullet stream is discharged into...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{direction in}} solving {{of environmental problems}} of soda industry {{is the development of}} low-waste resource-saving technologies, which consist in recycling of valuable waste components with obtaining the commercial products. Aim: The aim is to establish the optimal conditions for obtaining calcium carbonate with prescribed properties from <b>liquid</b> waste of <b>soda</b> production. Materials and Methods: Chemically deposited calcium carbonate is used as filler and should have certain physical and chemical properties. To obtain a product of prescribed quality the process of calcium carbonate deposition was performed of still waste liquid, that is the waste of calcium carbonate production and contain significant amount of calcium ions, and excessive production of the purified stock solution of sodium bicarbonate, which is composed of carbonate and hydrocarbonate ions. Results: The dependence of bulk density and specific surface area of calcium carbonate sediments and degree of deposition from such technological parameters are established: method of mixing the stock solutions, the concentration and molar ratio of reactants, temperature and reaction time. Conclusions: The optimal mode of deposition process is determined and the concept of production of calcium carbonate is developed. The quality of calcium carbonate meets the modern requirements of high dispersion, low bulk density and evolved specific surface of the product...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSlipping, {{tripping}} {{and falling}} which causes serious damages and losses happen {{all the time}} within household and work areas. According the formula of squeeze film, when the floor is contaminated with liquid, the higher the liquid viscosity the longer time to connect shoes with floor, the higher the risk of falling. The appropriate roughness of floor surface could be effective to improve the squeeze film effect caused by liquid while the floor is contaminated by liquid or oil. In kitchens, oil, sauces and liquid with higher viscosity are easily spread on floor. Therefore, this study discussed the influences of liquid viscosity and floor roughness upon slip-resistance effect adopting two shoe materials, six liquid with different viscosity and six floors with different roughness. The results demonstrate that the higher the liquid viscosity the lower the coefficient of friction. No matter how rough the floor is, the coefficient of friction approaches zero while the viscosity larger than 38 mPa. s. With the <b>liquid</b> (water or <b>soda)</b> viscosities were lower than 2 mPa. s, the slip resistant effect only shown as the floor roughness (Ra) was larger than 28 μm and Rtm was greater than 145 μm. The slip resistant effect shown as the floor roughness (Ra) must be much greater than 40 μm and Rtm must be much higher than 185 μm while the floor contaminated by liquid with viscosities higher than 2 mPa. s. Therefore, the best strategy to prevent slips/falls should be keeping the floor dry all the time...|$|R
