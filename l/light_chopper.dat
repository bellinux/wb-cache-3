5000|$|A {{class of}} {{laboratory}} power meters has an extended sensitivity, {{of the order}} of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical <b>light</b> <b>chopper</b> at typically 270 Hz, so the meter actually measures AC light. This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or [...] "lock-in") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with singlemode fiber. Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ultraviolet {{light can}} be used to stimulate {{electrical}} current flow in bone and tendon. This stimulated photocurrent is directional. In tendon the photocurrent parallel to the fibrils is greater than the photocurrent perpendicular to the fibrils. In bone, the longitudinal photocurrent is less than the transverse photocurrent. Many insulators yield small photocurrents under proper photon excitation (1). These photocurrents may be used as probes of the electronic structure of the insulator (2).

Axial velocity profiles were obtained at six locations axially along the channel centerline and nine locations radially across the thruster channel at the exit plane.

It was only when E-2/5 and D-1/7 came under attack that Lt. Col. Mallett C. Jackson Jr. and his S-3 Operations Officer, Major Richard Esau who were together in a fighting hole {{in the middle of this}} attack when word came over the command radio, that the pressure had been taken off the pinned down companies of the 5th Marines. Delta Company 1/7 had taken many casualties and their 2nd Platoon Commander, Lt. David Harris radioed requests for med-i-vac choppers, but all requests were denied because of the extreme darkness. In desperation, Lt. Harris repeatedly called out several SOS's and MAYDAY's for an emergency med-i-vac on the radio. Quickly the voice of Capt. N.J.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{fluorescence}} anisotropy spectrophotometer {{known by}} the acronym GUS has been in use at Oregon State University {{in the department of}} biochemistry and biophysics for several years under the supervision of Dr. Irvin Isenberg.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Improvements {{have been made in the}} Integrating Cavity Absorption Meter (ICAM). The ICAM is used to measure very small optical absorption coefficients (0. 001 m??), virtually independent of scattering effects. Optical absorption is measured by employing isotropic, homogeneous illumination of the sample; this eliminates the scattering problems associated with measuring the optical absorption of pure water. We optimize the early versions of the ICAM to enhance stability, sensitivity, and operational wavelength regions. The main part of this research work involves a complete reassembling of the optical components, innovations in the data acquisition/LabVIEW software, and instrument reconstruction associated with the new signal acquisition procedures. The integrating cavity assembly consists of two concentric and coaxial integrating cavities, that is, an integrating cavity within an integrating cavity. We use optical fibers to sample the irradiances in the inner cavity and outer cavity. And we use an extremely compact two-window double-channel <b>light</b> <b>chopper</b> to separate the signals proportional to the illumination in the two cavities. The negligible effects of elastic scattering result from the fact that this scattering does not remove any energy from the cavity combined with our uses of isotropic illumination. The latter is achieved by employing a high reflectivity (greater than 0. 99) lambertian material to build the integrating cavity.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} intersubband transitions in quantum well structures. The I-V characteristics, infrared absorption spectra, and photoresponse spectra of superlattices are used to characterize multiple quantum well structure properties in unipolar devices. An important numerical method for solving the problem of bound-to-continuum transitions, the transfer matrix method, is presented for the self-consistent calculations. Although the boundary conditions are relaxed due to the calculation self-consistentcy, inappropriate boundary conditions were previously included in the literature. The first observation of the quantum interference effect in the photocurrent spectra is described using a weakly coupled bound-to-continuum transition quantum well structure and electric field domain formation in the device. This effect persists even at high biases where Kronig-Penny minibands of periodic superlattice potential in the continuum are destroyed. Using this observation, the electric field domain formation and the electron coherence length in superlattices were analyzed. A large off-resonant energy level alignment between two neighboring wells in the high field domain was observed. The effect of temperature on the transport properties was also discussed. As a further study of electric field domain formation in superlattices, an optical experiment using Stark effect is suggested. The dependence of the absorption spectral linewidth of quantum well intersubband transitions on the electron population in the well is experimentally demonstrated using field-induced charge transfer and thermal-induced charge transfer in an asymmetric coupled quantum well structure. We show that this population-induced broadening {{is very important in}} the broadening of intersubband transitions in quantum well structures and that previously reported linewidth values for the contribution from donor scattering were overestimated. Many body effects and single-particle band non-parabolicity are the likely causes.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{theory for}} excitation of fluorescent molecules by beta decay electrons is {{reported in the}} accompanying manuscript; experimental detection methods and biological applications are reported here. The single photon signals produced by an excited fluorophore (single photon radioluminescence, SPR) provide quantitative information about the distance between radioisotope and fluorophore. Instrumentation was constructed for SPR signal detection. Photons produced in a 0. 5 -ml sample volume were detected by a cooled photomultiplier and photon counting electronics. To minimize electronic noise and drift for detection of very small SPR signals, a mechanical <b>light</b> <b>chopper</b> was used for gated-signal detection, and a pulse height analyzer for noise rejection. SPR signals of approximately 1 cps were reproducibly measurable. The influence of inner filter effect, sample turbidity, and fluorophore environment (lipid, protein, and carbohydrate) on SPR signals were evaluated experimentally. SPR was then applied to measure lipid exchange kinetics, ligand binding, and membrane transport, and to determine an intermolecular distance in an intact membrane. (a. Lipid exchange kinetics.) Transfer of 12 -anthroyloxystearic acid (12 -AS) from sonicated lipid vesicles and micelles to vesicles containing 3 H-cholesterol was measured from {{the time course of}} increasing SPR signal. At 22 degrees C, the half-times for 12 -AS transfer from vesicles and micelles were 3. 3 and 1. 1 min, respectively. (b. Ligand binding.) Binding of 3 H-oleic acid to albumin in solution, and 3 H- 2, 2 '-dihydro- 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanodisulfonic stilbene (3 H-H 2 DIDS) to band 3 on the erythrocyte membranes were detected by the radioluminescence of the intrinsic tryptophans. The SPR signal from 5 microCi 3 H-oleic acid bound to 0. 3 mM albumin decreased from 13 +/- 2 cps to 3 +/- 2 cps upon addition of nonradioactive oleic acid, giving 2. 7 high affinity oleic acid binding sites per albumin. The SPR signal from 1 microCi 3 H-H 2 DIDS bound selectively to erythrocyte band 3 in erythrocyte ghosts (1. 5 mg protein/ml) was 2. 2 +/- 0. 8 cps. (c. Membrane transport). Dilution of J 774 macrophages loaded with 3 H- 3 -O-methylglucose and BCECF gave a decreasing SPR signal with a half-time of 81 s due to methylglucose efflux; the SPR measurement of the efflux rate was in agreement with a conventional tracer efflux rate determination by filtration. 20 microM cytochalasin B inhibited efflux by 97 %.

40|$|Photocurrent Spectroscopy (PCS) is {{currently}} employed for {{the characterization of}} solid-state properties of semiconducting and insulating materials, since the knowledge of their band gap is a prerequisite to any possible application in different fields such as: solar energy conversion (photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic solar cells, photocatalysis) and microelectronics (high-k, high band-gap materials) (1 - 2). In the last 20 - 30 years {{an increasing number of}} scientists working in the area of corrosion has been attracted by this technique owing to its versatility and ability to scrutinize in situ corrosion layers and passive films having semiconducting or insulating behaviour. In previous works (3 - 4) we have shown that PCS is able to provide detailed information on characteristic energy levels of passive film/electrolyte junctions (flat band potential: Ufb; internal photoemission threshold: Eth; band gap value: Eg), which control the mechanism of charge transfer (electrons and ions) at the metal/corrosion layer/ electrolyte interface. Further advantages stem out from the fact that PCS does not require particular surface finishing control and can be used both in large area as well as in microscopic region of the electrode, and can reach high sensitivity by using a lock-in amplifier coupled to a mechanical <b>light</b> <b>chopper.</b> According to this, numerous experimental studies have shown how it is possible to scrutinize corrosion layer and passive films of very limited thickness grown on metals and alloys (Fe, Cr, Ni and SS) of relevant industrial interest (3 - 4 and refs. therein).

A green He-Ne laser was passed through a <b>light</b> <b>chopper</b> and Glan-Thompson prism before entering a crystal of Erbium doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er:YAG) (used in order to validate the experimental technique). The Er:YAG crystal is mounted in a press mechanism and the laser is quadruple passed through test specimen before being returned through the prism and the orthogonally polarized portion of the beam measured with a optical sensor. At a later stage, the Er:YAG crystal was replaced with a new crystal {{in order to determine the}} piezo-optic coefficients of this uncharacterized material. The applied load was monitored with the use of a 50 lb. load cell placed in line with the press. Light transmission readings were taken using a lock-in amplifier while load cell measurements were taken with a voltmeter from a 5 volt, 0. 5 amp power supply. Despite the fact that an effective crystal press damping system was developed, size limitations precluded the use of the complete system. For this reason, data points were taken only once per full turn so as to minimize the effect of non uniform load application on the collected data. Good correlation was found in the transmission data between the experimentally determined Er:YAG and the previously known peizo-optic constants of non-doped crystal with which it was compared. The variation which was found between the two could be accounted for by the aforementioned presence of Erbium in the experimental sample (for which exact empirical data was not known). The same test procedure was then carried out on a Yttrium Gallium Aluminum garnet (YGAG) for the purpose of establishing values of its unknown piezo-optic constant tensor using experimentally collected transmission data. Significant variation between the piezo-optic constants of YAG and YGAG crystals was found however, the excellent data correlation of separate experimental runs carried out on the YGAG sample demonstrates the validity of these results. The data collected during the stressing of the YGAG was of high quality, however the amount of data collected was somewhat limited by a fracture of YGAG specimen which undoubted altered the crystalline lattice structure and hence precluded any further testing...|$|E

A mechanical <b>light</b> <b>chopper</b> operating at 1200 Hz was used to obtain simultaneous measurements of the intracellular Ca 2 + activity with fluorescence excitation {{on either side of the}} isosbestic point (330 nm and 410 nm). The symmetry of the two optical Ca 2 + signals was used as a criterion to guard against artifacts resulting, for instance, from motion. The voltage {{dependence of}} peak Ca 2 + current and the Ca 2 + transient measured 25 ms after depolarizing clamps from a holding potential of - 40 mV were bell-shaped and virtually identical. The Ca 2 + entry estimated from the integral of the Ca 2 + current (0 mV, 25 ms) corresponds to a 5 - 10 microM increase in the total intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, whereas the optical signal indicated a 100 microM increase in total intracellular Ca 2 +. Repolarization of clamp pulses from highly positive potentials were accompanied by a second Ca 2 + transient, the magnitude of which, when summed with that measured during depolarization, was nearly constant. Ryanodine (10 microM) had little or no effect on the peak Ca 2 + current but reduced the magnitude of the early Ca 2 + transients by 70 - 90 %. Epinephrine (1 microM) increased the Ca 2 + current and the Ca 2 + transients, accelerated the rate of decline of the Ca 2 + transients at potentials between - 30 and + 70 mV, and reduced the intracellular [Ca 2 +] below baseline at potentials positive to + 80 or negative to - 40 mV, where clamp pulses did not elicit any Ca 2 + release. Elevation of intracellular cAMP mimicked the relaxant effect of epinephrine at depolarizing potentials, whereas elevation of extracellular [Ca 2 +] did not. These results suggest that most of the activator Ca 2 + in rat ventricular cells is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a graded response to sarcolemmal Ca 2 + influx. Consistent with a graded Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release we find that epinephrine increases the internal Ca 2 + release by increasing the Ca 2 + current. Epinephrine may also increase the Ca 2 + content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum that may, in turn, increase the Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release. The relaxant effect of epinephrine appears to be caused by enhanced rate of Ca 2 + resequestration and is mediated by adenylate cyclase system...|$|E
