5|$|By May 2015, {{the games}} were under a {{particularly}} dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money <b>laundering</b> to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money <b>laundering</b> conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Non <b>laundered</b> nomad {{populations in}} Iran {{experience}} more adverse living circumstances than <b>laundered</b> populations, {{but there is}} little research regarding the prevalence of mental health disorders of them. This study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety in <b>laundered</b> versus unlaundered nomads. Materials & Methods: 95 people of unlaundered nomads and 86 people of <b>laundered</b> nomads from Ashori family of Ghasghaee were assessed using Hamilton anxiety rating scale and Beck depression rating scale. The results were analyzed by SPSS software using chi - square test. Results: The depression rate in unlaundered nomads included 33. 7 % normal, 29. 5 % mild and 36. 5 % moderate and severe, but in <b>laundered</b> nomads, 84. 7 % were normal, 8. 2 % were mild and 7. 1 % were moderate and severe. The difference is statistically significant. The anxiety rate in unlaundered nomads proved to be 43. 2 % normal, 38. 9 % mild and 17. 9 % moderate and severe, but in <b>laundered</b> nomads 87. 2 % were normal, 7 % were mild and 5. 7 % were moderate and severe. The difference is statistically significant too. Depression rate in married uneducated and female subjects were more than those in singles and males in both <b>laundered</b> and unlaundered nomad. Anxiety rate in married uneducated and male subjects were more than those in singles and females in both <b>laundered</b> and unlaundered nomad. Conclusion: Depression and anxiety rates in unlaundered nomads were more than those in <b>laundered</b> nomads and these rates are higher than the national rates. These rates were more in married, group aged over 30 and in those with low education...|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money <b>laundering</b> through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money <b>laundering.</b> Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for <b>laundering,</b> and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, <b>laundering</b> money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money <b>laundering</b> by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E

5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money <b>laundering</b> in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money <b>laundering</b> charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E
