This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet <b>less</b> <b>a</b> broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was <b>less</b> <b>a</b> rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or <b>less</b> <b>a</b> specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage <b>less.</b> <b>A</b> predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E

5|$|Many of the government-operated {{residential}} {{schools were}} run by churches of various denominations, {{with the majority}} administered by Roman Catholics. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 schools in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by Roman Catholics; 21 were operated by the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were operated by the United Church of Canada, and 2 were operated by Presbyterians. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed {{by the federal government}} for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was <b>less</b> <b>a</b> reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, Hill {{visited the}} {{commanding}} officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at the bridge, and their commanding officer demanded that they {{be allowed to take}} control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours. The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but, despite fierce resistance, the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge and the surrounding area to the Germans. Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill. Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, <b>less</b> <b>a</b> small guard detachment that remained at Béja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road at the rear of the hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of witches and demonic forces {{was taken for}} granted by the American colonists—witchcraft was considered {{the work of the}} Devil. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a grand jury in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692–1693, in which 19people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much <b>less</b> <b>a</b> factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore, although the two often intermingled. New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area.|$|E

5|$|The {{flesh of}} the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or <b>less</b> <b>a</b> vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The {{flesh of the}} cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The flesh of the gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes <b>less</b> <b>a</b> night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning.

It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E
