40|$|An ongoing {{challenge}} in the aerospace industry is to implement novel ways in reducing the overall weight of a system so that significant cost savings ensue. For space-bound projects such as satellites, deployable structures must combine low mass and low volume, thus allowing {{the use of a}} smaller and less expensive launcher. The design of lightweight robust controllable hinges for these deployable structures is consequently very desirable. In this project, a deployment mechanism for a high packaging efficiency satellite SAR (synthetic aperture radar) membrane antenna is developed. The device, a hinge, should be compact, space qualified, lightweight and able to actuate the lateral deployment of a large antenna wing from its initial stowed state of 1. 2 m x 1. 4 m to its final functional shape of 5. 5 m x 4 m. Moreover, the controlled deployment to the final <b>latching</b> <b>into</b> place has to be achieved with low energy consumption and minimum dynamic disturbance. Based on an earlier concept of the Tape Spring Rolamite Hinge (TSR), a new controllable hinge has been designed to deploy and lock the antenna frame into a final stiff and straight configuration with minimal disturbance on the attitude control of the spacecraft.

40|$|The channel-forming protein OmpF porin from Escherichia coli {{spans the}} {{bacterial}} outer membrane. Each {{of the three}} monomers comprises a hollow, 16 -stranded beta-barrel. These are associated to homotrimers which are unusually stable, due mostly to hydrophobic interactions between the beta-barrels. In addition, a loop, L 2 connects one subunit to its neighbor by <b>latching</b> <b>into</b> its channel. Residue E 71 on loop 2 is integrated into an ionic network and forms salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with R 100 and R 132 on the channel wall in the adjacent subunit. To examine these contributions quantitatively, six single-site, two double, and one deletion mutant were constructed {{on the basis of}} the atomic coordinates of the protein. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis showed that the salt-bridge, E 71 -R 100, contributes significantly to trimer stability: the substitution E 71 Q causes a decrease of the transition temperature from 72 to 48 degreesC, with DeltaHcal diminishing from 430 to 201 kcal mol- 1. A nearby substitution in the loop, D 74 N, has lesser effects on thermal stability, while the deletion in L 2 (Delta 69 - 77) has an effect comparable to that of E 71 Q. X-ray structure analysis to 3. 0 A resolution revealed only local structural differences in the mutants except for the substitution R 100 A, where another residue, R 132, is found to fill the gap left by the truncated side chain of A 100.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a generic, three-phase innovation and technology policy (ITP) model which, {{in a number}} of contexts, could lead to the successful rise of venture capital (VC) or related equity-based support and finance systems for innovative SMEs both in high- and non-high-tech sectors. There has been increasing recognition that such systems could facilitate country attempts at <b>latching</b> <b>into</b> the ICT revolution, catching-up and deepening of R&D/Innovation; and for facilitating the transition to a knowledge/learning economy. Whereas the model is inspired by the successful Israeli experience during the 1969 - 2000 period, the other examples referred to in the paper suggest that it is adaptable to other contexts as well. A critical analytical point is whether, in the wake of direct government support of business sector (BS) R&D/Innovation (Phase 1), conditions will emerge for the successful emergence of VC or related industries in Phase 3 (and, whenever necessary, for the successful policy targeting of such industries). These are termed Phase 2 conditions; and the paper refers to three Phase 2 profiles: the Israeli profile; the Chilean profile; and a third 'strategic' profile, which seems to have been adopted by Korea. The analysis strongly suggests that a multiphase ITP model could be an important analytical tool both for policy analysis and for policy making. Over and beyond its emphasis on the dynamic links between direct Government support of BS R&D/innovation and subsequent policies directed to VC, the paper also shows that policy could be subject to increasing rather than to decreasing returns.

40|$|Customer {{preferences}} in food products, whether in ACP States or elsewhere, are forever changing, {{driven by the}} fashions and fads of the local urban market, and interregional and international markets. Farmers and food processors {{who are interested in}} expanding their business have to take customer choice into account, and follow the rule of law, and the rule of thumb, as far as hygiene, quality and product image is concerned. A dish of starch, accompanied by a sauce of sorts to help it down, has been the basis of nine in ten of mankind's meals since the beginning of time. In ACP countries the model varies according to the ingredients of the one (starch, cassava meal, rice, banana, sorghum, maize) or the other (fish, chicken, meat, vegetables, leaves and condiments). There are, though, changes afoot in consumer tastes for food. Urban demand is growing, and food processing enterprises are expanding their range of products, sometimes with the traditional being given a modern, processed, presentation (powdered yam, cassava flour, peanut butter, ground peppers). New products are emerging in response to the needs of migrant communities who bring in new food habits. The forefront of these changes is often {{at the level of the}} street food stalls, popular for their practicality as well as their exotic side. Imported products are now being easily taken up: they are cheaper than local products, and they meet the needs both of urban consumers and mobile vendors in terms of ease of use and quality. Rice, Maggi stock cubes, tomato concentrate from Turkey, Italy and Greece, bread and canned corned beef are pushing local products aside. Some nostalgic souls (men!) deplore the arrival of artificial manufactured flavouring in the family kitchen, though it does not stop them from 'shamelessly dipping a chunk of bread smeared with mayonnaise from a tube in a cup of Nescafé sweetened with concentrated milk'. As for the women of the household, they free themselves from the kitchen to pursue their busy lives outside, seemingly rattling their spoons like swords. Packaging adds value Packaging is the way forward, even in developing countries: packaging a product gives it appeal, keeps it in good condition, and seduces the customer. Small problem : not everyone can afford it. Many food processing enterprises, small in size and usually in the informal sector, are put off by the complexity of modern packaging and the investment it requires. In Côte d'Ivoire, for example, where the packaging industry is the most developed and diversified of all West African countries, steps are under way to make the best possible use of existing resources and make inexpensive and good quality packaging materials available to local businesses. The Kraft food company is studying the production of paper packing from bagasse (crushed sugar cane) and local and imported recycled paper; another study is on the use of coconut coir for making string; a project for sisal cultivation is underway, and a pilot plant is starting produce cardboard boxes to replace imported packaging. In Burkina Faso, three small Ouagadougou firms producing dried foods have come with several solutions for soft packaging (which makes up almost 35 % of the product's cost price). The first replaced its handicraft printed packaging with one produced industrially, with a zippy modern look. The second producer found a market niche by using packaging produced on the premises. And the third sells part of its output using generic packaging (without any brand name) shared with other firms, thus <b>latching</b> <b>into</b> more promotion possibilities and sales networks. It still uses its own brand packaging for its own special product lines. New life for local products Thanks to processing techniques, new products can be developed from familiar local primary products. And so it has come to pass that many businesses and cooperatives have launched whole product lines based on a narrow range of farm produce. Take the case of Molige, a small processing company in Cameroon which produces jams and fruit juices. By using a variety of packaging from 35 grams to 7 kg it can serve clients ranging from household level, through hotels, to airlines. Similarly women's groups have processed products on offer. Often they breathe new life into surplus materials : biscuits based on groundnuts, natural drinks made from cereals and wild fruits, and wine from sorghum, sorrel and guava. Such processed products do not yet have a firm foothold in local markets, however, due to the combination of local consumers' weak purchasing power and strong competition from traditional and imported goods. More success can be found in the wholesale markets of Europe where there are some runaway winners such as the Côte d'Ivoire cooperative Promexa, which sells its atiéké (cassava couscous) as far afield as Europe. These leaders have met the pre-conditions of overcoming not a few obstacles in transport and conservation, and of fulfilling the veritable arsenal of very strict hygiene and quality standards. Hygiene and quality labelling The quality of marketed food products depends primarily on the processors. But they depend on improvements in both products and hygiene upstream, on the farm. And these are seen differently from culture to culture, embracing not only the actual hygiene of the product itself, but also of its 'environment' (packaging, storage, transport). Hence the importance of a food code to protect consumer health, underlined in 1985 by a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly which called upon governments to support and adopt the standards of the Codex Alimentarius of the FAO and the World Health Organisation. These standards cover the general principles dealing with food additives, contaminants, analysis and sampling methods, and labelling of all foods. They provide a real code of conduct for the international foodstuffs industry. Many developing countries have established bodies for control and standardisation which will guarantee consumer food safety and the quality of commercialised foods. In Burkina Faso, a sanitary programme has been running for a decade in the field of poultry: 500 vaccinators work to build up the awareness of poultry breeders on issues of animal health, and, ultimately, of consumer health issues. In Senegal the Office for the Control of Fishery Products has been designated by the authorities as the competent body for checking sanitary standards. Bodies like these essentially deal with food products destined for the export market, but they should ? along with the standards of the Codex Alimentarius ? provide practical guidelines for the marketing and improvement of products for the local and regional markets.

In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R
5000|$|A {{synchronous}} circuit is {{a digital}} circuit {{in which the}} changes in the state of memory elements are synchronized by a clock signal.

This clock signal is applied to every storage element, so in an ideal synchronous circuit, every change in the logical levels of its storage components is simultaneous. Ideally, the input to each storage element has reached its final value before the next clock occurs, so the behaviour of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly. Practically, some delay is required for each logical operation, resulting in a maximum speed at which each synchronous system can run.|$|R

Gaerity reveals that he has set up another bomb in Kate's car and activates its arming mechanism before engaging with Dove in a large mêlée fight throughout the booby-trapped ship, which has been rigged to blow up in a few minutes. Dove gains the upper hand, but Gaerity handcuffs himself to him, preventing him from leaving. Dove is saved by Franklin at the last second, who had followed Dove to the ship, and the two escape in time before the ship explodes, killing Gaerity in the process.|$|R
