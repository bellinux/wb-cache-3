25|$|Simultaneously, the Soviet Navy seize Iceland in {{a covert}} {{surprise}} attack {{with an air}} raid disabling the NATO air base at Keflavík and a landing of amphibious forces from the Soviet merchant ship Julius Fucik disguised as a Lykes Lines American <b>LASH</b> <b>ship,</b> capturing Keflavík and eliminating the GIUK-SOSUS line to allow the Soviet Navy to surge its submarines into the Atlantic Ocean without being detected. Supported by KGB personnel hidden in the Soviet Embassy in Iceland, the Soviets rapidly disband the Althing and occupy the island without resistance, although they impose a brutal administration. Realizing the futility of the situation, USAF Lieutenant Mike Edwards escapes from Keflavik with several Marines, and makes radio contact with a British station in Scotland. With the military unable to withdraw him, he is ordered {{to remain on the}} island for reconnaissance work. Although the first NATO air raid on Iceland has only limited success due to their decision to ignore Edwards' advice about the presence of MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, later raids are more successful. Although Edwards is initially nervous and inexperienced, he soon breaks protocol by rescuing a 20-year old Icelandic girl, Vigdis Agustdottir, from being raped by Soviet looters, summarily executing the rapists after discovering that they have already killed her family and due to experiencing a similar incident with his former girlfriend Sandy. The men dispose of the bodies by faking a car accident, destroy the Agustdottir family's house, and take a visibly traumatized Vigdis with them. They are soon accompanied by a group of Royal Marines.|$|E

50|$|The Illyrians <b>lashed</b> their <b>ships</b> {{in batches}} {{of four and}} thus engaged the enemy. They sacrificed their own ships, {{presenting}} them broadside to their adversaries in a position favouring their charge, but when the enemy’s ships had charged and struck them and getting fixed in them found themselves in difficulty. In each case the four <b>ships</b> <b>lashed</b> together were hanging on their beaks, while the Illyrians leapt on the decks of the Achaean ships and overmastered them by their numbers. In this way they captured 4 quadriremes and sunk with all hands a quinquereme, on board of which was Margos of Keryneia.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} technical problem {{raised by}} {{the invention of the}} new transport system was the shape of the lighters. Several other designs, differentiated mainly by the shape of the lighters and the loading mechanism, were proposed, but the LASH system found the largest range of applications. In this approach, the lighters were individually lifted onto the carrier ship by a large crane located at the stern of the ship. The crane could move {{the entire length of the}} ship and stack the lighters atop each other in the ship's body and on the deck. The cranes had a load-carrying capacity of more than 500 Mp. Loading or unloading a lighter took on average fifteen minutes. <b>LASH</b> <b>ships</b> were constructed in Europe, Japan and the USA with almost uniform parameters.|$|R

25|$|The {{warships}} of {{the time}} were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, <b>lashing</b> the two <b>ships</b> together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.|$|R

50|$|While the {{explosion}} {{was not a}} full force detonation, it blew a 12x8ft hole in her Starboard side and started a large fire on the Stern of the Badger State. The order to abandon ship went out immediately despite the continuing bad weather, which was then <b>lashing</b> the <b>ship</b> with 25 ft waves and 40 knot winds. No sooner had crew unlashed two rubber liferafts the howling winds tore them off {{the deck of the}} ship. Two other rubber liferafts were lowered into the water, only to be overturned and throwing two men into the water. With the rubber rafts gone, the entire ships compliment had to squeeze into the one operating lifeboat, the other having been damaged by the high seas.|$|R
5|$|The {{disposition}} {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf <b>lashed</b> his <b>ships</b> side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows projected beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all hands free to fight, that a barrier could be formed with the oars and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another advantage to the defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would have to shoot upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|R

50|$|The lighter aboard <b>ship</b> (<b>LASH)</b> system {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of loading barges (lighters) aboard a bigger vessel for transport. It was developed in response to a need to transport lighters, a type of unpowered barge, between inland waterways separated by open seas. Lighters are typically towed or pushed around harbors, canals or rivers and cannot be relocated under their own power. The carrier ships are known variously as LASH carriers, barge carriers, kangaroo ships or lighter transport ships.|$|R

500|$|The {{first known}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was observed on September3, about halfway between the Bahamas and Bermuda.

Thereafter, the hurricane turned toward the northeast, and the ship [...] "John Richardson" [...] encountered gale force winds on September5, resulting in a wreck of its cargo. On September6, it was estimated to have reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h), based on observations from the ship with the call sign [...] "Greenock". The hurricane <b>lashed</b> the <b>ship</b> with strong winds for 14hours, killing the captain and one crewman. At the time, it was about 400mi (640km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

50|$|She {{subsequently}} {{shifted to}} Buckner Bay, Okinawa, {{to serve as}} storage tanker there in September. On 9 October, a particularly heavy and violent typhoon swept over Okinawa. Vandalia ran aground at 1518, coming to rest about 200 yd from Miyegusuku Lighthouse on Naha Island and sinking rapidly. The 140 kn winds <b>lashed</b> the <b>ship,</b> and heavy seas pounded the old tanker unmercifully. One engine failed, and the ship went out of control, carried along with the fury of the typhoon, as the ships force determinedly tried to pump out the engine room, fire room, and after compartments.

5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to <b>lash</b> the <b>ships</b> together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|R

5000|$|A lighter {{is a type}} of {{flat-bottomed}} barge used {{to transfer}} goods and passengers to and from moored ships. Lighters were traditionally unpowered and were moved and steered using long oars called [...] "sweeps" [...] and the motive power of water currents. They were operated by highly skilled workers called lightermen and were a characteristic sight in London's docks until about the 1960s, when technological changes made this form of lightering largely redundant. Unpowered lighters continue to be moved by powered tugs, however, and lighters may also now themselves be powered. The term is also used in the Lighter Aboard <b>Ship</b> (<b>LASH)</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built upon two <b>ships</b> <b>lashed</b> {{together}} {{and consisted of}} towers between which an assault bridge was hoisted.

With it, fell the fortunes of the eastern wave against Rhodes, the Pontic king withdrawing.Fifteen years later, Mithridates again used a siege engine, in his unsuccessful attack on Cyzicus. [...] Later classical sources confuse the sambuca for a ship mounted siege tower. Vegetius used the term sambuca as the name given to the assault ramp mounted on a siege tower.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the heat of this fight, as I was very busy upon the quarter-deck, the captain calls to me, for he never stirred from us, [...] "What the devil is friend William a-doing yonder?" [...] says the captain; [...] "has he any {{business}} upon, deck?" [...] I stepped forward, and there was friend William, with two or three stout fellows, <b>lashing</b> the <b>ship's</b> bowsprit fast to our mainmast, for fear they should get away from us; {{and every now and then}} he pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave the men a dram to encourage them. The shot flew about his ears as thick as may be supposed in such an action, where the Portuguese, to give them their due, fought very briskly, believing at first they were sure of their game, and trusting to their superiority; but there was William, as composed, and in as perfect tranquillity as to danger, as if he had been over a bowl of punch, only very busy securing the matter, that a ship of forty-six guns should not run away from a ship of eight-and-twenty.|$|R
500|$|Temeraire then rammed {{into the}} Redoutable, {{dismounting}} {{many of the}} French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew <b>lashed</b> the two <b>ships</b> together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire {{as she did so}} from the 112-gun Spanish ship Santa Ana lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship Fougueux, which came up on Temeraires un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of 100yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled {{in a letter to his}} wife [...] "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle <b>ships</b> <b>lashed</b> to her." [...] Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.|$|R
5000|$|San Rafael sank near Alcatraz Island on November 30, 1901, {{following}} a collision {{in the fog}} with the steam ferry Sausalito. [...] Both vessels were owned by the same company, the North Pacific Coast Railroad. San Rafael was bound across San Francisco Bay, from San Francisco to Sausalito. [...] Both vessels were proceeding slowly and ringing fog bells. Both captains realized the other ship was near, and had ordered the engines reversed, {{but it was too}} late to prevent a collision. Sausalito struck San Rafael broadside and penetrated ten feet into the dining room, then occupied by many passengers. Prompt action by the captains of the two vessels, in <b>lashing</b> the <b>ships</b> together, kept San Rafael afloat long enough for most of the passengers and crew to evacuate to Sausalito. A boiler explosion on San Rafael was averted when a fireman went into the fireroom, then neck-deep in water, and opened a valve to bleed off the steam in the boilers. Twenty minutes after the collision, San Rafael sank in around 120 feet of water. This sinking is said to have inspired Jack London in writing the opening scenes of his novel The Sea Wolf. [...] The captain of San Rafael, John Tayler Mackenzie, was the last person to leave the sinking vessel.|$|R

5000|$|On 23 September 1779, the {{squadron}} encountered the Baltic Fleet of 41 sail under convoy of the HMS Serapis and HM hired armed vessel Countess of Scarborough near Flamborough Head. The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6:00 p.m. The battle continued {{for the next}} four hours, costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews. British victory seemed inevitable, as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect. The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender. He replied, [...] "Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!" [...] Jones eventually managed to <b>lash</b> the <b>ships</b> together, nullifying his opponent's greater maneuverability and allowing him {{to take advantage of the}} larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard. An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed, as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard. Finally, after another of Jones's ships joined the fight, the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10:30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard [...] - [...] shattered, on fire, leaking badly [...] - [...] defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, 25 September 1779.

Three of Mississippi's men, Seaman Andrew Brinn, Boatswain's Mate Peter Howard, and U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Pinkerton R. Vaughn, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the abandonment. She lost 64 men, with the accompanying ships saving 223 of her crew.|$|R
