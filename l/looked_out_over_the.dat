2500|$|In his {{freshman}} year of college in 2007, when Yom Kippur (the holiest {{day of the year}} in Judaism; a fast day that is the [...] "Day of Atonement") fell on a Saturday, he fasted until an hour before the Big Ten Conference opener against Iowa started that night. Carimi said, [...] "Religion is a part of me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. I actually do make sacrifices that I know are hard choices.” [...] At the 2011 NFL combine, when asked whether he would play on Yom Kippur in the NFL, he responded: [...] "I already <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 15 years, and Yom Kippur doesn't fall on a Sunday." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the design}} and its execution, Shibe hired William Steele and Sons. Their {{engineering}} staff had worked with the new technology of steel-reinforced concrete, and designed and built the city's first skyscraper, the Witherspoon Building at Walnut and Juniper Streets. The Steele design for the Shibe façade was in the ornate French Renaissance style, including arches, vaultings, and Ionic pilasters. The grandstand walls were to be of red brick and terra cotta and featured elaborate decorative friezes with baseball motifs, while cartouches framed the Athletics' [...] "A" [...] logo at regular intervals above the entrances. The souvenir program on Opening Day called it [...] "a fetching combination of color." [...] Gabled dormer windows on the upper deck's copper-trimmed green-slate mansard roof <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> streets below. Presiding over all were terra cotta busts of Shibe and Mack above the main entrances on Lehigh and 21st.|$|E

2500|$|Fort Santa Barbára (Spanish: Fuerte de Santa Barbára) {{stood at}} {{the eastern end of}} the line. Its {{pentagonal}} structure was aimed like an arrowhead south at Gibraltar and supported 24 gun positions, with a bastion trace in the gorge, a dry ditch, a covered way and a glacis. The two eastern sides of the fort <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, while the south-facing side enfiladed part of the eastern side of Gibraltar and the isthmus. James recorded that its rampart was [...] "thirty feet broad, and mounted with twelve iron fifteen pounders, and one thirteen inch brass mortar." [...] It had a considerably stronger rear than San Felipe as the rampart was continued at the same thickness around the entire circumference of the fort. There were four large bombproof casemates under the ramparts and, as at San Felipe, a sea wall held back the waves. The peacetime garrison of the fort was the same as at San Felipe, with one captain, one subaltern and fifty men.|$|E
