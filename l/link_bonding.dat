40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review is presented of single molecule junction conductance measurements across families of molecules measured while breaking a gold point contact {{in a solution}} of molecules with amine end groups. A theoretical framework unifies the picture for the amine-gold <b>link</b> <b>bonding</b> and the tunnel coupling through the junction using Density Functional Theory based calculations. The reproducible electrical characteristics and utility for many molecules is shown to result from the selective binding between the gold electrodes and amine link groups through a donor-acceptor bond to undercoordinated gold atoms. While the bond energy is modest, the maximum force sustained by the junction is comparable to, but less than, that required to break gold point contacts. The calculated tunnel coupling provides conductance trends for all 41 molecule measurements presented here, as well as insight into the variability of conductance due to the conformational changes within molecules with torsional degrees of freedom. The calculated trends agree to within a factor {{of two of the}} measured values for conductance ranging from 10 - 7 G 0 to 10 - 2 G 0, where G 0 is the quantum of conductance (2 e 2 /h).

Instead of adopting the standard approach of a cross-section estimation of the term structure of real interest rates, this work proposes a pricing model based on the estimation of inflation risk premium. The model is applied to Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS's), which are inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by the U. S. Department of the Treasury.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} risk of inflation and diminishing pension benefits, insurance companies have started selling in°ation-linked products. Selling such products the insurance company takes over {{some or all of}} the inflation risk from their customers. On the other side financial derivatives which are linked to inflation such as inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bonds</b> are traded on financial markets and appear to be of increasing popularity. The insurance company can use these products to hedge its own inflation risk. In this article we study how to optimally manage a pension fund taking positions in a money market account, a stock and an inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bond,</b> while financing investments through a continuous stochastic income stream such as the plan member's contributions.

Each regime is modeled using an autoregressive process with different parameters and the change in regimes is governed by a two state Markov chain. Once the parameters have been estimated, the predictive validity of the regime-switching process as a model for inflation in South Africa is tested and a hedging strategy is outlined for a set of inflation linked cash flows.

40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} {{are a key}} economic variable for investors in capital markets and for economic policy decision makers. One of the widely used sources for deriving inflation {{expectations are}} market prices of bonds. The yield differential between nominal <b>bonds</b> and inflation-indexed (<b>linked)</b> <b>bonds</b> is taken to be an estimate of expected inflation. The problem is however that in a risk averse world the yield differential includes an inflation risk premium and thus the yield differential provides an upward bias of inflation expectations. The novelty of our paper is that we estimate this risk premium using volatility implied in options prices. In {{the absence of a}} market in options on inflation we use prices of foreign currency options to estimate this risk premium. The theoretical foundation of our methodology is purchasing power parity theory. The Israeli financial market has both, an inflation linked and non <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> market and an active FX options market. Using data from both markets we find a statistically and economically significant inflation risk premium. ...|$|R

The commodity <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> resolves this moral hazard problem. Second, we show that in the presence of moral hazard problems the traditional application of contingent claims valuation techniques leads to an incorrect valuation of the the real assets and consequently to an incorrect valuation of the financial liabilities written against those assets.
