The Guardian's John Fordham rated the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "The work of New York saxophonist/composer Tim Berne can {{sometimes}} be almost forbiddingly rugged and demanding, but the coherence on this session, and the assertiveness mixed with an unfamiliar mellowness in his tone, amount to a new <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> and confidence for him". The Austin Chronicle's Michael Chamy noted [...] "The Shell Game plays like an epic novel, full of unexpected twists and turns, ultimately rewarding the repeat listener with a powerful cocktail, equal parts inspiration and intrigue". The All About Jazz review said that [...] "The Shell Game ranks with Berne's best work. It presents a wide variety of textures and moods. At times the trio pursues deceptively straightforward progressions; at others it takes them apart to the very last nuance—and when you least expect it, they break free into exciting groove-driven jams. The only fault one might find with this record is that Berne's playing can sometimes be painfully relentless, because he seems to have a very high threshold sic for tension. But that's a minor criticism relative to what otherwise is a surprisingly inventive and creatively resonant recording".Writing in JazzTimes Daniel Piotrowski noted [...] "Berne sticks to the modus operandi of his recent bands: long, meandering pieces with structured melodies making recurring, intermittent appearances. More so than in Berne's other bands, his sidemen are here mostly for texture and support rather than complete integration. In return, Taborn and Rainey create a lot of space for Berne to solo in as much as he likes-and he does at marathon lengths during the four drawn-out pieces".|$|E

Patenting activity in new technological fields follows a sigmoid (S-shaped) path. Qualitative and quantitative models in management and economics literature explain why such patterns of productivity may occur. TRIZ analysis suggests that patents are generated in bursts during {{the evolution of a}} product and that they are at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness.</b> The tendency is for the inventiveness to reduce as the product is more mature. This makes it possible to guess at the lifetime stage of a product and gauge its maturity and profitability.

40|$|In the {{conditions}} of constant market changes, fast development and spread of technology, multiply competition and „over night” product superannuation, successful companies became those who create new knowledge, spread it out trough the entire company and implement it rapidly in the new technologies and products. These activities define company as knowledge – creating organization which only and principal task is ongoing innovation. Those are the companies that understood that the learning and new knowledge {{are the key to}} success, and that the development is crucial for future survival. The notion of education, development and knowledge creating company, or in other words an organization that develops and learns, in the most pragmatic way expresses the attitude of modern, successful companies versus the development and knowledge of employees. Another name for this kind of organization is knowledge – based organization. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that the employee development is a key procedure in implementing human resource politics. In order to create learning organization it is a necessity for the employees to have formal and informal education and to acquire it throughout entire professional career. Life-long learning politics is the basic premise of the company’s market competiveness considering the fact that the knowledge is the only resource that grows with use and not disburse. The main conclusion of the paper states that the most successful companies and national economies are those based on knowledge, or in other words highly educated and trained human resources. High <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> and innovations, without which a modern market cannot be imagined, can be achieved only in following the path of permanent employee development, which also represents one of the main motivators in accomplishing efficiency and effectiveness of the companies...|$|E
40|$|The polysemiotic {{nature of}} subtitled films, whereby textual {{information}} (the subtitles) {{is combined with}} other audiovisual cues (the pictures and the soundtrack of the film) makes them very vulnerable {{as a form of}} translation, as well as a peculiar one: a consequence of the process of subtitling is that both the original (or source text) and the translation (target text) are presented simultaneously to viewers. The possibility of clashes between source and target texts is therefore very great, and incoherencies produced by the juxtaposition of visual referents from the source-language cultural sphere alongside textual referents originating from the target language are often commented upon by translation specialists. Whilst it is widely admitted that the use of cultural substitution – that is when a cultural reference in the source-text is replaced by another one in the target language – in subtitles should be resorted to with extreme caution, a coherent and consistent approach is also absolutely paramount in order to maintain viewers’ suspension of disbelief throughout the film. Looking at a corpus of films from the 1990 s portraying predominantly African American characters, this paper analyses {{the ways in which the}} dialogues have been subtitled into French. While in most films subtitles display a tendency to neutralise the non-standard features of the original, some also reveal a great <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> and creativity: the juxtaposition in the subtitled films of features that are culturally-bound (whether to the source or to the target culture) produces a hybrid. Whilst the use of non-standard features from the target language in the subtitles can be justified by connotations they have in common with African American Vernacular English, the use of such features is not unproblematic and raises important issues...|$|E

A proposta visa favorecer as relações interpessoais existentes nos contextos escolares. Em um primeiro momento, a pesquisa obteve dados a respeito de patentes como indicadores de inovação tecnológica. Utilizou-se esse recurso como estratégia de prospecção para a conceituação do Estado da Arte. Ao verificar as informações contidas nas patentes, investigou-se, também, o grau de inventividade existente nos produtos atuais. A ideia foi a de aplicar as melhores práticas no objeto em questão. Posteriormente, efetuou-se um estudo etnográfico para analisar o cotidiano de uma criança com deficiência física, matriculada na Rede Municipal de Educação de Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. Com isso, buscou-se compreender o ambiente a ser trabalhado e coletar informações com familiares e profissionais que lidam com essa criança. Paralelo à realização do estudo, foi utilizado um modelo de referência para a estruturação de um recurso assistivo, praticando intensamente as fases de Planejamento, Projeto Informacional, Projeto Conceitual e Projeto Detalhado, em cooperação com a "voz do usuário" e de seus cuidadores. Ainda na fase conceitual, foi desenvolvida uma solução orientada ao contexto escolar, dedicada às séries iniciais. Como desfecho da presente pesquisa, tem-se o desenvolvimento de uma cadeira de rodas infantil, culminando com a confecção de um protótipo que apresenta diferenciais relacionados à mobilidade e interação. This {{dissertation}} presents some {{contributions to}} the design of the wheelchair as a children’s mobility system. The proposal aims at facilitating the interpersonal relations that take place in the school environment. At an early stage, the research obtained data related to patents as technological innovation indicators. This resource was used as a prospecting strategy for creating the State of the Art concept. By checking the information contained in the patents, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> of current products was investigated as well. The idea was to apply the best practices to the object in question. Later, an ethnographic research was conducted in order to analyze the daily life of a child with physical disabilities attending the Municipal Education System of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. Hence, we sought to understand the setting to be worked on and to collect information from relatives and professionals who deal with this child. Along with the development of this study, a model of reference for the structuring of an assistive resource was used, with an intensive practice of the stages of Planning, Information Project, Conceptual Project and Detailed Project, in cooperation with the “user’s voice” and his caretakers. Still at the conceptual stage, a solution oriented towards the school environment was developed, aimed at the early grades of primary school. The outcome of the present research is the development of a pediatric wheelchair, ending in the production of a prototype that features distinguished improvements related to mobility and interaction...|$|E

To select the winners, expert criteria had been used up to now, which in many cases was strongly influenced by subjectivity. This paper describes the methodology developed by request of the TECNOS award steering committee, looking for more consistent, sustainable and repeatable methods. The methodology is based on concepts of TRIZ, Value Engineering and the Kano Model.

Radar diagrams for the pattern of evolution are combined with the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> and paired comparison, {{on the basis of a}} 1000 points scale. The methodology is assisted by a VBA program in Excel that facilitates the evaluation process.

40|$|International audience﻿This paper {{presents}} the results of a study designed to compare the processes followed by practitioners of three design methods: the algorithm of inventive problem solving, axiomatic design, and environment-based design. Prior literature has postulated the complementary nature of these design methods, and in some cases, has provided case studies of their mutual application on a design problem. However, prior studies have not focused on the de-tailed activities used in each method to examine the similarities and differences in the outputs of the activities. In this study, a series of three one-day and three three-day design exercises were conducted simultaneously by three international research groups, each focusing on one method. The objectives of this study were to examine {{the early stages of the}} design process that deal with macro activities: problem analysis, problem synthesis, and design evalua-tion and decision making. Several micro design activities were conducted within these, depending on the design method: clarification of requirements, gathering information on existing technologies, initial conceptualization of an assembly of technologies, the identification of system contradictions/coupling, and the solution of contradictions. The objectives of this comparative study were to establish, from observations of practitioners [...] rather than from a theoretical point of view [...] the differences and complementarities between the design methods. The problems pre-sented to designers covered a range of design tasks that spanned multiple disciplines, multiple <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> open-endedness/specificity of the task, and various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> required.

A total of 621 (303 boys, 318 girls, Mage = 13. 9, SD = 2. 5) 4 th to 12 th grade students from 112 schools all over China participated in the study. Among them, 38 (20 boys, 18 girls, Mage = 14. 9, SD = 3. 3) reported holding one or more patents. Independent t-test showed, compared to their lower-level counterparts, higher-level young inventors were more intrinsically motivated for inventive endeavours and were more open to new experiences. They also reported more encouragement and resources for invention from their schools. Logistic regression showed that school encouragement made the major contribution in discriminating these two groups. 2 × 3 MANONA revealed a significant main effect of gender and age group but no significant interaction between the two factors. Results of the univariate tests challenged the stereotyped view against the inventive ability of girls. Girls scored higher in Openness and lower in executive thinking style. The aesthetic appeal of their inventive products was also rated higher by experts. Albeit this superiority, girls, however, reported less encouragement from their parents to make inventions. Results of the cross-sectional study of the different age groups did not support a hypothesized growth <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> from the lower to the higher grades.
