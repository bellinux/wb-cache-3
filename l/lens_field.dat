50|$|In photography, {{the field}} of view is {{that part of the world}} that is visible through the camera at a {{particular}} position and orientation in space; objects outside the FOV when the picture is taken are not recorded in the photograph. It is most often expressed as the angular size of the view cone, as an angle of view. For normal <b>lens,</b> <b>field</b> of view can be calculated FOV = 2 arctan(SensorSize/2f), where f is focal length.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{introduction}} of the OM-D E-M5 in February, 2012, none of the Olympus designs included a built-in EVF. Olympus has four available add-on hotshoe viewfinders. The Olympus VF-1 is an optical viewfinder with an angle of view of 65 degrees, equivalent to the 17mm pancake <b>lens</b> <b>field</b> of view, and was designed primarily for the EP-1. Olympus has since introduced the high resolution VF-2 EVF, and a newer, less expensive, slightly lower resolution VF-3 for use in all its MFT cameras after the Olympus EP-1. These EVF's not only slip into the accessory hotshoe, but also plug into a dedicated proprietary port for power and communication with Olympus cameras only. Both the VF-2 and VF-3 may also be used on high-end Olympus compact point and shoot cameras such as the Olympus XZ-1. Olympus announced the VF-4 in May 2013, along with the fourth generation PEN flagship, the E-P5.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} the main current research interests of scientists {{working in the}} contact <b>lens</b> <b>field.</b> MethodsAll articles published in the 2011 issues of all journals included in the Journal Citation Reports subject category Ophthalmology were inspected to expose those papers related to the contact <b>lens</b> <b>field.</b> Information regarding source journal was obtained and authorship details were recorded to {{determine the}} top most prolific authors, institutions and countries. A comprehensive list of key words was compiled to generate a two-dimensional term map in which the frequency of occurrence of a particular term is defined by label size and the distance between two terms {{is an indication of}} the relatedness of these terms, based on their co-occurrences within groups of key words. Clusters of related terms were also identified. ResultsVisual examination of all articles uncovered a total of 156 papers, published in 28 different journals. Contact Lens & Anterior Eye, Eye & Contact Lens and Optometry and Vision Science had 27 articles each. The most prolific authors and institutions revealed the predominance of countries with long research tradition in the contact <b>lens</b> <b>field.</b> Ten different word clusters or areas of interest were identified, including both traditional, yet unresolved issues (e. g., comfort or dry eye), and the latest research efforts (e. g., myopia control). ConclusionsThese findings, which revealed contact lenses to be a fertile area of research, may be of relevance to new researchers as well as to those interested in exploring the latest research trends in this scientific discipline...|$|E

50|$|To {{achieve the}} in-camera effect, a reel {{would be made}} up of pre-exposed and {{developed}} film, and unexposed raw film, which would then be loaded into the camera. The exposed film would sit in front of the unexposed film, with the emulsion of both films touching each other, causing the images on the exposed film to be contact-printed onto the unexposed stock, along with the image from the camera lens. This method, in conjunction with a static matte placed in front of the camera, could be used to print angry storm clouds into a background on a studio set. The process differs from Optical Printing in that no optical elements (<b>lenses,</b> <b>field</b> <b>lenses,</b> etc.) separate the two films. Both films are sandwiched together in the same camera and make use of a phenomenon known as contact printing.|$|R

40|$|The {{resolution}} of available low-voltage SEM (LVSEM) models {{used in the}} characterization of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) is limited {{by a number of}} factors including energy spread in the electron source, beam brightness, scanning electron detector geometry, and various lens aberrations.

The improvements include a cold cathode FE source which has an extremely low inherent energy spread and high brightness, a second condenser lens to converge the beam and maintain an optimum aperture half-angle, and a detector optimized for low-voltage scanning-electron collection.

50|$|The term {{backscatter}} {{in photography}} refers to {{light from a}} flash or strobe reflecting back from particles in the <b>lens's</b> <b>field</b> of view causing specks of light {{to appear in the}} photo. This gives rise to what are sometimes referred to as orb artifacts. Photographic backscatter can result from snowflakes, rain or mist, or airborne dust. Due to the size limitations of the modern compact and ultra-compact cameras, especially digital cameras, the distance between the lens and the built-in flash has decreased, thereby decreasing the angle of light reflection to the lens and increasing the likelihood of light reflection off normally sub-visible particles. Hence, the orb artifact is commonplace with small digital or film camera photographs.|$|R

40|$|International audienceStandard {{electron}} optics predicts Larmor image rotation in the magnetic <b>lens</b> <b>field</b> of a TEM. Introducing {{the possibility to}} produce electron vortex beams with quantized orbital angular momentum brought up the question of their rotational dynamics {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Recently, it has been shown that electron vortex beams can be prepared as free electron Landau states showing peculiar rotational dynamics, including no and cyclotron (double-Larmor) rotation. Additionally very fast Gouy rotation of electron vortex beams has been observed. In this work a model is developed which reveals that the rotational dynamics of electron vortices are a combination of slow Larmor and fast Cony rotations and that the Landau states naturally occur in the transition region in between the two regimes. This more general picture is confirmed by experimental data showing an extended set of peculiar rotations, including no, cyclotron. Larmor and rapid Cony rotations all present in one single convergent electron vortex beam. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Process {{variations}} due to lens aberrations are to a {{large extent}} systematic, and can be modeled for purposes of analyses and optimiza-tions in the design phase. Traditionally, variations induced by lens aberrations have been considered random due to their small extent. However, as process margins reduce, and as improvements in reticle enhancement techniques control variations due to other sources with increased efficacy, lens aberration-induced variations gain importance. For example, our experiments indicate that lens aberration can result in up to 8 % variation in cell delay. Aberration-induced variations are systematic and depend on the location in the <b>lens</b> <b>field.</b> In this paper, we propose an aberration-aware timing-driven analytical placement approach that accounts for aberration-induced variations during placement. Our approach minimizes the design’s cycle time and prevents hold-time violations under systematic aberration-induced variations. On average, the proposed placement technique reduces cycle time by ∼ 5 % at the cost of ∼ 2 % increase in wirelength. I...|$|E
