40|$|Following an {{application}} from McNeil Nutritionals and Raisio Nutrition Ltd, submitted for authorisation {{of a health}} claim pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924 / 2006 via the Competent Authority of the United Kingdom, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked {{to deliver an opinion}} on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to the consumption of 2 g/day of plant stanols (as plant stanol esters) as part of a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> and a two-fold greater reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to the consumption of a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> alone. The food {{that is the subject of}} the health claim, plant stanol esters, is sufficiently characterised. The applicant provided five human intervention studies for the scientific substantiation of the claim. The Panel notes that the design of the studies submitted did not allow an evaluation of the quantitative effects of diets <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> per se on blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Therefore, the effect of consuming 2 g/day plant stanols as part of a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> relative to the effect of consuming a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> alone cannot be determined on a quantitative basis. The Panel considers that the evidence provided by the applicant does not establish that the consumption of 2 g/day of plant stanols (as plant stanol esters) as part of a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> results <b>in</b> a two-fold greater reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with consuming a diet <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fat</b> alone. A claim on plant stanol esters and reduction of blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations (irrespective of the background diet) has already been authorised in the European Union...|$|R
5|$|Guinea pig meat is high {{in protein}} and <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and cholesterol, and is {{described}} as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and digestible carbohydrates, {{and high in}} protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the utility of}} an {{extended}} version {{of the theory of}} planned behaviour that included a measure of planning, in the prediction of eating foods <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fats</b> among adults diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease Participants (N = 184) completed questionnaires assessing standard theory of planned behaviour measures (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control) and the additional volitional variable of planning in relation to eating foods <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fats</b> Self-report consumption of foods low insaturated fats was assessed 1 month later In partial support of the theory of planned behaviour, results indicated that attitude and subjective norm predicted intentions to eat foods <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fats</b> and intentions and perceived behavioural control predicted the consumption of foods <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fats</b> As an additional variable, planning predicted the consumption of foods <b>low</b> <b>in</b> saturated <b>fats</b> directly and also mediated the intention-behaviour and perceived behavioural control-behaviour relationships, suggesting an important role for planning as a post-intentional construct determining healthy eating choices. Suggestions are offered for interventions designed to improve adherence to healthy eating recommendations for people diagnosed with these chronic conditions with a specific emphasis on the steps and activities that are required to promote a healthier lifestyle.

5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat.</b> They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E

5000|$|Post-surgery, {{overeating}} is curbed because {{exceeding the}} capacity of the stomach causes nausea and vomiting. Diet restrictions after recovery from surgery depend in part on the type of surgery. Many patients will need to take a daily multivitamin pill for life to compensate for reduced absorption of essential nutrients. [...] Because patients cannot eat a large quantity of food, physicians typically recommend a diet that is relatively high <b>in</b> protein and <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and alcohol.|$|R

25|$|Traditional {{subsistence}} foods, such as {{fish and}} marine mammals, {{and to a}} lesser extent shellfish, are the only significant direct dietary sources of two important types of the omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA protect against heart disease and possibly diabetes. The replacement of a subsistence diet that is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and high in omega-3s with a market-based Western diet has increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Alaska Natives. Many market (store-bought) foods are high in fats, carbohydrates, and sodium; and these may lead to increased weight gain, high cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), and chronic diseases.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have been}} farmed in South Africa {{since the beginning}} of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and raised them successfully on their property, and were able to obtain a crop of feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron. Uncooked, it is dark red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.|$|E
