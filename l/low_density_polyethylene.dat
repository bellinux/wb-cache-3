Stronger shear thinning and a linear composition dependence of the zero-shear viscosity were observed for the VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1 and VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2 blends.

50|$|Block or graft {{copolymers}} {{are commonly}} used as compatibilizing agents. The copolymer used is made of the two components in the immiscible blend. The respective portions of the copolymer are able {{to interact with the}} two phases of the blend to make the phase morphology more stable. The increased stability is caused by reducing the size of the phase-separated particles in the blend. The size reduction comes from the lower interfacial tension, due to accumulating block copolymers at the many interfaces between the two copolymers. This helps the immiscible blends break up into smaller particles in the melt phase. In turn, these phase separated particles will not be as inclined to consolidate and grow because the interfacial tension is now much lower. This stabilizes the polymer blend to a usable product. An example of this are Ethylene/propylene copolymers. They are able to act as good compatibilizing agents for blends of polypropylene and <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene.</b> In this specific application, longer ethylene sequences are preferred in the copolymer.

40|$|In this paper, the {{predictions}} of the Pompom constitutive model in medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) are examined using Fourier transform rheology (FTR). FTR is commonly used in combination with small amplitude oscillatory shear to fit linear Maxwell parameters to dynamic moduli, and in this paper, this process is expanded to larger strain amplitudes and to further terms in the Fourier series. For both small and large amplitudes, these higher harmonics are dependent on the nonlinear Pompom parameters and the Pompom parameter space is explored to see how experimental oscillatory shear data can infer molecular detail. In the regime of small and medium strain amplitude, there exists an asymptotic solution to the Pompom equations which depends only on {{the ratio of the}} orientation and stretch relaxation times, τb and τs.
