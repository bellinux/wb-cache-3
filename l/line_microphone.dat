40|$|In {{order to}} {{counteract}} the problem of railway noise and its environmental impact, passing trains in Europe must be tested in accordance to a noise legislation that demands the quantification of the noise generated by the vehicle alone. However, for frequencies between about 500  Hz and 1600  Hz, {{it has been found}} that {{a significant part of the}} measured noise is generated by the rail, which behaves like a distributed source and radiates plane waves as a result of the contact with the train's wheels. Thus the need arises for separating the rail contribution to the pass-by noise in that particular frequency range. To this end, the present paper introduces a wavenumber–domain filtering technique, referred to as wave signature extraction, which requires a <b>line</b> <b>microphone</b> array parallel to the rail, and two accelerometers on the rail in the vertical and lateral direction. The novel contributions of this research are: (i) the introduction and application of wavenumber (or plane–wave) filters to pass-by data measured with a microphone array located in the near-field of the rail, and (ii) the design of such filters without prior information of the structural properties of the rail. The latter is achieved by recording the array pressure, as well as the rail vibrations with the accelerometers, before and after the train pass-by. The performance of the proposed method is investigated with a set of pass-by measurements performed in Germany. The results seem to be promising when compared to reference data from TWINS, and the largest discrepancies occur above 1600  Hz and are attributed to plane waves radiated by the rail that so far have not been accounted for in the design of the filters.

50|$|In most {{landline}} telephones, {{the transmitter}} and receiver (microphone and speaker) {{are located in the}} handset, although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure. Powered by the <b>line,</b> the <b>microphone</b> (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm. The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the coil of the receiver (A3). The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver's diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter.|$|R
