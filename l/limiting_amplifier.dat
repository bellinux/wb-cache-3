40|$|High-speed {{limiting}} amplifiers {{are widely}} used in data transmission systems. First, limiting amplifiers {{can be used in}} die clock recovery circuit including a passive filter (1) to suppress the amplitude variation of the clock signal detected from the input data Second, a <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be used as the main amplifier of an optical data receiver(2). In comparison with gain controlled amplifiers (3), in which the amplitude of the data stream is regulated manually or by means of a voltage detected from the data stream, die amplitude regulating function of a <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> directly acts on each single bit. A <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> can therefore suppress both of the fast and slow amplitude variations. There exists no time constant problem in a <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> as in a gain controlled one. In addition the design of a <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> is simpler.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of optical communication {{systems in the}} access network and for short-haul datacom applications {{requires the use of}} low-cost plastic packages: the functional block most affected is the <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier,</b> that is often the first stage of the Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) IC. In this paper we illustrate the design issues of the input-matching and offset-cancelling network for a differential <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> for optical communication systems, with particular emphasis on the effect of bond wires. We discuss the limitations of passive feedback networks when used both for offset suppression and for input matching, and propose a topology that overcomes such limitations by using an active feedback loop. A 50 -loaded differential pair is used to achieve input matching and high offset suppression, and its buffering action desensitizes the input matching from the effect of the bond wires connecting off-chip filtering capacitors. Very good performance even with low cost plastic packages can be achieved by solving the trade-off between power consumption, offset suppression and the value of the low-pass filtering capacitors.

40|$|Although many {{descriptions}} of modulation {{describe it as}} a multiplication process, the truth {{is a bit more}} complex. First, to be quite clear, if the two inputs of a perfect multiplier were fed with a signal, Acos(ωt), and an unmodulated carrier, cos(ωt), we would have a modulator. This happens because the two periodic waveforms, A scos(ω st) and A ccos(ω ct), applied to the inputs of a multiplier (with a scale factor of 1 V for simplicity of analysis), produce an output given by: V o(t) = A sA c[cos((ω s + ω c) t) + cos(ω s – ω c) t)) ] If the carrier, A ccos(ω ct), has 1 V amplitude (A c = 1), this further simplifies to: V o(t) = A s[cos((ω s + ω c) t) + cos((ω s – ω c) t) ] But, in most cases, a modulator is a better circuit to perform this function. A modulator (also called a mixer when it is used as a frequency changer) is closely related to a multiplier. The output of a multiplier is the instantaneous product of its inputs. The output of a modulator is the instantaneous product of the signal on one of its inputs (known as the signal input) and the sign of the signal on the other input (known as the carrier input). Figure 1 shows two ways of modeling the modulation function: as an amplifier whose gain is switched positive and negative by the output of a comparator on its carrier input, or as a multiplier with a high-gain <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> between the carrier input and one of its ports. Both architectures have been used to produce modulators, but the switched amplifier version (used in the AD 630 balanced modulator) tends to be slower. Most high-speed integrated circuit modulators consist of a translinear multiplier (based on the Gilbert cell) with a <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> in the carrier path overdriving one of the inputs. This <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifier</b> may provide high gain, allowing a low-level carrier input—or low gain and clean limiting characteristics, thus requiring a comparatively large carrier input for correct operation.

40|$|As {{the energy}} {{relaxation}} time of superconducting qubits steadily improves, non-equilibrium quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap emerge as an increasingly relevant limit for qubit coherence. We measure {{fluctuations in the}} number of quasiparticle excitations by continuously monitoring the spontaneous quantum jumps between the states of a fluxonium qubit, in conditions where relaxation is dominated by quasiparticle loss. Resolution on the scale of a single quasiparticle is obtained by performing quantum non-demolition projective measurements within a time interval much shorter than $T_ 1 $, using a quantum <b>limited</b> <b>amplifier</b> (Josephson Parametric Converter). The quantum jumps statistics switches between the expected Poisson distribution and a non-Poissonian one, indicating large relative fluctuations in the quasiparticle population, on time scales varying from seconds to hours.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} full {{integration}} of broadband transceivers [1, 2] makes it desirable to realize front-end circuits such as <b>limiting</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (LAs) and laser/modulator drivers (LMDs) in CMOS technology.

The low transconductance of MOS devices, the limited voltage headroom, and the large voltage swings necessary for CMOS CDR circuits create a tight performance envelope that severely constrains the speed of CMOS LAs. Furthermore, unlike their bipolar counterparts, the first few gain stages in a CMOS LA operate linearly, exhibiting a small-signal behavior and hence a smaller bandwidth.

We address this question in the relevant case of continuous variable quantum teleportation protocols implemented using two-mode Gaussian states with a limited degree of entanglement and energy. We first characterize the class of single-mode phase-insensitive Gaussian channels that can be simulated via a Braunstein [...] Kimble protocol with non-unit gain and minimum shared entanglement, showing that infinite energy is not necessary apart from the special cases of the quantum <b>limited</b> attenuator and <b>amplifier.</b> We also find that, apart from the identity, all phase-insensitive Gaussian channels can be simulated through a two-mode squeezed state with finite energy, albeit with a larger entanglement. We then consider the problem of teleporting single-mode coherent states with Gaussian-distributed displacement in phase space. Performing a geometrical optimization over phase-insensitive Gaussian channels, we determine the maximum average teleportation fidelity achievable with any finite entanglement and for any realistically finite variance of the input distribution.
