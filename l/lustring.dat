60|$|Once {{or twice}} I {{asked what was}} the matter, but the people {{neglected}} answering me, and I was not very importunate; but after the crowd was wholly past, I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away. This, indeed, I did with less disturbance than I had done formerly, for these things I did not steal, but they were stolen to my hand. I got safe to my lodgings with this cargo, which {{was a piece of}} fine black <b>lustring</b> silk, and a piece of velvet; the latter was but part of a piece of about eleven yards; the former was a whole piece of near fifty yards. It seems it was a mercer's shop that they had rifled. I say rifled, because the goods were so considerable that they had lost; for the goods that they recovered were pretty many, and I believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk. How they came to get so many I could not tell; but as I had only robbed the thief, I made no scruple at taking these goods, and being very glad of them too.|$|E

Depending on the concentration of gold in the <b>lustring</b> compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The gold lustre could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to batik, the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.|$|E
50|$|The book is subtitled And {{showing the}} Pernicious Consequences of CREDIT, {{and that it}} destroys the Purpose of National Trade...and thus it's no {{surprise}} that Gervaise concludes the special favors granted in mercantilism, essentially protectionism and state-imposed corporate oligopoly and funding, are harmful {{to the economy and}} have caused many of the more recent inflation problems. At the time of its publication, in fact, the Royal <b>Lustring</b> Company had lost its own charter amid scandal, after having operated for the previous 23 years in such a capacity. The company, which dealt in the manufacture of fabric using Asian silk, had gone out of business in a catastrophic way that would seem familiar with the corporate crises of the early 21st century, including a calls for a bailout and trade protection. His own family an investor in that company, all of this is alluded to by Gervaise in his own book's foreword.|$|E
