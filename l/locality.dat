5|$|Miniopterus tao {{has only}} been {{recorded}} from <b>Locality</b> 1 at Zhoukoudian; <b>Locality</b> 3 contains a smaller Miniopterus identified as M. schreibersii. <b>Locality</b> 1 is Pleistocene in age (between about 2 million and 10,000 years old) and also contains Ia io and species of Rhinolophus and Myotis among bats, in addition to Homo erectus.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{belonging}} to the genus were first discovered in a <b>locality</b> near Xinmin in Guizhou, China in 2002. At the same <b>locality,</b> which dates to 244 million years ago, other marine reptiles such as Mixosaurus, Keichousaurus, and Wumengosaurus have also been found. While the type specimen consisted only of a skull and the very front of the neck, additional specimens soon revealed the complete form of the body. Further discoveries of Dinocephalosaurus specimens were made in Luoping, Yunnan, China, starting in 2008. At this <b>locality,</b> Dinocephalosaurus would have lived alongside Mixosaurus, Dianopachysaurus, and Sinosaurosphargis. One specimen discovered at the Luoping <b>locality</b> preserves a fetus within its abdomen, indicating that Dinocephalosaurus gave birth to live young like many other marine reptiles. Dinocephalosaurus {{is one of the}} few known members of the Archosauromorpha which are known to give live birth, asides from the metriorhynchids, a group of marine crocodylomorphs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species and}} forms were {{described}} before 1800, {{most of them}} with inadequate <b>locality</b> data. At least two names — Amphidromus laevus (Müller, 1774) and the form A. perversus f. aureus Martyn, 1784 — still (as of 2017) {{have not yet been}} reported from a precise <b>locality.</b> During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, many species and varieties were named, again usually with poor <b>locality</b> data. Not until Eduard von Martens (1867) published his monograph was there an attempt to cover the entire complex of species within this genus. The 1867 monograph contained considerable information both on the variation within the genus, and on the problems of the geographic distribution of the species. Many concepts that originated with von Martens are still (as of 2017) in use.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{additional}} Dinocephalosaurus specimens {{were discovered}} from the slightly older Luoping <b>locality,</b> {{which has been}} dated to 245–244 million years old based on conodont biostratigraphy as well as preliminary radiometric dating. The specimens originate from bed 74 of the Luoping <b>locality,</b> in deposits located {{near the village of}} Dawazi, Luoping County, Yunnan, China. Bed 74 is part of a section composed of thin dark grey micritic limestone layers mixed with thicker layers of siliceous limestone and silty limestone, which extends downwards to bed 67.|$|E

5|$|The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) also {{conducted}} excavations {{south of the}} town of Emery from 2009 to 2010, with permits from the Utah Geological Survey. These excavations were conducted in a site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH <b>locality</b> UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements were collected in two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements from the hip and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017. Another <b>locality</b> discovered by the FMNH is the Triple Peak quarry, FMNH <b>locality</b> UT130904-2, which contains a bonebed of over 400 juvenile bones that belong to at least four individuals.|$|E
