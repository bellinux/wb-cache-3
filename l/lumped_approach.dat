The authors propose an electromagnetic model for a linear synchronous machine through this <b>lumped</b> <b>approach.</b> In this research, the linear machine is separated into many small parts. Then, compute all the magnetic reluctances of them with analytical method and acquire the reluctance network. After that the authors couple the electrical part and magnetic part through electromagnetic coupling method.

Matrix diagrams (MDs) {{are known to be}} a space-efficient, symbolic representation of large CTMCs. In this paper, we identify local conditions for exact and ordinary lumpings that allow us to lump MD representations of Markov models in a compositional manner. We propose a lumping algorithm for CTMCs that are represented as MDs that is based on partition refinement, is applied to each level of an MD directly, and results in an MD representation of the lumped CTMC. Our compositional <b>lumping</b> <b>approach</b> is complementary to other known model-level <b>lumping</b> <b>approaches</b> for matrix diagrams.

Hydrological modelling is required to understand terrestrial water balance and to provide scientifically sound estimates on water availability. This article aims at two related objectives: First the water balance of the UJC, a hydrogeologically complex catchment located at the borders of Israel, Syria and the Lebanon, is investigated. It is {{for the first time}} that a physically based model is set up for this region that accounts both for the entire terrestrial water balance and in particular for the groundwater-surface water interaction. It is shown that the model is able to describe observed river discharges satisfactorily. Secondly, it is investigated if observed and simulated runoff components can be explained by simple <b>lumped</b> <b>approaches</b> based on 1) linear filter theory and 2) neural networks and what the number of degrees of freedom for the runoff components is. It is exemplary shown for the Ayun subcatchment of the UJC that the simulated river discharge, the direct runoff component and the interflow runoff component as modelled by the physically based distributed hydrological model WaSiM can be described by simple effective equations with only 3 to 5 degrees of freedom. Application of simple <b>lumped</b> <b>approaches</b> to observed river discharge values showed much weaker performance...|$|R

Therefore, a controller design based on a population balance model is proposed. A late <b>lumping</b> <b>approach</b> is used where the controller design {{is based on an}} irrational transfer function resulting from the linearized population balance. The resulting irrational controller transfer function is then approximated by a rational one. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated in simulations. The proposed feedback control enables the use of high fines dissolution rates and hence the improvement of CSD properties...|$|R

40|$|The term "Natural Attenuation " (NA) {{has been}} defined as naturally-occurring {{processes}} in soil and groundwater environments that act without human intervention to reduce the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume, or concentration of contaminants in those media. Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) protocols generally involve the collection of biogeochemical data from groundwater monitoring wells at sites. The data are correlated in time and space with the various chemicals of concern (COC’s) to establish predominant biodegradation mechanisms. Modelers using the first-order decay expression typically use the rate coefficient as a calibration parameter and adjust it until the transport model results match field data. With this approach, uncertainties with a number of parameters (e. g., dispersion, sorption, biodegradation, etc.) are lumped together in a single calibration parameter. We examine the problems associated with the <b>lumped</b> parameter <b>approach</b> using two commonly used models, BIOSCREEN and Buscheck/Alcantar Analytical Solution in a variety of practical examples. The natural attenuation decay rate estimated using the <b>lumped</b> parameter <b>approach</b> is distinguished from a biodegradation rate established by isolating processes and examining biodegradation lines of evidence.

In this work, we develop a model-based prognostics approach for a rotary valve actuator. Due to limited observability of the component with multiple failure modes, a <b>lumped</b> damage <b>approach</b> is proposed for estimation and prediction of damage progression. In order to support the goal of real-time prognostics, an approach to prediction is developed that does not require online simulation to compute remaining life, rather, a function mapping the damage state to remaining useful life is found offline so that predictions can be made quickly online with a single function evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate the overall methodology, validating the <b>lumped</b> damage <b>approach</b> and demonstrating real-time prognostics...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} DSM- 5 sleep-wake {{disorders}} classification was, {{from the}} outset, to facilitate the differential diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints, given their ubiquity in psychiatric practice, and to clarify when referral to a sleep disorders specialist is appropriate. The classification encompasses 10 disorders or disorder groups: insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, non-REM (NREM) sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and substanceor medication-induced sleep disorder. The core features of each disorder relate to the patient’s dissatisfaction regarding the quality, timing, and amount of sleep with resulting daytime distress and impairment.

Consistent and lumped coefficient matrix solutions for such problems are compared. The consistent approach may produce more accurate boundary quantities, but spurious oscillations may be produced {{in the vicinity of}} discontinuities. The uncoupled computations of the <b>lumped</b> <b>approach</b> provide greater flexibility in dealing with discontinuities and provide increased computational efficiency. The consistent boundary quantity approach can be applied to solution boundaries other than those with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and provides more accurate results than the customary method of differentiation of interpolation polynomials...|$|E
40|$|A lumped {{kinetic model}} of methyl {{butanoate}} pyrolysis and oxidation is presented and {{discussed in this}} work. The hierarchical approach first required the development and validation of sub-mechanisms of small esters such as methyl formate, methyl acrylate and methyl crotonate. A broad-ranging validation of the whole kinetic scheme of methyl butanoate oxidation was then carried out through comparisons with experimental data obtained in shock tube devices, plug flow and jet stirred reactors, rapid compression machines and premixed laminar flames. A detailed analysis of laminar flame speeds complements and extends this kinetic study. The lumped model predicts {{a wide range of}} experiments well, thus constituting a flexible and reliable kinetic scheme despite the reduced number of species involved.

City planners and developers rely on accurate hydrologic models, which {{enable them to}} design flood-proof developments and effectively mitigate flooding downstream. Common hydrologic models use a <b>lumped</b> <b>approach,</b> which averages the physical characteristics of basins for model calculations, limiting their ability to estimate runoff within the basin.

50|$|Further {{analysis}} with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) {{and a third}} plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/Ornithogalum. Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, Ornithogalum corresponding to clade C, placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into subgenera and sections, with 160 species. Galtonia was retained as a taxon, but at the subgenus level. An alternative approach was suggested by combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology, and biogeography. This supported Manning's clade C within which Ornithogalum was contained, but the very large subgenus Ornithogalum was noted to still be heterogeneous, which they had managed by treating it as seven sections.

The result is a trade-off between operational cost and product quality.

A simple algorithm for stage–discharge prediction based on a lumped resistance approach was then proposed. It requires calibration of the overbank Manning n for a relative depth zero and a coefficient of proportionality, and this is achievable if measurements of the flow depth and velocity are taken for at least three overbank flow discharges.
