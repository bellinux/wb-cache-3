40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to execute strength analysis of knuckle, which is made from FCD 50, by using static analysis on maximum loading. This maximum loading is obtained from front axle <b>loading</b> <b>calculation</b> on particular operating condition. That is, vehicle is braking while cornering in down hill. From previous vehicle <b>loading</b> <b>calculation,</b> we get a number of loading values on different speed and deceleration. At the end, we get a value of speed and deceleration that guarantee the vehicle safety if it is braking while cornering in down hill. As comparison, <b>loading</b> <b>calculation</b> is executed too for same operating condition on level ground. This is because of different deceleration for each operating condition, 0, 5 g for operating condition on downhill and 0, 2 g on level ground. The result shows that maximum loading occurred when vehicle is operated on down hill is larger than on level ground. Study of static focused on quantitative description of loads that act on technical structure in equilibrium. <br...|$|R
30|$|PSS/E (Power System Simulator/Engineering) is {{a widely}} used {{analytical}} software for electrical power engineering oriented simulations. Its <b>load</b> flow <b>calculation</b> engine can only be directly used for <b>load</b> flow <b>calculations</b> of AC systems and point to point DC systems, but is not suitable directly for the DC <b>load</b> flow <b>calculations</b> of a DC grid. This paper uses the AC equivalent method for AC <b>load</b> flow <b>calculations</b> of the PSSE to indirectly calculate the DC load flow of a DC grid, i.e., the use of AC components to build an equivalent DC grid system and to calculate the corresponding power flows. The equivalent AC power flow calculated results reflect the DC power flow distributions of the DC grid, so as to realize the function of DC <b>load</b> flow <b>calculations.</b> This method has been verified by modelling the CIGRE B 4 DC grid test system mentioned in Sect. 1 and the same load flow results were obtained {{to those of the}} test system given in [23, 24].|$|R

Each system must also have equipment that meets the minimum efficiency that is in {{a table in the}} ASHRAE 90.1 document. The pipes that hold the hot water need to be insulated and there are certain insulation requirements for each system type and piping material. There are many controls that hot water systems need and each control has a different requirement. These include are temperature controls, temperature maintenance controls, outlet temperature controls, and circulation pump controls. There are also requirements for pool heaters, pool covers, and heat traps for heated pools.|$|E
50|$|The {{cooling load}} is {{calculated}} to select HVAC equipment {{that has the}} appropriate cooling capacity to remove heat from the zone. A zone is typically defined as an area with similar heat gains, similar temperature and humidity control requirements, or an enclosed space within a building with the purpose to monitor and control the zone's temperature and humidity with a single sensor e.g. thermostat. Cooling <b>load</b> <b>calculation</b> methodologies take into account heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation. Methodologies include heat balance, radiant time series, cooling load temperature difference, transfer function, and sol-air temperature. Methods calculate the cooling load in either steady state or dynamic conditions and some can be more involved than others. These methodologies and others {{can be found in}} ASHRAE handbooks, ISO Standard 11855, European Standard (EN) 15243, and EN 15255. ASHRAE recommends the heat balance method and radiant time series methods.|$|E

40|$|Scope and Method: This thesis focuses {{mainly on}} the {{development}} of a <b>load</b> <b>calculation</b> software program. Technical routines for building cooling load and heat extraction rate calculations were developed based on the revised Transfer Function Method (TFM). Heating <b>load</b> <b>calculation</b> routines were also developed. The program is user-interactive, menu-driven, and works under a graphical user interface. Cooling load results obtained by the CLTD/SCL/CLF (Cooling Load Temperature Difference/Solar Cooling Load/Cooling Load Factor) method, a simplified <b>load</b> <b>calculation</b> method, were compared to those obtained by the revised TFM. Tests were carried out for three representative zones and a number of cases involving externally shaded glass areas. Findings and Conclusions: A number of implementation and methodological differences in the two methods are pointed out and suitable corrections are suggested where applicable. The CLTD/SCL/CLF method was validated as a fairly accurate method for manual cooling load calculations.
