60|$|This right {{seems to}} have been {{asserted}} by the Managers for the Commons in the case of Lord Stafford, 32 Charles II.[77] The Managers in that case claimed it as the right of the Commons to produce witnesses for the purpose of fortifying their former evidence. Their claim was admitted by the court. It is an adjudged case in the Law of Parliament. Your Committee is well aware that the notorious perjury and infamy of the witnesses in the trial of Lord Stafford has been used to throw a shade of doubt and suspicion on all that was transacted on that occasion. But there is no force in such an objection. Your Committee has no concern in the defence of these witnesses, nor of the Lords who found their verdict on such testimony, nor of the morality of those who produced it. Much may be said to palliate errors {{on the part of the}} prosecutors and judges, from the heat of the times, arising from the great interests then agitated. But it is plain there may be perjury in witnesses, or even conspiracy unjustly to prosecute, without the least doubt of the <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> <b>regularity</b> of the proceedings in any part. This is too obvious and too common to need argument or illustration. The proceeding in Lord Stafford's case never has, now for an hundred and fourteen years, either in the warm controversies of parties, or in the cool disquisitions of lawyers or historians, been questioned. The perjury of the witnesses has been more doubted at some periods than the regularity of the process has been at any period. The learned lawyer who led for the Commons in that impeachment (Serjeant Maynard) had, near forty years before, taken a forward part in the great cause of the impeachment of Lord Strafford, and was, perhaps, of all men then in England, the most conversant in the law and usage of Parliament. Jones was one of the ablest lawyers of his age. His colleagues were eminent men.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality are constructed and differentiated in mainstream French newspaper discourse. The distinction between legal and illegal migration is a particularly overt feature of the public debate on migration in France. The thesis argues that <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality are not natural givens, but social constructs that are based on moral-political judgments of what constitutes legitimate grounds for moving. By investigating how migration is given meaning, the thesis offers a critical examination of a widely spoken about but often taken-for-granted concept. This is done by analyzing three aspects of the social construction of migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality. First, the thesis investigates spatial representations of migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality. Second, it discusses how migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality are defined. Third, the thesis examines the discursive strategies that are used in French newspaper discourse in order to represent migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality in particular ways. In order to explore these questions the thesis is based on a discourse analysis of a corpus of newspaper articles taken from the 2007 and 2008 editions of two of the major national newspapers in France: Le Monde and Le Figaro. The value of a discourse analytical approach lies in its ability to analyze how we categorize and create boundaries through language and to deconstruct the often binary categorizations this engenders. The thesis project also reflects the central role of the media in shaping public action through its mediation and discussion of social phenomena. The main finding of this thesis is the identification of two distinct sets of discursive strategies of which one set is used to represent migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> the other is used in representations of migrant illegality. Understanding how migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality are constructed and differentiated is crucial in two regards. First, discourses on migrant <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> illegality inform judgments about mobile people and their practices. Second, these discourses are used to legitimize and enable particular policy responses...|$|R

40|$|Overall {{progress}} {{recorded in}} contemporary society, has increased {{at the same}} time the aspirations and expectations of the population, marked by phenomena which are based on the financial policy of the Executive. Of course, for the legislature to know the financial activity carried out by the Executive Board, in each State was established a Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution, as it is in Germany, or by law, as is the case of the United Kingdom. The variety of powers of supreme audit, is the result of various economic areas, each demonstrations through specific activities and suitable approaches to organizational cultures, which gives them their distinct identities. The work is conducted under the public responsibility with an emphasis on developing and improving continuously audit methodologies to present best practices. The two supreme institutions operate according to an annual plan of action which includes financial audit or regularity and performance auditing actions, and additional Federal Court of Audit of Germany practice preventive control institutions contained in its area of activity. By tradition, the role of supreme consists of the evaluation as regards the <b>legality</b> <b>and</b> <b>regularity</b> of financial management and accounting, but since the 80 's but it was noticeable trend internationally to audit performance or "value for money" (United Kingdom), since the latter refers to the essence of the problem and is the final attainment of the envisaged at the time of allocation of resources. The topic researched is distinguished by originality, marked being the fact that a area so important as that of external public audit is least known works, and I wish to point out the vacuum bibliographic Supreme Audit Institutions experience in the international arena and beyond. Research methodology consists in the evaluation of resources in the area, using foreign literature. For the study of the subject of this material have been followed the official sites of the Federal Court of Audit of Germany and of the National Audit Office of United Kindom, including consulting on hypothetical case studies submitted by the specialists of the two institutions on the occasion of seminars held at the Romanian Court of Auditors. This work focuses on developing institutional development,role, experience and traditions performed in the field of external public audit, as well as their relationship with the Parliament, including the measures taken as a result of recovery audit reports. Thus, the supreme institutions analysed may constitute "models" for Romania's economic reality. In our opinion, any "model" should be adapted to the situation on the field and in this case the model becomes the solution. An assessment of the current business of the supreme audit institutions, we ask where is heading and how they will look in the future. Perhaps the future will provide this response...|$|E
