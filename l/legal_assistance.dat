In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v. Minnesota, a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not {{to comply with a}} state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion.

In 1993, the Network of Defender of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Jaringan Pembela Hak-Hak Masyarakat Adat - JAPHAMA) was founded by indigenous leaders, academics, <b>legal</b> <b>assistances</b> and social movement activists in South Sulawesi Toraja.

5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for <b>legal</b> <b>assistance,</b> but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the Tests, Australia {{took on the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. Bradman's men batted first, and Miller came to {{the crease}} at 3/200. Sharing {{partnerships}} of 80 runs for the fourth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, 63 for the fifth with Brown and 155 with Ian Johnson for the sixth, Miller scored 163 runs in 250 minutes, hitting 20fours and three sixes. The Australians hit nine sixes off the off spin bowling of Jim Laker on the second morning of the match {{in an attempt to}} establish their mastery of him before the Test series. After Miller's dismissal, Australia were out for 552. With the ball, Miller and Lindwall attempted to maintain their ascendancy over Hutton, who was playing for MCC. On this occasion, he scored 52 and 64, but MCC were defeated by an innings and 158runs. Miller had figures of 3/28 and 1/37. He dismissed England Test batsman Bill Edrich, who had been a prolific scorer in recent English seasons, and was expected {{to be one of the}} key batsmen in the forthcoming Ashes series. Miller twice took the wicket of Jack Robertson, who was thought to be in contention for England selection; after two low scores against Miller, he was overlooked. In addition to his performance on the field, Miller solved some off-field problems. The MCC—which administered cricket at the time—provided him with <b>legal</b> <b>assistance</b> in his contract dispute with Rawtenstall Cricket Club. The Australian all-rounder had signed a contract to play for the club in the Lancashire League, but failed to honour it. Rawtenstall dropped the dispute after being offered compensation.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, World Bank member {{countries}} have increasingly sought Bank assistance in improving and reforming their legal systems. This paper catalogs the scope and breadth of such assistance and outlines some lessons the Bank has learned. Countries with long and established legal traditions usually seek help only in specialized areas of law, and in strengthening the judiciary and establishing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In countries with lesser developed legal systems, <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> may range from policy advice to assistance in drafting legislation, introducing, implementing, and enforcing new laws and regulations, devising procedures and institutions that carry out new laws, designing public information campaigns, and training. Lessons the Bank's Legal Department has learned include: 1) each country must make a choice {{about the direction of}} its legal reform and must assign its own priorities to reform needs; 2) the Bank-financed assistance should fit the country's needs as well as the Bank's strategies. Countries usually benefit from diagnostic studies or sector analyses; 3) the Bank may not be involved in financing legal reform activities unrelated to economic development; 4) legal reform is complex and long-term. Except for urgently needed legislation, the most suitable lending instruments for <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> are usually those that disburse over a longer time or, alternatively, a series of lending operations; 5) the Bank's support for a stable, predictable business environment free of government arbitrariness may well include assistance to the judiciary of borrowing member countries; 6) countries are often reluctant to borrow for <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance.</b> This is especially true for borrowing from the IBRD (rathen than IDA); 7) recipient governments must demonstrate a clear commitment to legal reform and take ownership of legal reform for <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> to bring about the desired results. Broad participation by members of local legal professions should be sought; 8) for <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> to succeed, there must be proper counterparts in the government implementing the assistance. Some countries may benefit from establishing legal reform units to coordinate economic and legal reform and to prevent duplication of legal reform activities; 9) for quality <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> at affordable rates, it is important to diversify the selection of advisors to include local lawyers as well as consultants from different legal systems. But the selection of consultants should be consistent with the direction of legal reform chosen by the country; 10) training activities adjusted to local conditions are essential if <b>legal</b> technical <b>assistance</b> is to have a lasting impact.
