25|$|Since the 6th century BC, {{cane sugar}} {{producers}} have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane {{in order to}} collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with lime (calcium oxide)) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually {{in the process of}} stirring, to produce sugar crystals. Centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades.

500|$|Various {{sound effects}} were newly {{recorded}} {{with the help}} of film experts from Warner Bros. Bangalter noted one example in which the sound of a busy restaurant was achieved by placing microphones in front of the forks of a group of people. In another instance, the effect of dripping water was recorded on a soundstage. Use of electronics was limited to drum machines that appear on only two tracks, a large custom-built Modcan modular synthesizer performed live by the duo, and vintage vocoders. When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the robotic vocals on the album, Bangalter expressed that it did not matter. The duo produced most of the vocoder tracks in their own private studio in Paris, with <b>later</b> <b>processing</b> done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol. Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take [...] "a week or so" [...] to find an adequate vocoder sound, and an additional few days to record the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements {{is a step in the}} <b>later</b> <b>processing.</b> Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is an orthophosphate mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|E

40|$|Ubiquitination is {{essential}} for the endocytic sorting of various G protein-coupled receptors to lysosomes. Here we identify a distinct function of this covalent modification in controlling the <b>later</b> proteolytic <b>processing</b> of receptors. Mutation of all cytoplasmic lysine residues in the murine δ-opioid receptor blocked receptor ubiquitination without preventing ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors or their subsequent delivery to lysosomes, as verified by proteolysis of extramembrane epitope tags and down-regulation of radioligand binding to the transmembrane helices. Surprisingly, a functional screen revealed that the E 3 ubiquitin ligase AIP 4 specifically controls down-regulation of wild type receptors measured by radioligand binding without detectably affecting receptor delivery to lysosomes defined both immunochemically and biochemically. This specific AIP 4 -dependent regulation required direct ubiquitination of receptors and was also regulated by two deubiquitinating enzymes, AMSH and UBPY, which localized to late endosome/lysosome membranes containing internalized δ-opioid receptor. These results identify a distinct function of AIP 4 -dependent ubiquitination in controlling the <b>later</b> proteolytic <b>processing</b> of G protein-coupled receptors, without detectably affecting their endocytic sorting to lysosomes. We propose that ubiquitination or ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycling specifically regulates <b>later</b> proteolytic <b>processing</b> events required for destruction of the receptor's hydrophobic core...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of trait anxiety on event-related potentials (ERPs) to fearful, happy, and neutral faces. Fearful faces, relative to neutral, elicited a range of effects in the low-trait anxiety (LTA) group: an enhanced visual P 1 component, an early posterior negativity (EPN), and a sustained fronto-central positivity. Emotional expression effects were generally weaker for happy faces. The enhanced fronto-central positivity and EPN triggered by fearful stimuli in LTA participants were less pronounced in the high-trait anxiety (HTA) group, while the enhancement of the visual P 1 seen in the LTA group was further augmented in the HTA group. This represents a clear dissociation across anxiety groups between rapid attentional processing as reflected by the visual P 1 and <b>later</b> strategic <b>processing</b> as reflected by fronto-central and EPN components. These effects of high-trait anxiety in potentiating initial threat evaluation but attenuating <b>later</b> cognitive <b>processing</b> {{are discussed in the}} context of the possible roles of neural systems underlying threat evaluation, cognitive avoidance, and differentiated affective responses...|$|R

The study includes two ways of plantlet production and three varieties of Virginia Species Tobacco. The results of parallel testing of tobacco production obtained from plantlets of different origins have shown that the new way of breeding has many advantages. Todd's Cells plantlet was ready for transplantation earlier and it reached the technological maturity in the open field earlier than usual. The time necessary for leaves drying was shorter in 12 hours and so the <b>later</b> <b>processings</b> (redrying, cigarettes production) were done in a shorter time. The plants in the field were more resistant to disease agents because Todd's Cells plantlets had easier adjusted to the environmental conditions. Tobacco leaf yield from Todd's Cells was significantly higher than from the traditionally produced plantlet. Raw material quality was also better. At the end. it is important to line out that the different plantlet production methods of different varieties reacted differently to yield and raw tobacco material quality...|$|R
