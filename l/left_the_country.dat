5|$|Authors {{of books}} <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in droves and some wrote {{material}} {{critical of the}} regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths {{and the concept of}} blood and soil. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime.|$|E

5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles as they <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
5|$|Margaret, by now {{seven years}} of age, sailed from Norway for Scotland {{in the autumn of}} 1290, but fell ill on the way and died in Orkney. This <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> without an obvious heir, and led to the {{succession}} dispute known to history as the Great Cause.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February it was {{announced}} that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine. The 1st Parachute Brigade handed over Haifa to the 1st Guards Brigade on 6April.

5|$|One-third of Sri Lankan Tamils {{now live}} outside Sri Lanka.

5|$|Péladan {{agreed to}} lecture {{in front of}} Societatea Ileana at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was The Genius of the Latin Race.

5|$|The {{members of}} the group {{dispersed}} after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{spirit of}} peace and {{reconciliation}} established by the Dictum of Kenilworth lasted {{for the remainder of}} Henry III's reign and into the 1290s.

When his father died in 1272, Edward felt in a safe enough position to wait until 1274 before returning home to claim the throne.|$|E
5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. As {{was the case with}} other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most part}} disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the Siad Barre {{government}} began a crackdown against the Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement (SNM) and other militant groups, which {{were among the}} {{events that led to}} the Somali Civil War. <b>The</b> conflict <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> economic and military infrastructure severely damaged. Following the collapse of Barre's government in early 1991, local authorities, led by the SNM, unilaterally declared independence from Somalia on 18 May of the same year and reinstated the borders of the former short-lived independent State of Somaliland.|$|R
50|$|Kurdaş never {{belonged to}} a {{political}} party and retained the friendship of both İsmet İnonü and Süleyman Demirel, two party leaders {{on opposite sides of}} the political spectrum. After an election, a coalition came to power. His lack of political affiliation and well-known outspokenness in policy matters kept him out of the new government. Although some of policies he proposed had not been implemented, he felt he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country’s</b> finances in good shape, with debt reduced and foreign currency reserves in place.|$|R
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E
