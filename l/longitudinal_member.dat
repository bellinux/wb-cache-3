25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|E
50|$|The {{body of the}} Macfie {{monoplane}} comprised an uncovered V-section framework made of ash wood, {{in which}} three longitudinal members were braced together at intervals of approximately 2 ft. (0.61 m) by wooden struts. The framework was approximately 3 ft. (0.91 m) in height at the forward end, tapering to 1 ft. (0.30 m) at the tail; likewise {{the width of the}} frame tapered from approx. 2 ft. 6 in. (0.76 m) at the front to 1 ft at the tail. The lowest <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member,</b> at the point of the V-section, was approximately parallel to the ground when at rest, so that the two upper members sloped gradually from front to rear.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the H-22B-3 {{is constructed}} from steel tube with a fabric covered nacelle extending forward from about the wing trailing edge. This contains the two open, under wing, tandem cockpits. Aft, the uncovered fuselage has two members, one directly above {{the other and}} interconnected {{by a series of}} diagonal stiffening tubes. The lower <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> slopes slightly upwards, tapering the fuselage in profile. This tail boom is stiffened with bracing wires to the wing spars. The rearmost section of the fuselage can be fabric covered but there is no other fixed fin. The tail unit is wooden with fabric covering and both vertical and horizontal surfaces are roughly rectangular. The tailplane is attached to the upper fuselage beam far enough forward for the rudder, which extends to the keel, to need only a small cut-out in the elevators. The H-22B-3 lands on a fixed monowheel, assisted by a rubber sprung skid under the nacelle and a tail bumper.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} was for these curved <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> {{is to be}} weakened by vertical and lateral ribs to form telescoping 'crash can' crush structures.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the terms}} [...] "longeron" [...] and [...] "stringer" [...] are used interchangeably. Historically, though, {{there is a}} subtle {{difference}} between the two terms. If the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> in a fuselage are few in number and run all along the fuselage length (usually 4 to 8), then they are called [...] "longerons". The longeron system also requires that the fuselage frames be closely spaced (about every 4 to 6 in). If the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> are numerous (usually 50 to 100) and are placed just between two formers/frames, then they are called [...] "stringers". In the stringer system the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>members</b> are smaller and the frames are spaced farther apart (about 15 to 20 in). Generally, longerons are of larger cross-section when compared to stringers. On large modern aircraft the stringer system is more common because it is more weight-efficient, despite being more complex to construct and analyze. Some aircraft use a combination of both stringers and longerons.|$|R

5000|$|The unique {{feature of}} the Auxiliary was the {{powerplant}} and its mounting. Carden had selected a 250 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled two-stroke Villiers motorcycle engine. He encouraged Villiers to persuade this engine to run inverted, {{in order to put}} the propeller line {{to the top of the}} mounting and thus minimise air resistance. This proved satisfactory, and many hours of testing with the cowling in place and at full throttle showed there were no overheating problems. A small fuel tank was fixed above the crankcase, at the top of the engine. [...] Carden also designed the engine mounting that enabled the engine and its propeller to be swung out of its housing and into action. The engine was hung to the top of the pylon bulkhead, just ahead of the trailing edge, on a diagonally cross-braced pair of tubes from the hinge to the crankcase and with V-tubes to the cylinder head. In use the engine and propeller were vertical, the latter having a small diameter to clear the lips of the open top of the fuselage. The engine was held in position by a diagonal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> attached to a nut on a screw thread which could be rotated with a crank in the cockpit. As the lower end of this member moved forward, the engine rotated into the horizontal position, its fairing closing the fuselage opening. The propeller was indexed to stop in a vertical position and its lower tip moved forward on retraction into a slot in the bulkhead, whilst the other blade pressed on a lever that caused hinged fairing doors, previously held open with springs, to close over it. With the engine retracted, the rear of the pylon was as smoothly faired as on any conventional sailplane.|$|E

40|$|Bearing reinforcement, {{which is}} {{composed}} of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> (steel deformed bar) and transverse (bearing) members (a set of equal angle steel), has been established as an effective earth reinforcement material. The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed but not for fine-grained soil. Claystone soil, abundant in Mae Moh mine, is a fine-grained material when crushed and compacted. It was proposed to be a backfill material in the Bearing Reinforcement Earth (BRE) wall for mining activities. The pullout resistance mechanism of the bearing reinforcement embedded in the claystone soil is presented in this paper. The total pullout resistance {{is the sum of}} the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from soil shear strength and interaction facto...|$|E
40|$|Small overlap frontal crashes {{occur when}} {{vehicles}} are loaded outboard of their longitudinal structural members. Studies from the 1990 s {{as well as}} current research have found that these crashes continue to account for {{a significant percentage of}} all serious frontal crashes. The National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System database was used to study the characteristics of these crashes in current model vehicles for drivers with injuries (ex-cluding extremity injuries) rated 3 or greater on the abbreviated injury scale. Cases were individually analyzed to only include vehicles in which the major-ity of the loading was located outboard of the left <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member.</b> Occupant compartment intru-sion was the primary factor in the resulting injuries, showing a strong correlation between the magnitude of intrusion and injury severity. Results suggest that vehicle designs must improve their ability to prevent occupant compartment intrusion when a vehicle is loaded at the outboard edges of its front end...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{potentially the}} using of magnesium alloy as an energy <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> used in crashworthiness applications. Since magnesium alloys are lighter weight material, they are preferred {{to use to}} decrease the environmental pollution and fuel consumptions. Non-linear finite element was used to simulate the crash behaviour of the thin walled hexagonal tube. The tube was subjected to both direct and oblique loading. Trigger mechanism was applied in this study. The aim of using trigger is to decrease the initial peak load and to enhance the energy absorption capability of the tube and also crash force efficiency. Three trigger geometries have been applied circular, rectangular and elliptical geometry. Three type of trigger distribution already have been studied. The positions {{and the size of}} triggers are also investigated. It was found that the 10 % per cent reductions with elliptical trigger revealed the best choice; it shows enhancing in energy absorption and CFE about 10 per cent and decreasing in peak force by 10 per cent too...|$|E

40|$|A {{strain gauge}} load cell with {{separate}} bridges for {{measurement of the}} pull and the bending moment in the plane containing the net neck load and pull was developed and fixed in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> of an experimental cart. A cart fitted first with pneumatic wheels and then with steel-rimmed wooden wheels was tested on three terrains—tar road, mud road and grassy terrain. Pull vs time and moment vs time records were obtained in each test and analysed. It is found that the bullocks pull the cart rather discontinuously at the low velocities at which these carts normally operate. On the tar road and the grassy terrain, the mean static coefficient of friction is significantly higher for the cart with steelrimmed wooden wheels. The dynamic frictional resistance of the terrain for the cart with steel-rimmed wooden wheels is lower than for the cart with pneumatic wheels {{so long as the}} wheels do not dig or sink into the terrain. The fluctuation in the neck load is lower in the cart fitted with pneumatic wheels. Also, the ground-induced low-amplitude high-frequency vibratory load content in the neck load is lower in the cart with pneumatic wheels. ...|$|E
40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) {{is charged}} with {{developing}} advanced technologies for space telescopes. The next generation of space optics will be very large and lightweight. Tensegrity structures are built of compressive members (bars), and tensile members (strings). For most materials, the tensile strength of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> is larger than its buckling strength; therefore a large stiffness to mass ratio {{can be achieved by}} increasing the use of tensile members. Tensegrities are the epitome of lightweight structures, since they take advantage of the larger tensile strength of materials. The compressive members of tensegrity structures are disjoint allowing compact storage of the structure. The structure has the potential to eliminate the requirement for assembly by man in space; it can be deployed by adjustments in its cable tension. A tensegrity structure can be more reliably modeled since none of the individual members experience bending moments. (Members that experience deformation in more than one dimension are much harder to model.) A. Keane and S. Brown designed a satellite boom truss system with an enhanced vibration performance. They started with a standard truss system, then used a genetic algorithm to alter the design, while optimizing the vibration performance. An improvement of over 20, 000 % in frequency-averaged energy levels was obtained using this approach. In this report an introduction to tensegrity structures is given, along with a description of how to generate the nodal coordinates and connectivity of a multiple stage cylindrical tensegrity structure. A description of how finite elements can be used to develop a stiffness and mass matrix so that the modes of vibration can be determined from the eigenvalue problem is shown. A brief description of a micro genetic algorithm is then presented...|$|E
40|$|Bearing reinforcement, {{which is}} {{composed}} of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member</b> (steel deformed bar) and transverse (bearing) members (a set of equal angle steel), has been established as an effective earth reinforcement material. The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed. The usage of locally available soils as a backfill is particularly cost effective for construction sites {{where there is a}} lack of available quality materials. The pullout resistance mechanism of the bearing reinforcement embedded in cohesive-frictional soils with various fine contents is presented in this paper. The total pullout resistance is the sum of the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from soil shear strength and interaction factor a, which is linearly related to fine content. The bearing pullout resistance of a single isolated transverse member can be approximated from the modified punching shear mechanism where the failure plane angle, b is primarily dependent upon fine content. The relationship between b and fine content is expressed by a polynomial function. The b value of p= 2 is suggested for fine contents less than 45 %. The transverse member interference is classified into three zones, depending upon spacing and dimension of transverse member, S/B ratio. The larger softened region caused by transverse member interference develops with smaller fine content. Based on a critical analysis of the test results, the pullout resistance equations for bearing reinforcement with different normal stresses, dimensions and spacing of transverse members embedded in different cohesiveefrictional soils compacted at optimum point (optimum water content and maximum dry unit weight) are developed in term of total strength parameters. The application of the proposed equations are finally illustrated and verified. The developed equations is useful for the internal stability analysis of bearing reinforcement earth walls during construction and at the end of construction...|$|E

40|$|Modern railway {{vehicles}} are requested to achieve improved performances together with higher safety for passengers and crew: {{for this reason}} recent European and National Standards claim for more demanding tests for type approval. In this contest, the initial phase of type approval’s tests became very important {{in order to achieve}} good results before the on line tests. This paper deals with the set up of test bench to perform type approval tests on carbody, used for the new Italian double deck coaches. This bench is composed by two longitudinal beams headed by two crossbeams: at one side hydraulic actuators are placed in order to apply the requested load. With a simple procedures is available to perform compression test on bumpers and also compression or traction test on a coupler a worm screw it is possible to apply both traction or compression loads to the carbody. At the other side there is only a reaction crossbeam, rigidly connected with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>member.</b> Moreover a truss structure should be mounted at one end in order to apply the load at higher levels. The reaction is, however, provided at the other side at bumper level, as stated in the European norm EN 12663. So, this test bench allowed to perform traction and compression tests, at bumpers level or in higher position (window level or roof). The driving/trailer and the trailer double deck coaches tested with this new test bench will compose the 60 new 5 coaches “Vivalto” regional train of Trenitalia developed from October 2005, with the main following characteristics: - Number of seats/places: 90 / 126 - Maximum speed: 160 Km/h The first phase regarded compression tests at bumper level. The European Standard (EN 12663) provide for 2 x 1000 kN symmetric load applied on the head beam of the carbody in the bumper zone and for 2000 kN on the coupler area. Moreover diagonal compression tests are requested: this test is performed applying a force up to 500 kN at one bumper, reacting at the opposite side. The test bench is able, with small adjustments, to provide traction test on the couplers, applying up to 1500 kN, as suggested in the EN 12663 Standard for different types of automatic coupler. In addition, the EN standard provides for compression tests at different height, applying high level loads (up to 400 kN) up to the roof level, by means of an auxiliary truss structure between test bench and carbody. Thusthese compression tests were performed in the third phase: 400 kN 150 mm over the bumpers, 300 kN at window level and 300 kN at the roof level. In the full paper the results of the test listed before will be summarised giving the evidence of the great correspondence with the results of FEM calculations...|$|E
