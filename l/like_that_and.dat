After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists.

These sessions established Moreno's name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists.

500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio.

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?"

The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would say something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> it could only come from somebody who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded.

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed".

I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E

[...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But we had some little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid and stuff <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> I don't know and just sitting here one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download.
