5|$|The 1950s decade {{ended with}} Murphy doing three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} talent {{of the era}} in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch on {{the black and white}} Cast a <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No Name on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{events that}} {{followed}} {{the passage of the}} Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy. At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India. The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention. News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India. The Russian Revolution had also cast its <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> into India. It was at this time that Mahatma Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader.|$|E

25|$|Controversy over Ern Malley {{continued}} {{for more than}} twenty years. It spread beyond Australia when it was learned that the British literary critic Herbert Read had been taken in by the hoax. Modernist novelists like Patrick White and abstract painters found themselves tarred with the Ern Malley brush. Since both McAuley and Stewart and the left-wing nationalist school around Vance and Nettie Palmer disliked the Angry Penguins version of modernism with equal venom, though for different reasons, Ern Malley cast a <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> over Australian cultural life.|$|E
25|$|From {{the decade}} of the 1930s, the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) cast a <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> as the largest Marxist {{political}} organization in the United States of America. In addition to a vast array of monthly, weekly, and daily publications in languages other than English, the Communist Party published an English-language daily newspaper in New York City, the Daily Worker. As an official organ of the CPUSA, this publication was constrained by tight central direction and rather mechanical adherence to the party's political line — factors which somewhat limited the paper's appeal to radical American intellectuals.|$|E

[...] His relief of MacArthur cast a <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> over American civil-military relations for decades. When Lyndon Johnson met with William Westmoreland in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: [...] "General, I have a lot riding on you. I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me."

500|$|The {{relief of}} MacArthur cast a <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> over American civil-military relations. When Lyndon Johnson met with General William Westmoreland in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: [...] "General, I {{have a lot}} riding on you. I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me." [...] For his part, Westmoreland and his senior colleagues were eager to avoid any hint of dissent or {{challenge}} to presidential authority. This came at a high price. In his 1998 book , then-Lieutenant Colonel (now National Security Advisor) H. R. McMaster argued that the Joint Chiefs failed in their duty to provide the President, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara or Congress with frank and fearless professional advice. This book was an influential one; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, General Hugh Shelton, gave copies to every four-star officer in the military.|$|E
500|$|Critics concurred that Grand Theft Auto V {{was among}} seventh {{generation}} console gaming's best {{and a great}} closing title before the eighth generation's emergence. Polygons Plante observed that the game would [...] "bridge between games' present and the future", and declared it [...] "the closure of this generation, and the benchmark for the next". VideoGamer.com's Simon Miller considered it [...] "the ultimate swansong for this console cycle" [...] that would [...] "cast a <b>long</b> <b>shadow</b> over the next". Three days after its release, the game ranked second on IGN's [...] "Top 25 Xbox 360 Games" [...] list. Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the open world's scale and detail succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games. He called the game [...] "a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success". In November 2013, Hardcore Gamer placed the game third on their [...] "Top 100 Games of the Generation" [...] list. They cited its improved shooting and driving mechanics over its predecessors, and considered the multiple protagonist design [...] "a welcome change of pace" [...] that could become an eighth generation gaming benchmark. In December, The Daily Telegraph listed the game among their [...] "50 best games of the console generation". They called it a [...] "cultural behemoth" [...] that [...] "will be Rockstar's lasting legacy".|$|E
