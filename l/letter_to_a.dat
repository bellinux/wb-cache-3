5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Between 814 and 816, Claudius {{also wrote}} a Chronicle. It {{begins with a}} <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> priest named Ado. This is {{followed}} by a diagram of the genealogy of Jesus going back to Adam, accompanied by commentary. A final section, which was in fact composed first, chronicles the Six Ages of the World based mainly on Bede. Claudius expends much effort in dating the events of the Old Testament according to the Christian calendar.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E

50|$|Lettera aperta a un giornale della sera (internationally {{released}} as Open <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Evening Daily and Open <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Evening Newspaper) is a 1970 Italian drama film directed by Francesco Maselli. It is centered upon {{the crisis of}} the Communist intellectuals after the 1968 protests.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and {{the souls of the}} citizenry.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Aragorn created Faramir Prince of Ithilien and {{appointed}} Beregond Captain of Faramir's guard, the White Company. Faramir, as Prince of Ithilien, {{together with the}} Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reader of The Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian city, once named Minas Ithil, that Sauron had taken) of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role of Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.|$|E
5000|$|The Art of Mentoring {{series was}} a series of books {{published}} by Basic Books from 2001 to 2008, beginning with Alan Dershowitz's <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Young Lawyer and Christopher Hitchens' <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Young Contrarian. The books were all titled in the form [...] "Letters <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Young ____", in the spirit of Rainer Maria Rilke's book <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Young Poet. They were meant to be relatively short guides to various occupations or life paths for someone starting out in that field, {{from the point of view}} of an expert.|$|R

5|$|T. E. Lawrence, perhaps {{better known}} as Lawrence of Arabia, was {{stationed}} at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a revised version of his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby in a <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend at the time, saying: I'm too shy {{to go looking for}} dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|When Priestley's friend Theophilus Lindsey {{decided to}} found a new Christian {{denomination}} that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid. On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first Unitarian service in Britain, at the newly formed Essex Street Chapel in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley defended his friend in the pamphlet <b>Letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church (1774), claiming that only the form of worship had been altered, not its substance, and attacking those who followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended Lindsey's church regularly in the 1770s and occasionally preached there. He continued to support institutionalised Unitarianism {{for the rest of}} his life, writing several Defenses of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.|$|E
