60|$|Captain Kidd's {{conscience}} {{seems to}} have been a good deal in his way; for although he had been sailing about in various eastern waters, taking prizes wherever he could, he was anxious that reports of his misdeeds should not get home before him. Having captured a fine vessel bound westward, he took from her all the booty he could, and then proceeded to arrange matters so that the capture of this ship should appear to be a <b>legal</b> <b>transaction.</b> The ship was manned by Moors and commanded by a Dutchman, and of course Kidd had no right to touch it, but the sharp-witted and business-like pirate selected one of the passengers and made him sign a paper declaring that he was a Frenchman, and that he commanded the ship. When this statement had been sworn to before witnesses, Kidd put the document in his pocket so that if he were called upon to explain the transaction he might be able to show that he had good reason to suppose that he had captured a French ship, which, of course, was all right and proper.|$|E
6000|$|... "It has, indeed. Now look at {{that very}} decision, for instance, as the measure of its knowledge. An editor of a {{newspaper}} holds up a literary man {{to the world as}} one anxious to obtain a small sum of money, in order to put it into Wall street, for 'shaving purposes.' Now, the only material question raised was the true signification of the word 'shaving.' If to say a man is a 'shaver,' in the sense in which it is applied to the use of money, be bringing him into discredit, then was the plaintiff's declaration sufficient; if not, it was insufficient, being wanting in what is called an 'innuendo.' The dictionaries, and men in general, understand by 'shaving,' 'extortion,' and nothing else. To call a man a 'shaver' is to say he is an 'extortioner,' without going into details. But, in Wall street, and among money-dealers, certain transactions that, in their eyes, and by the courts, are not deemed discreditable, have of late been brought within the category of 'shaving.' Thus it is technically, or by convention among bankers, termed 'shaving' if a man buy a note at less than its face, which is a <b>legal</b> <b>transaction.</b> On the strength of this last circumstance, as is set forth in the published opinions, the highest Court of Appeals in New York has decided that it does not bring a man into discredit to say he is a 'shaver!'--thus making a conventional signification of the brokers of Wall street higher authority {{for the use of the}} English tongue than the standard lexicographers, and all the rest of those who use the language! On the same principle, if a set of pickpockets at the Five Points should choose to mystify their trade a little by including the term 'to filch' the literal borrowing of a pocket-handkerchief, it would not be a libel to accuse a citizen of 'filching his neighbor's handkerchief!'" ...|$|E

Since the new Adult Guardianship Act 2011 by way of the revision of Korean Civil Code came into force as from 1 st July 2013, it has been imminent to revise the Civil Procedure Act provisions relevant to the litigation capacity of mentally or intellectually disabled adults. At the same time, it has been expected for the UN CRPD provisions relevant to the protection of persons with impairments to decision making abilities, especially due to dementia, developmental disabilities, mental illness and brain injury, to be reflected to the revised legislation of Civil Procedure Act. The Draft Amendments of Civil Procedure Act, prepared by the Ministry of Justice, reflects such a demand to the effect that the provisions of UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are as much as possible respected unless they are incompatible with Korean current civil law regime.
