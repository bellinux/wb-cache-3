The theme of his programme was “Society’s Commercial Choice - Risks and Rewards of Markets”. The lectures emphasised the proper functioning of markets in realising societal goals, and the obligation on society to try to use market forces wherever suitable, as opposed to unnecessary regulation, hidden subsidy or inappropriate taxation. During the public lectures he presented research on valuing sustainable certification and corporate social responsibility using risk/reward options, applying measurement ranges to audit (Confidence Accounting), developing standards markets, liquidity estimation through supply-demand curve prediction, and discerning the role of 'feedforward' in creating <b>leptokurtic</b> market outcomes. [...] During the series he made observations about sustainability, market solutions to social problems, risk, the role of government, the rising paradox of money as a positional good, taxation, long term discount rates, intellectual property managed as an option, corruption, and lotteries as misery indicators. [...] The lecture series concluded by outlining a more general theory of commerce.

However, two puzzles, emerged from many empirical investigations, have got much attention recently, namely (a) the <b>leptokurtic</b> feature that the return distribution of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails {{than those of the}} normal distribution, and (b) an empirical abnormity called "volatility smile" in option pricing. To incorporate both the <b>leptokurtic</b> feature and smile", this paper proposes, for the purpose of studying option pricing, a jump diffusion model, in which the price of the underlying asset is modeled by two parts, a continuous part driven by Brownian motion, and a jump part with the logarithm of the jump sizes having a double exponential distribution. In addition to the above two desirable properties, <b>leptokurtic</b> feature and smile", the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions for a variety of option pricing problems, including options, future options, and interest rate derivatives, such as caps and floors, in terms of the Hh function. Although there are many models can incorporate some of the three properties (the <b>leptokurtic</b> feature, "volatility smile", and analytical tractability), the current model can incorporate all three under a unified framework...|$|E

30|$|The {{grain size}} {{distributions}} of the analysed samples (Figs. 3 – 6 and 8, Table 1) revealed large variations. The mean grain size ranges from − 0.61 phi (very coarse sand) to 5.78 phi (coarse silt). However, {{the mean for}} most of the samples was in medium, fine and very fine sand classes. The IOT deposits range from very poorly sorted to well sorted, but more than 50 % of the analysed samples fall in the poorly sorted sediment class. Skewness describes the asymmetry of the grain size distribution. The tsunami deposits represent the entire range of grain size distributions, from very coarse skewed to very fine skewed. Kurtosis defines the peakedness of the size distribution. The studied sediments also represent the entire range of grain size distributions, from very platycurtic to very <b>leptokurtic</b> distributions; the <b>leptokurtic</b> and very <b>leptokurtic</b> distribution types are the most common.

The Pearson Chi-Square statistic is generally more powerful for the increasing, unimodal, <b>leptokurtic,</b> platykurtic andbath-tub shaped alternatives. Finally, both the Nominal Kolmogorov- Smirnov and the Pearson Chi-Square test statistic are generally more powerful for the bimodal alternative. We also address the issue of the sensitivity of the test statistics to the alternatives under the ‘zig-zag’ null. In comparison to the uniform null of Steele and Chaseling [10], our investigation shows that the Discrete KS test statistic is most sensitive to the decreasing trend alternative; the Pearson Chi-Square statistic is most sensitive to both the <b>leptokurtic</b> and platykurtic trend alternatives.
