50|$|The {{projective}} <b>line</b> <b>over</b> {{a division}} ring {{results in a}} single auxiliary point ∞ = U(1,0). Examples include the real projective line, the complex projective line, and the projective <b>line</b> <b>over</b> quaternions. These examples of topological rings have the projective line as their one-point compactifications. The case of the complex number field has the Möbius group as its homography group.|$|R
